abstract = {The classification of brain signals using machine learning techniques is a powerful tool in the detection of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. One of the most often used signals is electroencephalography (EEG). Different classification methods have been applied to the analysis of EEG waves with success, such as the support vec- tor machine. We apply deep learning classification to EEG signals for the detection of epilepsy using a convolutional neural network. Besides that this approach advantageously requires no feature extraction, another novelty of this ap- proach is that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a single channel EEG. Numerical experimentation on a standard test data set shows a 90% or higher accuracy on average.},

abstract = {In recent years, with development of the Internet hospitals and natural language processing technology, intelligent medical guidance based on machine learning has been gained increasing attentions. Medical text classification is indispensable for intelligent medical guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based model named CNN-MHA-BLSTM for medical text classification. The model combines the characteristics of CNN, Multi-Head Attention and Bidirectional LSTM to capture local potential features, contextual information and contribution of each feature to the classification. We conduct numerical simulations using real dataset to verify the validation of the model. The results show that the proposed model achieves a performance with accuracy of 91.99% and F1-score of 92.03%, which outperforms some typical methods for text classification.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to memory loss and impairment, which may cause further symptoms. It affects lives of patients seriously and is not curable, but early confirmation of AD may be helpful to start proper treatment so as to avoid further brain damage. Over the past decades, machine learning methods have been applied to the classification of AD with results based on manually prepared features and a classifier having a multiple-step architecture. Recently, with the development of deep learning, the end to- end process of neural networks has been employed for pattern classification. In this paper, we focus on early diagnosis of AD based on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) by using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Image slices of gray matter and white matter from MRI have been used as the inputs for classification. Ensemble learning methods have been employed after the convolutional operations for improving the classification by combining outputs of deep learning classifiers [27]. Three base ConvNets were designed, implemented, and compared in this paper. Our method was evaluated based on a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for the early diagnosis of this illness. In particular, the accuracy rates of our classifications have reached up to 97.65% for AD/mild cognitive impairment and 88.37% for mild cognitive impairment/normal control.},

abstract = {Deep learning has shown a great promise in classifying brain disorders due to its powerful ability in learning optimal features by nonlinear transformation. However, given the high-dimension property of neuroimaging data, how to jointly exploit complementary information from multimodal neuroimaging data in deep learning is difficult. In this paper, we propose a novel multilevel convolutional neural network (CNN) fusion method that can effectively combine different types of neuroimage-derived features. Importantly, we incorporate a sequential feature selection into the CNN model to increase the feature interpretability. To evaluate our method, we classified two symptom-related brain disorders using large-sample multi-site data from 335 schizophrenia (SZ) patients and 380 autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients within a cross-validation procedure. Brain functional networks, functional network connectivity, and brain structural morphology were employed to provide possible features. As expected, our fusion method outperformed the CNN model using only single type of features, as our method yielded higher classification accuracy (with mean accuracy &gt;85%) and was more reliable across multiple runs in differentiating the two groups. We found that the default mode, cognitive control, and subcortical regions contributed more in their distinction. Taken together, our method provides an effective means to fuse multimodal features for the diagnosis of different psychiatric and neurological disorders.},

abstract = {Background: Although the appearance of the brain shows one unique organism, the brain is composed of cognitive regions. Each region can represent some specific function in the brain. The study of the brain's morphology is important to identify changes in the regions and the segmentation process can classify those regions. Several studies conducted on the brain have been using templates, maps and probabilistic models to segment its regions. Method: In this paper, was used a Deep Learning method to segment the Harvard-Oxford atlas as regions of interest. This Atlas presents specific regions that cover the 48 parcellations of the cortical structural areas of the brain. We used a dataset of MRI images from the ADNI 1 database. A collection of 75,402 images was obtained for training and a validation test. Aims: The main goal of this study is to generate an automatic segmentation of the Harvard-Oxford Atlas using SegNet model. Results: it showed a validation DICE of 0.9499, this is a comparative index mostly widely employed with respect to segmentation. Conclusions: The SegNet Model, which was built to segment external scenarios of day by day life, here was able to produce MRI images segmentation, even considering its complexity.},

abstract = {Computerized healthcare has undergone rapid development thanks to the advances in medical imaging and machine learning technologies. Especially, recent progress on deep learning opens a new era for multimedia based clinical decision support. In this paper, we use deep learning with brain network and clinical relevant text information to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease AD. The clinical relevant text information includes age, gender, and $ApoE$ gene of the subject. The brain network is constructed by computing the functional connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging R-fMRI data. A targeted autoencoder network is built to distinguish normal aging from mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of AD. The proposed method reveals discriminative brain network features effectively and provides a reliable classifier for AD detection. Compared to traditional classifiers based on R-fMRI time series data, about 31.21 percent improvement of the prediction accuracy is achieved by the proposed deep learning method, and the standard deviation reduces by 51.23 percent in the best case that means our prediction model is more stable and reliable compared to the traditional methods. Our work excavates deep learning's advantages of classifying high-dimensional multimedia data in medical services, and could help predict and prevent AD at an early stage.},

We design a deep CNN architecture for automated sleep stage classiffication of human sleep EEG and EOG signals. The CNN proposed in this paper amply outperforms recent work that uses a different CNN architecture over a single-EEG-channel version of the same dataset. We show that the performance gains achieved by our network rely mainly on network depth, and not on the use of several signal channels. Performance of our approach is on par with human expert inter-scorer agreement. By examining the internal activation levels of our CNN, we find that it spontaneously discovers signal features such as sleep spindles and slow waves that figure prominently in sleep stage categorization as performed by human experts.},

We present a framework coalescing multiple deep methods and corresponding models as responses to specific Big Data challenges. First, we perform a detailed per-challenge review of existing techniques, with benchmarks and usage advice, and subsequently synthesize them together into one organic construct that we discover principally uses extensions of one underlying model, the autoencoder. This work therefore provides a synthesis where challenges at scale across the Vs of Big Data could be addressed by new algorithms and architectures being proposed in the deep learning community. The value being proposed to the reader from either community in terms of nomenclature, concepts, and techniques of the other would advance the cause of multi-disciplinary, transversal research and accelerate the advance of technology in both domains.},

abstract = {Multi-modality data are widely used in clinical applications, such as tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. Different modalities can usually provide complementary information, which commonly leads to improved performance. However, some modalities are commonly missing for some subjects due to various technical and practical reasons. As a result, multi-modality data are usually incomplete, raising the multi-modality missing data completion problem. In this work, we formulate the problem as a conditional image generation task and propose an encoder-decoder deep neural network to tackle this problem. Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality images. At the same time, we propose to incorporate the available category information of subjects in training to enable the model to generate more informative images. We evaluate our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative~(ADNI) database, where positron emission tomography~(PET) modalities are missing. Experimental results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging~(MRI) modalities, and provide complementary information to improve the detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease. Our results also show that the proposed methods generate higher quality images than baseline methods as measured by various image quality statistics.},

So far, most research focused on the optimisation of the enrolment and authentication, and it was claimed that the EEG has many advantages. However, it was never assessed whether the biometric templates obtained from the EEG contain sensitive information about the enrolled users. In this work we ask whether we can infer personal characteristics such as age, sex, or informations about neurological disorders from these templates.  To this end, we extracted a set of 16 feature vectors from EEG epochs from a sample of 60 healthy subjects and neurological patients. One of these features was the classical power spectrum, while the other 15 features were derived from a multivariate autoregressive model, considering also interdependencies of EEG channels. We classified the sample by sex, neurological diagnoses, age, atrophy of the brain, and intake of neurological drugs. We obtained classification accuracies of up to .70 for sex, .86 for the classification of epilepsy vs. other populations, .81 for the differentiation of young vs. old people's templates, and .82 for the intake of medication targeted to the central nervous system. These informations represent privacy sensitive information about the users, so that our results emphasise the need to apply protective safeguards in the deployment of EEG biometric systems.},

At the same time, the rapid fluctuations between the adjacent sleep stages make it difficult to extract features, resulting in an inaccurate classification of a period of electroencephalogram (EEG) sleep. In order to solve the above problems, this paper proposes a sleep stage classification method based on convolutional neural network and long-term short-term memory network (CNN-LSTM). The method applies CNN to extract spatial features from the original data and LSTM to extract temporal features and adopt softmax to classify these features. To verify the proposed method, we tested it on a public data set called ISRUC-Sleep and compared it with several state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that the proposed method significantly improves the accuracy of sleep staging and achieves better results.},

abstract = {Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurogenerative disorder that undergoes progressive decline in memory and cognitive function and is characterized by structural brain Magnetic Resonance Images (sMRI). In recent years, sMRI data has played a vital role in the evaluation of brain anatomical changes, leading to early detection of AD through deep networks. The existing AD problems such as preprocessing complexity and unreliability are major concerns at present. To overcome these, a model (FEESCTL) has been proposed with an entropy slicing for feature extraction and Transfer Learning for classification. In the present study, the entropy image slicing method is attempted for selecting the most informative MRI slices during training stages. The ADNI dataset is trained on Transfer Learning adopted by VGG-16 network for classifying the AD with normal individuals. The experimental results reveal that the proposed model has achieved an accuracy level of 93.05%, 86.39%, 92.00% for binary classifications (AD/MCI, MCI/CN, AD/CN) and 93.12% for ternary classification (AD/MCI/CN), respectively, and henceforth the efficiency in diagnosing AD is proved through comparative analysis.},

abstract = {This article proposes an approach to select EEG channels based on EEG shapelet transformation, aiming to reduce the setup time and inconvenience for subjects and to improve the applicable performance of Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). In detail, the method selects top-k EEG channels by solving a logistic loss-embedded minimization problem with respect to EEG shapelet learning, hyperplane learning, and EEG channel weight learning simultaneously. Especially, to learn distinguished EEG shapelets for weighting contributions of each EEG channel to the logistic loss, EEG shapelet similarity is also minimized during the procedure. Furthermore, the gradient descent strategy is adopted in the article to solve the non-convex optimization problem, which finally leads to the algorithm termed StEEGCS. In a result, classification accuracy, with those EEG channels selected by StEEGCS, is improved compared to that with all EEG channels, and classification time consumption is reduced as well. Additionally, the comparisons with several state-of-the-art EEG channel selection methods on several real-world EEG datasets also demonstrate the efficacy and superiority of StEEGCS.},

Going beyond this common limitation, in this paper, we exploit the Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal to effectively come up with a portable Parkinson’s disease diagnosis system that can go in-the-wild. To do so, we collect EEG signals from both Parkinson’s patients and healthy people in different emotional states. Our statistical analysis finds a substantial differences in the signals in several emotional states for Parkinson’s patients and healthy people.

abstract = {Research on Alzheimer's Disease auxiliary diagnosis based on deep learning has been receiving more and more attention. However, in existing AD classification research based on T1-weighted structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging, the influence of different MRI scanning modes (i.e., 1.5T and 3T) of ADNI database is not well considered. In addition, there are few attempts to use the Voxel-Based Morphometry-Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponential Lie algebra method for data preprocessing in AD classification experiments. Therefore, the VBM-DARTEL method is used to preprocess the sMRI data. Then, based on different scanning methods, the preprocessed ADNI subsets are further divided according to three data partitioning methods (subject, MRI and visit-history), on which five representative convolutional neural networks are adopted for classification and evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that the overall classification performance on both 1.5T and 3T datasets is visit-history&gt;MRI&gt;subject. Meanwhile, the best accuracy rates 95.87% and 97.15% are achieved by GoogLeNet on 1.5T and 3T datasets in visit-history level. In addition, preprocessing operation improves the accuracy rate of AD classification to a certain extent and the performance of the five CNN models is equivalent in preprocessed datasets, while there is obviously accuracy difference on none-preprocessed datasets.},

To develop an adaptive system that can accommodate the lack of expertise, the system needs to classify the expertise level. In this paper, we have presented a method to estimate the cognitive activity of the novice and expert user in the 3D modelling environment. The method has the capability of predicting novice and expert users. Normalized Transfer Entropy (NTE) of Electroencephalography (EEG) was used as a connectivity measure to calculate the information flow between the EEG electrodes. Functional brain networks (FBNs) were created from the NTE matrix and graph theory was used to analyze the complex network. The results from graph theory-based measures showed that there were significant differences between novice and expert user's information flow patterns. The results showed that a classification accuracy of above 90% was achieved with a simple k-NN classifier and 5 features. From the feature selection method, we found that the most important EEG electrodes that contribute maximum towards classification were the frontal lobe electrodes. The classification results show that the proposed algorithm can effectively predict the novice and expert users in real-time.},

Over the past 40 years, many BCI applications have been developed in a variety of domains, from entertainment to medical field and even to computer security mechanisms. Until now, the development of BCI systems has focused on improving their accuracy, functionality, and ease of use, and not enough effort and attention has been invested in securing these systems and the sensitive data they acquire. In this article, we present the principles of brain activity data acquisition, with a special focus on EEG, and we present a taxonomy of BCI applications and domains. We also provide a comprehensive survey that covers eight possible attacks aimed at BCI systems. For each BCI application, we created an ecosystem and data and attack flow-diagram, which comprehensively describes the roles and interactions of the players associated with the BCI application and presents the most vulnerable vectors and components within its ecosystem; we identified gaps between existing security solutions and the presented attacks and vulnerabilities. Finally, we provide several concrete suggestions for improving the security of BCI systems in cyber-space.},

VisIRR effectively combines the paradigms of (1) a passive pull through query processes for retrieval and (2) an active push that recommends items of potential interest to users based on their preferences. Equipped with an efficient dynamic query interface against a large-scale corpus, VisIRR organizes the retrieved documents into high-level topics and visualizes them in a 2D space, representing the relationships among the topics along with their keyword summary. In addition, based on interactive personalized preference feedback with regard to documents, VisIRR provides document recommendations from the entire corpus, which are beyond the retrieved sets. Such recommended documents are visualized in the same space as the retrieved documents, so that users can seamlessly analyze both existing and newly recommended ones. This article presents novel computational methods, which make these integrated representations and fast interactions possible for a large-scale document corpus. We illustrate how the system works by providing detailed usage scenarios. Additionally, we present preliminary user study results for evaluating the effectiveness of the system.},

In this work, we first adopted the RevGAN model to complete missing data. After that, a 3D convolutional neural network was designed to perform AD diagnosis by all subjects (with both real images and synthetic PET images). We tested our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

Importantly, traditional selection methods are not able to select valid EEG signals for different classifiers. This article focuses on a source control-based valid EEG selection to reduce the impact of invalid EEG signals and aims to improve EEG-based classification performance for different classifiers. We propose a novel centroid-based EEG selection approach named CenEEGs, which uses a scale-and-shift-invariance similarity metric to measure similarities of EEG signals and then applies a globally optimal centroid strategy to select valid EEG signals with respect to a similarity threshold. A detailed comparison with several state-of-the-art time series selection methods by using standard criteria on 8 EEG datasets demonstrates the efficacy and superiority of CenEEGs for different classifiers.},

abstract = {In the medical imaging domain, non-linear warping has enabled pixel by pixel mapping of one image dataset to a reference dataset. This co-registration of data allows for robust, pixel-wise, statistical maps to be developed in the domain, leading to new insights regarding disease mechanisms [20]. Deep learning technologies have given way to some impressive discoveries. In some applications, deep learning algorithms have surpassed the abilities of human image readers to classify data. As long as endpoints are clearly defined, and the input data volume is large enough, deep learning networks can often converge and reach prediction, classification, and segmentation with success rates as high or higher than human operators [13]. However, machine learning, and deep learning algorithms are complex and interpretability is not always a straightforward byproduct of the classification performed. Visualization techniques have been developed to add a layer of interpretability. The work presented here compares a simplified machine learning workflow for medical imaging to a statistical map from a previous study to validate that the machine learning model used does indeed focus its attention on known important regions.},

This paper proposes a dynamic calibration algorithm which presents promising results for subject-independent human emotion recognition. The goal of the calibration module is to calibrate itself with respect to the features of a new subject by finding the most similar subject in the training data. In order to check the overall performance, this approach is tested using the well-known MAHNOB dataset.

abstract = {Epilepsy is a common neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures accompanied by excessive synchronous brain activity. The process of structural and functional brain alterations leading to increased seizure susceptibility and eventually spontaneous seizures is called epileptogenesis (EPG) and can span months or even years. Detecting and monitoring the progression of EPG could allow for targeted early interventions that could slow down disease progression or even halt its development. Here, we propose an approach for staging EPG using deep neural networks and identify potential electroencephalography (EEG) biomarkers to distinguish different phases of EPG. Specifically, continuous intracranial EEG recordings were collected from a rodent model where epilepsy is induced by electrical perforant pathway stimulation (PPS). A deep neural network (DNN) is trained to distinguish EEG signals from before stimulation (baseline), shortly after the PPS and long after the PPS but before the first spontaneous seizure (FSS). Experimental results show that our proposed method can classify EEG signals from the three phases with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.93, 0.89, and 0.86. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first successful attempt to stage EPG prior to the FSS using DNNs.},

abstract = {State-of-the-art techniques for detecting, or predicting, neurological disorders (1) focus on predicting each disorder individually, and are (2) computationally expensive, leading to a delay that can potentially render the prediction useless, especially in critical events. Towards this, we present a real-time two-tiered framework called EMAP, which cross-correlates the input with all the EEG signals in our mega-database (a combination of multiple EEG datasets) at the cloud, while tracking the signal in real-time at the edge, to predict the occurrence of a neurological anomaly. Using the proposed framework, we have demonstrated a prediction accuracy of up to 94% for the three different anomalies that we have tested.},

abstract = {Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) negatively influences a person's ability to cope and increases psychiatric morbidity. The existing diagnostic tools of PTSD are often difficult to administer within marginalized communities due to language and cultural barriers, lack of skilled clinicians, and stigma around disclosing traumatic experiences. We present an initial proof of concept for a novel, low-cost, and creative method to screen the potential cases of PTSD based on free-hand sketches within three different communities in Bangladesh: Rohingya refugees (n = 44), slum-dwellers (n = 35), and engineering students (n = 85). Due to the low overhead and nonverbal nature of sketching, our proposed method potentially overcomes communication and resource barriers. Using corner and edge detection algorithms, we extracted three features (number of corners, number and average length of strokes) from the images of free-hand sketches. We used these features along with sketch themes, participants' gender and group to train multiple logistic regression models for potentially screening PTSD (accuracy: 82.9-87.9%). We improved the accuracy (99.29%) by integrating EEG data with sketch features in a Random Forest model for the refugee population. Our proposed initial assessment method of PTSD based on sketches could potentially be integrated with phones and EEG headsets, making it widely accessible to the underrepresented communities.},

abstract = {Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is of great importance to the benefits of AD patients, including lessening symptoms and alleviating the financial burden of health care. As one of the leading signs of AD, changes of language capability can potentially be used for early diagnosis of AD. In this paper, I develop an automatic and accurate diagnostic model by using the linguistic characteristics of the subjects and hybrid word embedding. I detected linguistic features such as pauses, unintelligible words, repetitions, etc. from transcripts of interviews. Then I create a text embedding by combining word vectors from Doc2vec and ELMo. Moreover, by tuning hyperparameters of the machine learning pipeline (e.g., model regularization parameter, learning rate and vector size of Doc2vec, and vector size of ELMo), I achieve 91% classification accuracy and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 97% for distinguishing early AD from healthy subjects. Compared with the method which only uses word count, I improved the absolute detection accuracy by 10%, and the absolute AUC by 9%. Moreover, I study the stability of the model by repeating experiment and find out that the model is stable even though my training data is split randomly. My algorithms have high detection accuracy and are stable. This model could be used as a large-scale screening method for AD, as well as a complement to doctors’ detection of AD.},

abstract = {Due to the increasing popularity of mobile devices, the usage of lifelogging has dramatically expanded. People collect their daily memorial moments and share with friends on the social network, which is an emerging lifestyle. We see great potential of lifelogging applications along with rapid recent growth of the wearables market, where more sensors are introduced to wearables, i.e., electroencephalogram (EEG) sensors, that can further sense the user’s mental activities, e.g., emotions. In this article, we present the design and implementation of Memento, an emotion-driven lifelogging system on wearables. Memento integrates EEG sensors with smart glasses. Since memorable moments usually coincides with the user’s emotional changes, Memento leverages the knowledge from the brain-computer-interface domain to analyze the EEG signals to infer emotions and automatically launch lifelogging based on that. Towards building Memento on Commercial off-the-shelf wearable devices, we study EEG signals in mobility cases and propose a multiple sensor fusion based approach to estimate signal quality. We present a customized two-phase emotion recognition architecture, considering both the affordability and efficiency of wearable-class devices. We also discuss the optimization framework to automatically choose and configure the suitable lifelogging method (video, audio, or image) by analyzing the environment and system context. Finally, our experimental evaluation shows that Memento is responsive, efficient, and user-friendly on wearables.},

abstract = {The content of this handbook is most appropriate for graduate students and of primary interest to students studying computer science and information technology, human-computer interfaces, mobile and ubiquitous interfaces, affective and behavioral computing, machine learning, and related multidisciplinary majors. When teaching graduate classes with this book, whether in a quarter- or semester-long course, we recommend initially requiring that students spend two weeks reading the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces (Morgan &amp; Claypool Publishers, Human-Centered Interfaces Synthesis Series, 2015). With this orientation, a graduate class providing an overview of multimodal-multisensor interfaces then could select chapters from the current handbook, distributed across topics in the different sections.As an example, in a 10-week course the remaining 8 weeks might be allocated to reading select chapters on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations (2 weeks); (2) prototyping and software tools, signal processing, and architectures (2 weeks); (3) language and dialogue processing (1 week); (4) detection of emotional and cognitive state (2 weeks); and (5) commercialization, future trends, and societal issues (1 week). In a more extended 16-week course, we recommend spending an additional week reading and discussing chapters on each of these five topic areas, as well as an additional week on the introductory textbook, The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces. As an alternative, in a semester-long course in which students will be conducting a project in one target area (e.g., designing multimodal dialogue systems for in-vehicle use), some or all of the additional time in the semester course could be spent: (1) reading a more in-depth collection of handbook chapters on language and dialogue processing (e.g., 2 weeks) and (2) conducting the hands-on project (e.g., 4 weeks).For more tailored versions of a course on multimodal-multisensor interfaces, another approach is to have students read the handbook chapters in relevant sections and then follow up with more targeted and in-depth technical papers. For example, a course intended for a cognitive science audience might start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters from the handbook sections on: (1) theory, user modeling, and common modality combinations; (2) multimodal processing of social and emotional information; and (3) multimodal processing of cognition and mental health status. Afterward, the course could teach students different computational and statistical analysis techniques related to these chapters, ideally through demonstration. Students might then be asked to conduct a hands-on project in which they apply one or more analysis methods to multimodal data to build user models or predict mental states.As a second example, a course intended for a computer science audience might also start by reading The Paradigm Shift to Multimodality in Contemporary Interfaces, followed by assigning chapters on: (1) prototyping and software tools; (2) multimodal signal processing and architectures; and (3) language and dialogue processing. Afterward, students might engage in a hands-on project in which they design, build, and evaluate the performance of a multimodal system.In all of these teaching scenarios, we anticipate that professors will find this handbook to be a particularly comprehensive and valuable current resource for teaching about multimodal-multisensor interfaces.AcknowledgmentsIn the present age, reviewers are one of the most precious commodities on earth.

The architecture of the system features sensors to measure the brain potential, localized data analysis and filtering, and in-cloud distribution to specialized medical personnel. As such, it presents tradeoffs typical of other cyber-physical systems, where hardware, algorithms, and software implementations have to come together in a coherent fashion. The system is based on spatio-temporal detection and characterization of a specific brain potential called P300. The diagnosis of cognitive deficit is achieved by analyzing the data collected by the system with a new algorithm called tuned-Residue Iteration Decomposition (t-RIDE). The system has been tested on 17 subjects (n = 12 healthy, n = 3 mildly cognitive impaired, and n = 2 with Alzheimer's disease involved in three different cognitive tasks with increasing difficulty. The system allows fast diagnosis of cognitive deficit, including mild and heavy cognitive impairment: t-RIDE convergence is achieved in 79 iterations (i.e., 1.95s), yielding an 80% accuracy in P300 amplitude evaluation with only 13 trials on a single EEG channel.},

Then a new feature selection method combining the support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), maximal-relevance-minimal-redundancy (mRMR) and random forest (RF) was proposed to select the optimal subsets among all these features. Finally, the SVM classifier was used for AD/MCI/NC classification by 10-fold cross-validation. We applied the proposed method to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, and the experimental results show a high degree of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, which are superior to some other state-of-the-art approaches.},

abstract = {Assessment of apathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) relies heavily on interviews with caregivers and patients, which can be ambiguous and time consuming. More precise and objective methods of evaluation can better inform treatment decisions. In this study, visual scanning behaviours (VSBs) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli were used to detect apathy in patients with AD. Forty-eight AD patients participated in the study. Sixteen of the patients were apathetic. Patients looked at 48 slides with non-emotional images and 32 slides with emotional images. We described two methods that use recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn differences between the VSBs of apathetic and non-apathetic AD patients. Method 1 uses two separate RNNs to learn group differences between visual scanning sequences on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The outputs of the RNNs are then combined and used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Method 1 achieved an AUC gain of 0.074 compared to a previously presented handcrafted feature method of detecting emotional blunting (AUC handcrafted = 0.646). Method 2 assumes that each individual's "style of scanning" (stereotypical eye movements) is independent of the content of the visual stimuli and uses the "style of scanning" to normalise the individual's VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. Method 2 uses RNNs in a sequence-to-sequence configuration to learn the individual's "style of scanning". The trained model is then used to create vector representations that contain information on the individual's "style of scanning" (content independent) and her/his VSBs (content dependent) on emotional and non-emotional stimuli. The distance between these vector representations is used by a logistic regression classifier to characterise patients as either apathetic or non-apathetic. Using Method 2 the AUC of the classifier improved to 0.814. The results presented suggest that using RNNs to analyse differences between VSBs on emotional and non-emotional stimuli (a measure of emotional blunting) can improve objective detection of apathy in individual patients with AD.},

abstract = {Calcium (Ca2+) is a vital and very important cation for proper functioning of the nerve cells. There is abundant amount of Ca2+ in human nerve cells among them very few amount lies in the cytosol in the form of free Ca2+. These free amounts of Ca2+ react with calbindin-D28k which works as buffer species and significantly lower down the intracellular Ca2+ concentration. Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder of the human nerve cells associated with alteration in Ca2+ signalling process. In present study an attempt has been made by considering fractional advection diffusion equation to study the effect of buffer on Ca2+ diffusion in Parkinsonic nerve cells. An appropriate initial and boundary condition is taken according to the physiology of the problem. Analytical solution is obtained corresponding to time fractional advection diffusion equation and space fractional advection diffusion equation. The obtained results are simulated in MATLAB and interpreted with the Ca2+ distribution in nerve cells.},

abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) provides a way to develop interaction between a brain and a computer. The communication is developed as a result of neural responses generated in the brain because of motor movements or cognitive activities. The means of communication here includes muscular and non-muscular actions. These actions generate brain activities or brain waves that are directed to a hardware device to perform a specific task. BCI initially was developed as the communication device for patients suffering from neuromuscular disorders. Owing to recent advancements in BCI devices—such as passive electrodes, wireless headsets, adaptive software, and decreased costs—it is also being used for developing communication between the general public. The BCI device records brain responses using various invasive and non-invasive acquisition techniques such as electrocorticography (ECoG), electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this article, a survey on these techniques has been provided. The brain response needs to be translated using machine learning and pattern recognition methods to control any application. A brief review of various existing feature extraction techniques and classification algorithms applied on data recorded from the brain has been included in this article. A significant comparative analysis of popular existing BCI techniques is presented and possible future directives are provided.},

abstract = {Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) is usually difficult, especially when the disease is in its early stage. However, treatment is most likely to be effective at this stage; bringing an advantage in improving the life of patients, diagnosis process. After years of research, still little is known about its detailed mechanism. The AD patients undergo different physical examinations, brain scans, and laboratory tests etc. that require them to physically visit the medical center multiple times. Such visits further result in each patient's massive data stored for clinical diagnosis. This elevates the possibility of using informative rich variables from this data for the early detection of AD with the help of Machine Learning (ML) techniques. However, the previously proposed models endure a number of limitations which place strong barriers towards the direct applicability of such models for accurate prediction. A number of classifiers have been utilized in the literature but none of the previous work utilized the two major categories of variables namely clinical diagnosis and clinical judgment. In this paper, we utilize these two categories of data and perform a comparative evaluation of the predominant machine learning algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy, precision, recall (AUC) and training time. Our experimental results revealed that Bayesian based classifiers improve AD detection accuracy and allows the meaningful interpretation of predictive model which assists in early prognosis of AD for each patient.},

abstract = {Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, not only imposes a huge financial burden on the health care system, but also a psychological and emotional burden on patients and their families. There is thus an urgent need to infer trajectories of cognitive performance over time and identify biomarkers predictive of the progression. In this article, we propose the multi-task learning with fused Laplacian sparse group lasso model, which can identify biomarkers closely related to cognitive measures due to its sparsity-inducing property, and model the disease progression with a general weighted (undirected) dependency graphs among the tasks. An efficient alternative directions method of multipliers based optimization algorithm is derived to solve the proposed non-smooth objective formulation. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated by its superior prediction performance over multiple state-of-the-art methods and accurate identification of compact sets of cognition-relevant imaging biomarkers that are consistent with prior medical studies.},

However it is not a normal part of aging. It is now threatening public health systems. Countless families are suffering from older members' cognitive decline. Memory loss is typical of the symptoms. Although there are some medications that relieve the symptoms for AD patients, further research on a definitive cure of this disease is still in urgent necessity.

abstract = {The socioeconomic losses caused by extreme daytime drowsiness are enormous in these days. Hence, building a virtuous cycle system is necessary to improve work efficiency and safety by monitoring instantaneous drowsiness that can be used in any environment. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to detect extreme drowsiness using a short time segment (~ 2 s) of EEG which well represents immediate activity changes depending on a person's arousal, drowsiness, and sleep state. To develop the framework, we use multitaper power spectral density (MPSD) for feature extraction along with extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) as a machine learning classifier. In addition, we suggest a novel drowsiness labeling method by combining the advantages of the psychomotor vigilance task and the electrooculography technique. By experimental evaluation, we show that the adopted MPSD and XGB techniques outperform other techniques used in previous studies. Finally, we identify that spectral components (theta, alpha, and gamma) and channels (Fp1, Fp2, T3, T4, O1, and O2) play an important role in our drowsiness detection framework, which could be extended to mobile devices.},

abstract = {Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) are debilitating neurodegenerative disorders affecting one in every ten older Americans. In the United States, roughly 35.6 million Americans have dementia and approximately 5.7 million have Alzheimer's. By 2050, the count is expected to increase to 13.2 million older Americans. Alzheimer's is the top sixth cause of death in the U.S. People with ADRD face substantial challenges adapting to their physical, psychological and social environments. Like cognitively-intact older adults, ADRD persons prefer to age in place in a familiar environment. However, aging in one's own habitat comes with the potential for loneliness, social isolation, and the consequences of impaired mobility that threaten the displacement of ADRD persons to non-preferred living arrangements. The decrease in multi-generational living and increase in nuclear family living calls for innovative solutions to promote safe mobility, independence, decision making and communication for persons with ADRD. Assistive technologies (ATs) if user friendly and properly engineered for persons with ADRD, hold the potential to enhance daily functioning and improve the quality of life for ADRD persons in living habitats of their choices. This review paper aims to discuss existing and emerging AT megatrends in the Internet of things (IoT) era. Five technological megatrends are examined: assistive robots (e.g. assistance in daily activities, social robots for communication, telepresence robots for social connectedness), biometric sensors and movement sensor technologies (IMURs) for gait and walkability (e.g. non-wearable sensors), multimodal interaction systems for early disease detection, augmented reality systems that},

Although some of them adjust well, many suffer from significant psychological distress, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), owing to exposure to traumatic events and hardships. Here, diagnosis and access to psychological health care present particular challenges for various human-centered design issues. Therefore, analyzing the case of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh, we propose a two-way diagnosis of PTSD using (i) short inexpensive questionnaire to determine its prevalence, and (ii) low-cost portable EEG headset to identify potential neurobiological markers of PTSD. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to use consumer-grade EEG devices in the scarce-resource settings of refugees. Moreover, we explored the underlying structure of PTSD and its symptoms via developing various hybrid models based on Bayesian inference by combining aspects from both reflective and formative models of PTSD, which is also the first of its kind. Our findings revealed several key components of PTSD and its neurobiological abnormality. Moreover, challenges faced during our study would inform design processes of screening tools and treatments of PTSD to incorporate refugee experience in a more meaningful way during contemporary and future humanitarian crisis.},

abstract = {Several anatomical magnetic resonance imaging MRI markers for Alzheimer's disease AD have been identified. Cortical gray matter volume, cortical thickness, and subcortical volume have been used successfully to assist the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease including its early warning and developing stages, e.g., mild cognitive impairment MCI including MCI converted to AD MCIc and MCI not converted to AD MCInc. Currently, these anatomical MRI measures have mainly been used separately. Thus, the full potential of anatomical MRI scans for AD diagnosis might not yet have been used optimally. Meanwhile, most studies currently only focused on morphological features of regions of interest ROIs or interregional features without considering the combination of them. To further improve the diagnosis of AD, we propose a novel approach of extracting ROI features and interregional features based on multiple measures from MRI images to distinguish AD, MCI including MCIc and MCInc, and health control HC. First, we construct six individual networks based on six different anatomical measures i.e., CGMV, CT, CSA, CC, CFI, and SV and Automated Anatomical Labeling AAL atlas for each subject. Then, for each individual network, we extract all node ROI features and edge interregional features, and denoted as node feature set and edge feature set, respectively. Therefore, we can obtain six node feature sets and six edge feature sets from six different anatomical measures. Next, each feature within a feature set is ranked by $F$-score in descending order, and the top ranked features of each feature set are applied to MKBoost algorithm to obtain the best classification accuracy. After obtaining the best classification accuracy, we can get the optimal feature subset and the corresponding classifier for each node or edge feature set. Afterwards, to investigate the classification performance with only node features, we proposed a weighted multiple kernel learning wMKL framework to combine these six optimal node feature subsets, and obtain a combined classifier to perform AD classification. Similarly, we can obtain the classification performance with only edge features. Finally, we combine both six optimal node feature subsets and six optimal edge feature subsets to further improve the classification performance. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms some state-of-the-art methods in AD classification, and demonstrate that different measures contain complementary information.},

However, if early intervention is taken, PTSD can be well prevented or delayed. This paper proposes a machine learning method associated with multiple atlases upon the multi-modal structural MRI images to predict high-risk patients with PTSD. Specifically, 72 participants underwent T1 and DTI scans within 48 hours after suffering traffic accidents. Thirty-two subjects were eventually diagnosed with PTSD. We first extracted T1 and DTI features within the regions-of-interest (ROIs) parcellated by multiple atlases. Those features were then fed into feature selection and classification to build an optimal model through which we can predict whether a new trauma-exposed subject would develop into PTSD. Our results demonstrated high performance (AUC: 0.8484, ACC: 0.8750), indicating the proposed method can produce an accurate and robust prediction of PTSD.},

abstract = {The Handbook of Multimodal-Multisensor Interfaces provides the first authoritative resource on what has become the dominant paradigm for new computer interfaces---user input involving new media (speech, multi-touch, hand and body gestures, facial expressions, writing) embedded in multimodal-multisensor interfaces.This three-volume handbook is written by international experts and pioneers in the field. It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.}

In previous work several methodologies of attention analytics were developed with laboratory based eye tracking technology but there is still a lack in providing opportunity for pervasive and continuous tracking of mental state for people still living at home. This work proposes a playful cognitive assessment method based on the antisaccade task. The performance scores of the serious game were analyzed in a field trial with 15 participants being diagnosed with light degree of Alzheimer's disease within a period of 10 weeks. The results present a statistically significant correlation between the game outcome scores and the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) score, the golden standard for the analysis of executive functions in early Alzheimer's disease. This indicates first successful steps towards the daily use of serious games for pervasive assessment of Alzheimer's mental state.},

abstract = {Sensing and machine learning advances have enabled the unobtrusive measurement of physiological responses and facial expressions so as to estimate one's cognitive performance. This often boils down to mapping the states of the cognitive processes underpinning human cognition: physiological responses (e.g., heart rate) and facial expressions (e.g., frowning) often reflect the states of our cognitive processes. However, it remains unclear whether physiological responses and facial expressions used in one particular task (e.g., gaming) can reliably assess cognitive performance in another task (e.g., coding), because complex and diverse tasks often require varying levels and combinations of cognitive processes. In this paper, we measure the cross-task reliability of physiological and facial responses. Specifically, we assess cognitive performance based on physiological responses and facial expressions for 123 participants in 4 independent studies (3 studies for out-of-sampling training and testing, and 1 study for evaluation only): (1) a Pac-Man game, (2) an adaptive-assessment task, (3) a code-debugging task, and (4) a gaze-based game. We follow an ensemble learning approach after cross-training and cross-testing with all possible combinations of the 3 first datasets. We save the 4th dataset only for testing purposes, and we showcase how to engineer generalizable features that predict cognitive performance. Our results show that the extracted features do generalize, and can reliably predict cognitive performance across a diverse set of cognitive tasks that require different combinations of problem-solving, decision-making, and learning processes for their completion.},

PET imaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are potential diagnostic biomarkers. In this work, we performed GWAS and a novel linear regression method on 10 neuroimaging quantitative traits(Qts) included AV-45 PET data of frontal, cingulate, parietal, temporal regions, entire cortical, and CSF levels of A\ss{}42, T-tau, T-tau/A\ss{}42, P-tau, P-tau/A\ss{}42 data using a sample of 667 subjects from the ADNI database. As we expected, the most significant loci, APOE, APOC1, TOMM40 genes were replicated in our GWAS. Additive linear regression model for SNP-SNP interaction detecting considered age, gender, and clinical diagnosis as covariates. 337 of SNPs showed statistically significant interaction effects on the T-tau/A\ss{}42 level (Bonferroni-corrected p-value &lt;0.05). And few significant variants were identified in other 9 phenotypes. It indicated that linear regression method can be used to detect susceptibility of quantitative traits and identify novel AD risk loci.},

abstract = {Studies of the human brain network are becoming increasingly popular in the fields of neuroscience, computer science, and neurology. Despite this rapidly growing line of research, gaps remain on the intersection of data analytics, interactive visual representation, and the human intelligence—all needed to advance our understanding of human brain networks. This article tackles this challenge by exploring the design space of visual analytics. We propose an integrated framework to orchestrate computational models with comprehensive data visualizations on the human brain network. The framework targets two fundamental tasks: the visual exploration of multi-label brain networks and the visual comparison among brain networks across different subject groups. During the first task, we propose a novel interactive user interface to visualize sets of labeled brain networks; in our second task, we introduce sparse regression models to select discriminative features from the brain network to facilitate the comparison. Through user studies and quantitative experiments, both methods are shown to greatly improve the visual comparison performance. Finally, real-world case studies with domain experts demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of our framework to analyze reconstructions of human brain connectivity maps. The perceptually optimized visualization design and the feature selection model calibration are shown to be the key to our significant findings.},

LBD is a knowledge discovery workflow that automatically detects significant, implicit knowledge associations hidden in fragmented knowledge areas by analysing existing scientific literature. Therefore, the LBD output not only assists in formulating scientifically sensible, novel research hypotheses but also encourages the development of cross-disciplinary research. In this systematic review, we provide an in-depth analysis of the computational techniques used in the LBD process using a novel, up-to-date, and detailed classification. Moreover, we also summarise the key milestones of the discipline through a timeline of topics. To provide a general overview of the discipline, the review outlines LBD validation checks, major LBD tools, application areas, domains, and generalisability of LBD methodologies. We also outline the insights gathered through our statistical analysis that capture the trends in LBD literature. To conclude, we discuss the prevailing research deficiencies in the discipline by highlighting the challenges and opportunities of future LBD research.},

In the process of the analysis, lesion markers and matches were primarily assessed by experts, which was time-consuming and limited the analysis of WMH or related symptoms for large number of whole brain images. In this study, we proposed a systematic procedure based on high order Zernike transform to align the images of one subject at different scan times. To estimate the rotation angle between the aligned images, we extract the keypoints and their corresponding features from the images based on Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to. Then, the matching white matter hyperintensities in the pre and post stages is performed after all the post images are rotated and translated to the coordinates of the first scan image.},

abstract = {Intelligent Computing for Interactive System Design provides a comprehensive resource on what has become the dominant paradigm in designing novel interaction methods, involving gestures, speech, text, touch and brain-controlled interaction, embedded in innovative and emerging human–computer interfaces. These interfaces support ubiquitous interaction with applications and services running on smartphones, wearables, in-vehicle systems, virtual and augmented reality, robotic systems, the Internet of Things (IoT), and many other domains that are now highly competitive, both in commercial and in research contexts.This book presents the crucial theoretical foundations needed by any student, researcher, or practitioner working on novel interface design, with chapters on statistical methods, digital signal processing (DSP), and machine learning (ML). These foundations are followed by chapters that discuss case studies on smart cities, brain–computer interfaces, probabilistic mobile text entry, secure gestures, personal context from mobile phones, adaptive touch interfaces, and automotive user interfaces. The case studies chapters also highlight an in-depth look at the practical application of DSP and ML methods used for processing of touch, gesture, biometric, or embedded sensor inputs. A common theme throughout the case studies is ubiquitous support for humans in their daily professional or personal activities.In addition, the book provides walk-through examples of different DSP and ML techniques and their use in interactive systems. Common terms are defined, and information on practical resources is provided (e.g., software tools, data resources) for hands-on project work to develop and evaluate multimodal and multi-sensor systems. In a series of short additions to each chapter, an expert on the legal and ethical issues explores the emergent deep concerns of the professional community, on how DSP and ML should be adopted and used in socially appropriate ways, to most effectively advance human performance during ubiquitous interaction with omnipresent computers.This carefully edited collection is written by international experts and pioneers in the fields of DSP and ML. It provides a textbook for students and a reference and technology roadmap for developers and professionals working on interaction design on emerging platforms.}

abstract = {Before last two decades, astrocytes were treated as supporting cells of neuron. Now it is regarded as important and strong participant in central nervous system. Astrocytes also play important role in many neuronal disorders like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's etc. Astrocytes release gliotransmitters like glutamate. Astrocytes take part in synapse in calcium dependent manner. However, it is not clear about the effect of astrocyte geometry on calcium distribution. In this study we present a geometry based mathematical model of an astrocytes. Mathematical model is developed in the form of reaction diffusion equation by considering the effect of endogenous and exogenous buffers on cytosolic calcium concentration. In present study it is concluded that the effect of geometry also visible and found significant on cytosolic calcium distribution in astrocytes.},

abstract = {Detection of aesthetic highlights is a challenge for understanding the affective processes taking place during movie watching. In this article, we study spectators’ responses to movie aesthetic stimuli in a social context. Moreover, we look for uncovering the emotional component of aesthetic highlights in movies. Our assumption is that synchronized spectators’ physiological and behavioral reactions occur during these highlights because: (i) aesthetic choices of filmmakers are made to elicit specific emotional reactions (e.g., special effects, empathy, and compassion toward a character) and (ii) watching a movie together causes spectators’ affective reactions to be synchronized through emotional contagion. We compare different approaches to estimation of synchronization among multiple spectators’ signals, such as pairwise, group, and overall synchronization measures to detect aesthetic highlights in movies. The results show that the unsupervised architecture relying on synchronization measures is able to capture different properties of spectators’ synchronization and detect aesthetic highlights based on both spectators’ electrodermal and acceleration signals. We discover that pairwise synchronization measures perform the most accurately independently of the category of the highlights and movie genres. Moreover, we observe that electrodermal signals have more discriminative power than acceleration signals for highlight detection.},

abstract = {Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is one of the most common brain disorders among children. This disorder is considered as a big threat for public health and causes attention, focus and organizing difficulties for children and even adults. Since the cause of ADHD is not known yet, data mining algorithms are being used to help discover patterns which discriminate healthy from ADHD subjects. Numerous efforts are underway with the goal of developing classification tools for ADHD diagnosis based on functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging data of the brain. In this paper, we used Eros, which is a technique for computing similarity between two multivariate time series along with k-Nearest-Neighbor classifier, to classify healthy vs ADHD children. We designed a model selection scheme called J-Eros which is able to pick the optimum value of k for k-Nearest-Neighbor from the training data. We applied this technique to the public data provided by ADHD-200 Consortium competition and our results show that J-Eros is capable of discriminating healthy from ADHD children such that we outperformed the best results reported by ADHD-200 competition about 20 percent for two datasets.The implemented code is available as GPL license on GitHub portal of our lab at https://github.com/pcdslab/J-Eros.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the calcium signaling phenomena using finite element method in a typical neuron cell. Neuron being the fundamental cell of the brain has many important roles to perform. The approximated geometry of the neuron is considered to approximate the calcium flow in it. Calcium is considered to be the important second messenger which helps in maintaining plethora of functions like synaptogenesis, proliferation, cell differentiation, etc. The level of the cell calcium is maintained by several important physiological parameters of the calcium toolkit like buffers, endoplasmic reticulum, mitochondria, voltage gated calcium channel, etc. Here, we have considered the cytoplasmic calcium binding buffers in knowing its effect on cytosolic calcium concentration. Exogenous buffers EGTA and BAPTA are considered here. Mathematical model involving two-dimensional partial differential equation is used to delineate the calcium diffusion in presence of calcium binding buffers. Appropriate boundary conditions matching with the physiology of the brain are incorporated. To obtain the desired results finite element technique is used. Discretization and further refinement of the mesh is done to obtain more better approximation of the calcium flow. The results obtained here clearly show the significant impact of buffers on calcium diffusion.},

abstract = {Parkinson's disease PD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized clinically by motor dysfunction bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability, and pathologically by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the basal ganglia. Growing literature supports that cognitive deficits may also be present in PD, even in non-demented patients. Gray matter GM atrophy has been reported in PD and may be related to cognitive decline. This study investigated cortical thickness in non-demented PD subjects and elucidated its relationship to cognitive impairment using high-resolution T1-weighted brain MRI and comprehensive cognitive function scores from 71 non-demented PD and 48 control subjects matched for age, gender, and education. Cortical thickness was compared between groups using a flexible hierarchical multivariate Bayesian model, which accounts for correlations between brain regions. Correlation analyses were performed among brain areas and cognitive domains as well, which showed significant group differences in the PD population. Compared to Controls, PD subjects demonstrated significant age-adjusted cortical thinning predominantly in inferior and superior parietal areas and extended to superior frontal, superior temporal, and precuneus areas posterior probability &gt;0.9. Cortical thinning was also found in the left precentral and lateral occipital, and right postcentral, middle frontal, and fusiform regions posterior probability &gt;0.9. PD patients showed significantly reduced cognitive performance in executive function, including set shifting p = 0.005 and spontaneous flexibility p = 0.02, which were associated with the above cortical thinning regions p &lt; 0.05.},

abstract = {Imaging genetics has attracted significant interests in recent studies. Traditional work has focused on mass-univariate statistical approaches that identify important single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with quantitative traits (QTs) of brain structure or function. More recently, to address the problem of multiple comparison and weak detection, multivariate analysis methods such as the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) are often used to select the most relevant SNPs associated with QTs. However, one problem of Lasso, as well as many other feature selection methods for imaging genetics, is that some useful prior information, e.g., the hierarchical structure among SNPs, are rarely used for designing a more powerful model. In this paper, we propose to identify the associations between candidate genetic features (i.e., SNPs) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-derived measures using a tree-guided sparse learning (TGSL) method. The advantage of our method is that it explicitly models the complex hierarchical structure among the SNPs in the objective function for feature selection. Specifically, motivated by the biological knowledge, the hierarchical structures involving gene groups and linkage disequilibrium (LD) blocks as well as individual SNPs are imposed as a tree-guided regularization term in our TGSL model. Experimental studies on simulation data and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data show that our method not only achieves better predictions than competing methods on the MRI-derived measures of AD-related region of interests (ROIs) (i.e., hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus), but also identifies sparse SNP patterns at the block level to better guide the biological interpretation.},

In many cases, relationships between entities are unambiguously known: are two users “friends” in a social network? Do two researchers collaborate on a published article? Do two road segments in a transportation system intersect? These are directly observable in the system in question. In most cases, relationships between nodes are not directly observable and must be inferred: Does one gene regulate the expression of another? Do two animals who physically co-locate have a social bond? Who infected whom in a disease outbreak in a population?Existing approaches for inferring networks from data are found across many application domains and use specialized knowledge to infer and measure the quality of inferred network for a specific task or hypothesis. However, current research lacks a rigorous methodology that employs standard statistical validation on inferred models. In this survey, we examine (1) how network representations are constructed from underlying data, (2) the variety of questions and tasks on these representations over several domains, and (3) validation strategies for measuring the inferred network’s capability of answering questions on the system of interest.},

Recent research focused primarily on the information provided by such devices, i.e., whether the information is accurate and meaningful to people. However, little is known about how people judge the credibility of such information, and how the functionality and the design may influence such judgements. Hence, the aim of this research was to examine how consumers assess the credibility of sleep-tracking devices. We conducted a qualitative study with 22 participants who tracked their sleep for 3 nights with three different devices: Fitbit Charge 2, Neuroon EEG, and SleepScope, a medical sleep monitor. Based on semi-structured interviews, we found that people assess the credibility of sleep-tracking devices based not only on the credibility of sleep data per se, but also on device functionality, interface design and physical appearance. People found it difficult to judge credibility, because of the complexities of sleep stages and micro-arousals (sleep fallacy) and the black boxed nature of devices (black box fallacy), and also because of the misalignment between objective sleep measures and subjective sleep quality. We discuss the significance of design and functionality on the credibility of personal health technologies and highlight design challenges and opportunities to enhance their credibility.},

abstract = {Over the past two decades, the ability of machines to challenge and beat humans at complex games has made “quantum” leaps, rhetorically if not in technical computing terms.In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue supercomputer used “brute force” computing power to out-calculate Grand Master Garry Kasparov at chess. In 2011, the company's Watson employed “machine learning” (ML) techniques to beat several former Jeopardy champions at their own game. In early 2016, Google's DeepMind AlphaGo program-trained by a massive game history-repeatedly defeated the reigning European champion at Go: a game that has more possible board configurations than there are atoms in the universe [1]. It reached this milestone by employing two neural networks powered by sophisticated “automated decision making” (ADM) algorithms. And, in 2017, AlphaGo Zero became the strongest Go player on the planet-human or machine-after just a few months of game-play training alone. Incredibly, it was programmed initially only with the rules of the game [2].Automated decision making concerns decision making by purely technological means without human involvement. Article 22(1) of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) enshrines the right of data subjects not to be subject to decisions, which have legal or other significant effects, being based solely on automatic individual decision making. As a consequence, in this paper we consider applications of ADM to applications other than those based on personal information, for example the game-playing discussed above. We discuss other aspects of GDPR later in the paper. Whilst the game-playing results are impressive, the consequences of machine learning and automated decision making are themselves, however, no game. As of this writing, they have progressed to enable computers to rival humans' ability at even more challenging, ambiguous, and highly skilled tasks with profound “real world” applications, such as: recognizing images, understanding speech, and analysing X-rays among many others. As these techniques continue to improve rapidly, many new and established companies are utilizing them to build applications that reliably perform activities that previously were done (and doable) only by people. Today, such systems can both augment human decision making and, in some cases, replace it with a fully autonomous system.In this report, we review the principal implications of the coming widespread adoption of MLdriven automated decision making with a particular emphasis on its technical, ethical, legal, economic, societal and educational ramifications. We also make a number of recommendations that policy makers might wish to consider.}

abstract = { Handling missing values in a dataset is a long-standing issue across many disciplines. Missing values can arise from different sources such as mishandling of samples, measurement errors, lack of responses, or deleted values. The main problem emerging from this situation is that many algorithms can’t run with incomplete datasets. Several methods exist for handling missing values, including “SoftImpute”, “k-nearest neighbor”, “mice”, “MatrixFactorization”, and “miss- Forest”. However, performance comparisons for these methods are hard to find, as most research approaches usually face imputation as an intermediate problem of a regression or a classification task, and only focus on this task’s performance. In addition, comparisons with existing scientific work are difficult, due to the lack of evaluations on publicly-available, open-access datasets. In order to overcome the aforementioned obstacles, in this paper we are proposing four new open datasets, representing data from real use cases, collected from publicly-available existing datasets, so as anyone can have access to them and compare their experimental results. Then, we compared the performance of some of the state-of-art approaches and most frequently used methods for missing data imputation. In addition to that, we have proposed and evaluated two new approaches, one based on Denoising Autoencoders and one on bagging. All in all, 17 different methods were tested using four different real world, publicly available datasets.},

One common approach is to seek the common information that is shared among different modalities for learning, whereas we can also fuse the supplementary information to leverage modality-specific information. Though the supplementary information is often desired, most existing multimodal approaches can only learn from samples with complete modalities, which wastes a considerable amount of data collected. Otherwise, model-based imputation needs to be used to complete the missing values and yet may introduce undesired noise, especially when the sample size is limited. In this paper, we proposed a framework based on knowledge distillation, utilizing the supplementary information from all modalities, and avoiding imputation and noise associated with it. Specifically, we first train models on each modality independently using all the available data. Then the trained models are used as teachers to teach the student model, which is trained with the samples having complete modalities. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in extensive empirical studies on both synthetic datasets and real-world datasets.},

Yet, little is known about these processes of technology appropriation and how care practices are impacted. Adopting a relational perspective of care, we longitudinally examined how four family care networks appropriated a new commercial ICT service into their existing technological arrangements and care practices. Cross-case analysis interpreted collaborative appropriation to encompass two interrelated processes of creating and adapting technological practices and negotiating and augmenting care relationships. Four driving forces were also proposed: motivating meanings that actors ascribe to the technology and its use; the learnability of the technology and actors’ resourcefulness; the establishment of responsive and cooperative care practices; and the qualities of empathy and shared power in care relationships. The importance of technological literacy, learning, meaning-making, and the nature and quality of care relationships are discussed. Future work is urged to employ longitudinal and naturalistic approaches, and focus design efforts on promoting synergistic care relationships and care practices.},

abstract = {Augmented Reality (AR) offers the possibility to enrich the real world with digital mediated content, increasing in this way the quality of many everyday experiences. While in some research areas such as cultural heritage, tourism, or medicine there is a strong technological investment, AR for game purposes struggles to become a widespread commercial application. In this article, a novel framework for AR kid games is proposed, already developed by the authors for other AR applications such as Cultural Heritage and Arts. In particular, the framework includes different layers such as the development of a series of AR kid puzzle games in an intermediate structure which can be used as a standard for different applications development, the development of a smart configuration tool, together with general guidelines and long-life usage tests and metrics. The proposed application is designed for augmenting the puzzle experience, but can be easily extended to other AR gaming applications. Once the user has assembled the real puzzle, AR functionality within the mobile application can be unlocked, bringing to life puzzle characters, creating a seamless game that merges AR interactions with the puzzle reality. The main goals and benefits of this framework can be seen in the development of a novel set of AR tests and metrics in the pre-release phase (in order to help the commercial launch and developers), and in the release phase by introducing the measures for long-life app optimization, usage tests and hint on final users together with a measure to design policy, providing a method for automatic testing of quality and popularity improvements. Moreover, smart configuration tools, as part of the general framework, enabling multi-app and eventually also multi-user development, have been proposed, facilitating the serialization of the applications. Results were obtained from a large-scale user test with about 4 million users on a set of eight gaming applications, providing the scientific community a workflow for implicit quantitative analysis in AR gaming. Different data analytics developed on the data collected by the framework prove that the proposed approach is affordable and reliable for long-life testing and optimization.},

abstract = {Mitochondrial health underlies many critical processes in the cell, and the health of the mitochondria is in turn regulated by mitochondrial dynamics -- the joint processes of mitochondrial fission, fusion and trafficking within the cell. The role of mitochondrial dynamics in regulating both ATP production and apoptosis via maintaining mitochondrial morphology has only recently been described. In particular, this regulation is a key etiology for neurodegenerative diseases due to the high energetic requirement of neural cells. Although the central effectors of fusion and fission have been identified, little is known about how accessory proteins and regulatory networks affect context-dependent and temporal changes in the mitochondrial network. In this review, we will mainly focus on the mechanisms of mitochondrial fission, fusion and trafficking, as well as the regulation in neurodegenerative diseases, hoping to provide a new direction for the future researches and the treatments of neurodegenerative diseases by regulating mitochondrial dynamics.},

abstract = {An Unscented Hound for Working Memory (AUHWM) is a new framework for the real-time tracking of human Working Memory (WM) that can be used to adapt computer interfaces to users' available cognitive resources. WM is the part of human cognition responsible for the short term storing and handling of information; it can, in stressful situations, under information overload or when suffering from dementia-like diseases, become severely limited, possibly leading to poor decision making. Our preliminary results suggest that AUHWM can provide a precise and timely assessment of WM capacity, so that the cognitive load a specific task imposes on users can be adapted, e.g., at the User Interface (UI) level. AUHWM is based on a low-level stochastic discrete model of human WM dynamics, implemented as a Gradient-Boosting-derived deterministic algorithm that simulates users' oblivion. AUHWM also performs Unscented Kalman filtering to track users' WM-specific parameters in real time, thus providing a dynamic assessment of their cognitive resources. Our approach has been tested and validated using data collected from Match$ ^2$s, a visual memory game played by 18 users in another study. Going beyond real-time WM tracking, AUHWM is intended to also be used for WM prediction, paving the way to the adaptation of tasks and their UIs in real time as a function of users' cognitive abilities; we detail an example of such an adapted system, and provide experimental evidence this approach could lead to future enhanced WM-adapted UIs.},

However, when some kinds of content are stripped of context and made available for reuse, there are several knock-on effects. In this paper, we discuss how these knock-on effects can complicate the illustration of Wikipedia's encyclopedic articles. We focus on the particularly difficult case of illustrating articles about female anatomy and women's health. Through our analysis, we demonstrate several barriers to illustrating these kinds of articles, including a lack of representative images on Wikimedia Commons, complex issues of consent, and editorial disagreements about the intended audiences for such images. We argue that these barriers are, in part, the unanticipated effects of decontextualization and subsequent recontextualization as images are removed from their original contexts and made available in Wikimedia Commons. Drawing on prior work in language acquisition and archival studies, we critique the design of commons-based peer production systems and suggest ways in which they might be re-designed to account better for the nuances of context. Finally, we raise questions about the costs of recontextualization in peer production systems in general.},

isbn = {9781947487079},
publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool},
abstract = {The Fourier transform is one of the most fundamental tools for computing the frequency representation of signals. It plays a central role in signal processing, communications, audio and video compression, medical imaging, genomics, astronomy, as well as many other areas. Because of its widespread use, fast algorithms for computing the Fourier transform can benefit a large number of applications. The fastest algorithm for computing the Fourier transform is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) which runs in near-linear time making it an indispensable tool for many applications. However, today, the runtime of the FFT algorithm is no longer fast enough especially for big data problems where each dataset can be few terabytes. Hence, faster algorithms that run in sublinear time, i.e., do not even sample all the data points, have become necessary.The Sparse Fourier Transform: Theory and Practice book shows how to address the above problem by developing the Sparse Fourier Transform algorithms and building practical systems that use these algorithms to solve key problems in six different applications.Part I of the book focuses on the theory front. It introduces the Sparse Fourier Transform algorithms: a family of sublinear time algorithms for computing the Fourier transform faster than FFT. The Sparse Fourier Transform is based on the insight that many real-world signals are sparse, i.e., most of the frequencies have negligible contribution to the overall signal. Exploiting this sparsity, the book introduces several new algorithms which encompass two main axes: runtime complexity and sampling complexity. The book presents nearly optimal Sparse Fourier Transform algorithms that are faster than FFT and have the lowest runtime complexity known to date. It also presents Sparse Fourier Transform algorithms with optimal sampling complexity in the average case and the same nearly optimal runtime complexity. These algorithms use the minimum number of input data samples and hence, reduce acquisition cost and I/O overhead.Part II of the book focuses on the systems front. It describes software and hardware architectures for leveraging the Sparse Fourier Transform to address practical problems in six applied fields. In the area of wireless networks, it demonstrates how to use the Sparse Fourier Transform to build a wireless receiver that captures GHz-wide signals without sampling at the Nyquist rate enabling wideband spectrum sensing and acquisition using cheap commodity hardware. In mobile systems, the book introduces a new GPS receiver design that both reduces the delay to find the location and decreases the power consumption. In computer graphics, light fields enable new virtual reality and computational photography applications like interactive viewpoint changes, depth extraction and refocusing. The book shows that reconstructing light field images using the Sparse Fourier Transform reduces camera sampling requirements and improves image reconstruction quality. In the area of medical imaging, the book described how to enable efficient magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), a new medical imaging technique that can reveal biomarkers for diseases like autism and cancer. In Biochemistry, it shows how the Sparse Fourier Transform can reduce Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiment time from weeks to days, enabling high dimensional NMR needed for discovering complex protein structures. Finally, in digital circuits, the book develops a chip with the largest Fourier Transform to date for sparse data. It delivers a 0.75 million point Sparse Fourier Transform chip that consumes 40x less power than prior FFT VLSI implementations. All these systems customize the theoretical algorithms to capture the structure of sparsity in each application, and hence maximize the resulting gains. The book also presents prototypes and evaluations of these systems in accordance with the standards of each application domain.This book is a revised version of the author's 2016 ACM Dissertation Award winning Ph.D. thesis. The revisions include editing, formatting, and minor corrections.}

We partner with CaringBridge.org—a prominent online health community for journaling about health crises—to conduct a study of instrumental support in the following two phases: a content analysis of 641 journal updates; and a survey of 991 users. Quantitative results show that: (1) patients and family caregivers prefer to receive different types of support than their care networks prefer to provide; (2) people generally have more trust in their closest social connections than acquaintances or businesses to provide instrumental support; and (3) users rate “prayer support” as the most important support category to them. Building on these results, we discuss design implications to accommodate divergent preferences and to expand instrumental support networks. We also discuss the need for future work to empower family caregivers and to support spirituality, an understudied topic in HCI.},

The first step is to classify neurodegenerative brain diseases in the considered scans from the available neuroimaging techniques. We propose to classify scans by selecting relevant disease detection features utilizing a gametheoretic approach and evidence combination. We applied a filtering feature selection based on a coalitional game. The second step is to aggregate the classifiers' outcomes by leveraging an improvement of the Dempster-Shafer combination rule obtained by applying evolutionary game theory to determine a final decision from the various classifiers' results, also considering the subjective doctor opinion. Last, the overall solution can be deployed in a distributed manner. The robustness of the interactions is achievable by modeling them as a signaling game to determine when rejecting those messages suspected of being malicious.},

abstract = {The application of machine learning methods for the identification of candidate genes responsible for phenotypes of interest, such as cancer, is a major challenge in the field of bioinformatics. These lists of genes are often called genomic signatures and their linkage to phenotype associations may form a significant step in discovering the causation between genotypes and phenotypes. Traditional methods that produce genomic signatures from DNA Microarray data tend to extract significantly different lists under relatively small variations of the training data. That instability hinders the validity of research findings and raises skepticism about the reliability of such methods. In this study, a complete framework for the extraction of stable and reliable lists of candidate genes is presented. The proposed methodology enforces stability of results at the validation step and as a result, it is independent of the feature selection and classification methods used. Furthermore, two different statistical tests are performed in order to assess the statistical significance of the observed results. Moreover, the consistency of the signatures extracted by independent executions of the proposed method is also evaluated. The results of this study highlight the importance of stability issues in genomic signatures, beyond their prediction capabilities.},

The system also exploits characteristics of different eye movement stages and adjusts its sensing and computation accordingly for further energy savings. A prototype is built with off-the-shelf hardware components and integrated into a regular pair of glasses. Experiments with 22 participants show that the system achieves 0.8-mm mean error in tracking pupil position (2.3 mm at the 95th percentile) and 0.3-mm mean error in tracking pupil diameter (0.9 mm at the 95th percentile) at 120-Hz output frame rate, consuming 395 µW mean power supplied by two small, thin solar cells on glasses side arms.},

abstract = {Nanobots are robots of size below 200nm. Due to the various restrictions and the multifaceted aspects of a nanobot its difficult to implement as compared to a microbot (having size in the micrometer scale). The construction of Nanobots is heavily dependent on Molecular nanotechnology and Mechano-synthetic chemistry. These robots are NEMS (Nano-electro Mechanical Systems) based devices which are programmed to carry out either one or multiple tasks with high efficiency, minimal work output and consumption of power. The Size and wide programmable capabilities of Nanobots allow them to have huge scope in bio-medical, pure medical and pharmaceutical applications. There are different ways to create nanobots as they can either be made purely synthetic or biodegradable or a mix of both called Bio-Hybrid nanobots. This paper provides an overview of some of the feasible construction techniques that can be used to build nanobots for their use in the biomedical applications and current trends and future scope of nanobots in biomedical applications.},

abstract = {Augmented reality (AR) is a promising tool for many situations in which assistance is needed, as it allows for instructions and feedback to be contextualized. While research and development in this area have been primarily driven by industry, AR could also have a huge impact on those who need assistance the most: cognitively impaired people of all ages. In recent years some primary research on applying AR for action assistance and learning in the context of this target group has been conducted. However, the research field is sparsely covered and contributions are hard to categorize. An overview of the current state of research is missing. We contribute to filling this gap by providing a systematic literature review covering 52 publications. We describe the often rather technical publications on an abstract level and quantitatively assess their usage purpose, the targeted age group and the type of AR device used. Additionally, we provide insights on the current challenges and chances of AR learning and action assistance for people with cognitive impairments. We discuss trends in the research field, including potential future work for researchers to focus on.},

abstract = {Roughly 50 million people worldwide are currently suffering from dementia. This number is expected to triple by 2050. Dementia is characterized by a loss of cognitive function and changes in behaviour. This includes memory, language skills, and the ability to focus and pay attention. However, it has been shown that secondary therapy such as the physical, social and cognitive activation of People with Dementia (PwD) has significant positive effects. Activation impacts cognitive functioning and can help prevent the magnification of apathy, boredom, depression, and loneliness associated with dementia. Furthermore, activation can lead to higher perceived quality of life. We follow Cohen's argument that activation stimuli have to produce engagement to take effect and adopt his definition of engagement as "the act of being occupied or involved with an external stimulus".},

In this paper, we elaborate on the possibilities of utilizing an iterative installation design, based on the original prototype of Closer to Nature for improving quality of life of people with dementia in Long-Term Care. The installation was built as a permanent part of the living environment in a Dutch nursing home with the purpose of long-term use. User evaluation in real-life setting was conducted with 15 residents, 4 family members and 2 professional caregivers. Preliminary user feedback was gathered through interviews and showed sufficient positive evidence of enhanced engagement. Additionally, a new design concept developed upon insights from the user evaluation is introduced which utilizes a plaster goat covered with sensors for initiating interactions. Implications and future studies of the designs are proposed.},

This interdisciplinary collaboration builds on data collected as part of a large set of behavioral and brain variables in patients with post-stroke aphasia, charting the course of recovery associated with therapy across language domains and examining the basis of neuroplasticity. In this pilot study, we created and tested a predictive framework based on a subset of the data collected and developed machine-learning algorithms that take as input a complex set of brain and behavioral features to classify and predict the participants' responsiveness to therapy. We developed Random Forest models that enabled us to rank the importance of these features. We then compared the contributions of different feature sets and discussed their physiological implications. Our preliminary results suggest the potential of our framework, and, thus, this study takes an important first step towards predicting individualized rehabilitation outcomes.},

This is important as such memories are key in the development and maintenance of the sense of self, particularly in old age. We report on interviews with 8 older adults in their homes. Findings advance the understanding of self-defining memories and their possible cues with new insights into their relationship with self-identities and cues' specific qualities supporting richer emotional recall. Our findings led to several design implications such as novel technologies for curating self-defining memories and their cues, for embedding layered meaning in such cues across the lifespan, for crafting them, and sensitive design for their physical handling.},

In this paper, we concentrate on applying the previously proposed algorithm on a different biosignal, photoplethysmography (PPG), to improve MCI classification. We also demonstrate data acquisition using a finger-tip wireless pulse oximeter and feature extraction from PPG. Our classification accuracy is 0.90 ± 0.01 with the dataset from 62 elderly participants (72.71 ± 10.63 years; 31 MCI and 31 control), which is a higher classification accuracy than only using the administered neuropsychological measures. This study verifies that PPG-derived parameters also have the potential to enhance the ability to accurately diagnosis cognitive impairment.},

These data constitute a rich representation of entities’ whereabouts and behavior as they move on the map. Although several studies reported considerable predictability of such mobility patterns, several factors may impose significant changes on moving behavior. Being able to detect these changes can benefit several applications. In this article, we formalize and address the problem of detecting mobility drifts in mobility patterns. This problem is particularly challenging due to the noisy and incomplete nature of the data. We design non-parametric tests and present two algorithms to detect mobility drifts when the putative drift point is known in advance and there is no previous knowledge about the existence of potential changes, and we need to search for the most likely drift point rigorously. To evaluate our algorithms, we perform an extensive experimental study with real-world data coming from a variety of scenarios, such as geo-tagged social media data and GPS traces of connected vehicles. The results show the effectiveness of our algorithms, being able to identify existing drift points on spatial mobility patterns correctly.},

Our main contribution lies within the detailed results on perceived safety, usability, and acceptance from field trials with autonomous robots in real homes of older users. In these field trials, we studied how 16 older adults (75 plus) lived with autonomously interacting service robots over multiple weeks.Robots have been employed for periods of months previously in home environments for older people, and some have been tested with manipulation abilities, but this is the first time a study has tested a robot in private homes that provided the combination of manipulation abilities, autonomous navigation, and non-scheduled interaction for an extended period of time. This article aims to explore how older adults interact with such a robot in their private homes. Our results show that all users interacted with Hobbit daily, rated most functions as well working, and reported that they believe that Hobbit will be part of future elderly care. We show that Hobbit’s adaptive behavior approach towards the user increasingly eased the interaction between the users and the robot. Our trials reveal the necessity to move into actual users’ homes, as only there, we encounter real-world challenges and demonstrate issues such as misinterpretation of actions during non-scripted human-robot interaction.},

Considering that a typical symptom of dementia, especially Alzheimer's disease, is language impairment, speech-based dementia detection approaches have drawn much attention. This paper presents a smartphone-based dementia screening application, VocabChecker, which measures language abilities from a speech narrative via automatic speech recognition (ASR). It measures four language abilities related to dementia: number of tokens (token), number of types (type), type token ratio (TTR), and potential vocabulary size (PVS). We also reported that the use of VocabChecker has distinguished dementia patients from elderly people.},

abstract = {Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) operations are commonly used in various scientific and engineering applications. The performance of the SpMV operation often depends on exploiting regularity patterns in the matrix. Various representations and optimization techniques have been proposed to minimize the memory bandwidth bottleneck arising from the irregular memory access pattern involved. Among recent representation techniques, tensor decomposition is a popular one used for very large but sparse matrices. Post sparse-tensor decomposition, the new representation involves indirect accesses, making it challenging to optimize for multi-cores and even more demanding for the massively parallel architectures, such as on GPUs.Computational neuroscience algorithms often involve sparse datasets while still performing long-running computations on them. The Linear Fascicle Evaluation (LiFE) application is a popular neuroscience algorithm used for pruning brain connectivity graphs. The datasets employed herein involve the Sparse Tucker Decomposition (STD)—a widely used tensor decomposition method. Using this decomposition leads to multiple indirect array references, making it very difficult to optimize on both multi-core and many-core systems. Recent implementations of the LiFE algorithm show that its SpMV operations are the key bottleneck for performance and scaling.In this work, we first propose target-independent optimizations to optimize the SpMV operations of LiFE decomposed using the STD technique, followed by target-dependent optimizations for CPU and GPU systems. The target-independent techniques include: (1) standard compiler optimizations to prevent unnecessary and redundant computations, (2)&nbsp;data restructuring techniques to minimize the effects of indirect array accesses, and (3)&nbsp;methods to partition computations among threads to obtain coarse-grained parallelism with low synchronization overhead. Then, we present the target-dependent optimizations for CPUs such as: (1)&nbsp;efficient synchronization-free thread mapping and (2) utilizing BLAS calls to exploit hardware-specific speed. Following that, we present various GPU-specific optimizations to optimally map threads at the granularity of warps, thread blocks, and grid. Furthermore, to automate the CPU-based optimizations developed for this algorithm, we also extend the PolyMage domain-specific language, embedded in Python. Our highly optimized and parallelized CPU implementation obtains a speedup of 6.3\texttimes{} over the naive parallel CPU implementation running on 16-core Intel Xeon Silver (Skylake-based) system. In addition to that, our optimized GPU implementation achieves a speedup of 5.2\texttimes{} over a reference-optimized GPU code version on NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 2080 Ti GPU and a speedup of 9.7\texttimes{} over our highly optimized and parallelized CPU implementation.},

abstract = {Although research has demonstrated the potential for social robots to positively impact a person's mood and provide comfort, very little research has yet focused on social robots supporting people living with loneliness. Much of the relevant human-robot interaction work focuses on more serious situations such as living with dementia, or on related areas such as stress, anxiety, or depression, and these works generally target the older adult demographic. Loneliness, however, can affect anyone of any health and age. In this paper we present a summary review of the current research on loneliness and social robots, highlighting the gaps in research and the potential opportunity for more work in the area.},

We also conduct a technical evaluation of Life-Tags and report results from a controlled experiment that generated 21,600 full HD snapshots from six indoor and outdoor scenarios, representative of everyday life activities, such as walking, eating, traveling, etc., with a total of 180 minutes of recorded life to abstract with tag clouds. Our experimental results and Life-Tags prototype inform design and engineering of future life abstracting systems based on smartglasses and wearable video cameras to ensure effective generation of rich clouds of concepts, reflective of the visual experience of the smartglasses user.},

Prior work shows that expert disagreement can arise due to diverse factors including expert background, the quality and presentation of data, and guideline clarity. In this work, we study how these factors predict initial discrepancies in the context of medical time series analysis, examining why certain disagreements persist after adjudication, and how adjudication impacts clinical decisions. Results from a case study with 36 experts and 4,543 adjudicated cases in a sleep stage classification task show that these factors contribute to both initial disagreement and resolvability, each in their own unique way. We provide evidence suggesting that structured adjudication can lead to significant revisions in treatment-relevant clinical parameters. Our work demonstrates how structured adjudication can support consensus and facilitate a deep understanding of expert disagreement in medical data analysis.},

abstract = {Sleep is the most important aspect of healthy and active living. The right amount of sleep at the right time helps an individual to protect his or her physical, mental, and cognitive health and maintain his or her quality of life. The most durative of the Activities of Daily Living (ADL), sleep has a major synergic influence on a person’s fuctional, behavioral, and cognitive health. A deep understanding of sleep behavior and its relationship with its physiological signals, and contexts (such as eye or body movements), is necessary to design and develop a robust intelligent sleep monitoring system. In this article, we propose an intelligent algorithm to detect the microscopic states of sleep that fundamentally constitute the components of good and bad sleeping behaviors and thus help shape the formative assessment of sleep quality. Our initial analysis includes the investigation of several classification techniques to identify and correlate the relationship of microscopic sleep states with overall sleep behavior. Subsequently, we also propose an online algorithm based on change point detection to process and classify the microscopic sleep states. We also develop a lightweight version of the proposed algorithm for real-time sleep monitoring, recognition, and assessment at scale. For a larger deployment of our proposed model across a community of individuals, we propose an active-learning-based methodology to reduce the effort of ground-truth data collection and labeling. Finally, we evaluate the performance of our proposed algorithms on real data traces and demonstrate the efficacy of our models for detecting and assessing the fine-grained sleep states beyond an individual.},

In this paper, the method of phase-based synchronization was used to calculate the phase lock value (PLV) of the local field potential(LFP) signal between the prefrontal cortex (PFC)and striatum(STR) in the monkey. We found that the phase synchronism in the beta frequency band was clearly different for different test conditions and different test stages between the two brain regions of the monkey. The beta-band LFP signal was more synchronous. The beta-band LFP signal was important in the exchange of information between two different brain regions.},

abstract = {High static power consumption is widely regarded as one of the largest bottlenecks in creating scalable optical NoCs. The standard techniques to reduce static power are based on sharing optical channels and modulating the laser. We show in this article that state-of-the-art techniques in these areas are suboptimal, and there is a significant room for further improvement. We propose two novel techniques—a neural network--based method for laser modulation by predicting optical traffic and a distributed and altruistic algorithm for channel sharing—that are significantly closer to a theoretically ideal scheme. In spite of this, a lot of laser power still gets wasted. We propose to reuse this energy to heat micro-ring resonators (achieve thermal tuning) by efficiently recirculating it. These three methods help us significantly reduce the energy requirements. Our design consumes 4.7\texttimes{} lower laser power as compared to other state-of-the-art proposals. In addition, it results in a 31% improvement in performance and 39% reduction in ED2 for a suite of Splash2 and Parsec benchmarks.},

Caregivers, such as family members, of dementia sufferers face great challenge in taking care of such patients at night as it takes a toll on their own sleep quality resulting in sleep deprivation and other issues. The goal of this work, presented in this paper, is to develop a wearable body position monitor that can detect user's body position and keep online records during sleep; provide light when data shows the user is not asleep, aid user to fall asleep with audio assist feature, and if necessary, activate emergency alert call to caregivers when the patient remains seated or stands for longer durations (e.g. more than 20 minutes) at night. Main system components of the developed prototype include MySignals HW Complete Kit (e-health medical development platform), Arduino Uno microcontroller, LEDs, speakers, micro SD card, micro SD card reader, SPI interface and esp8266 module. Real-time transmission, data analysis and visualization and remote data storage has been realized. The plan for the next phase of this work will include application of sleep pattern recognition and machine learning techniques on large datasets and real biometric measurements.},

abstract = {Tumor clustering is a powerful approach for cancer class discovery which is crucial to the effective treatment of cancer. Many traditional clustering methods such as NMF-based models, have been widely used to identify tumors. However, they cannot achieve satisfactory results. Recently, subspace clustering approaches have been proposed to improve the performance by dividing the original space into multiple low-dimensional subspaces. Among them, low rank representation is becoming a popular approach to attain subspace clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel Low Rank Subspace Clustering model via Discrete Constraint and Hypergraph Regularization DHLRS. The proposed method learns the cluster indicators directly by using discrete constraint, which makes the clustering task simple. For each subspace, we adopt Schatten $p$-norm to better approximate the low rank constraint. Moreover, Hypergraph Regularization is adopted to infer the complex relationship between genes and intrinsic geometrical structure of gene expression data in each subspace. Finally, the molecular pattern of tumor gene expression data sets is discovered according to the optimized cluster indicators. Experiments on both synthetic data and real tumor gene expression data sets prove the effectiveness of proposed DHLRS.},

abstract = {Social robots are robots interacting with humans not only in collaborative settings, but also in personal settings like domestic services and healthcare.

For care robots, the experts approve health-related tasks like drawing blood while they prefer humans to do nursing tasks like washing. On a larger societal scale, the acceptance of social robots increases highly significantly with familiarity, making health robots and even military drones more acceptable than sex robots or child companion robots for childless couples. Accordingly, the acceptance of social robots seems to decrease with the level of face-to-face emotions involved.},

abstract = {Traditional methods for screening and diagnosis of alcohol dependence are typically administered by trained clinicians in medical settings and often rely on interview responses. These self-reports can be unintentionally or deliberately false, and misleading answers can, in turn, lead to inaccurate assessment and diagnosis. In this study, we examine the use of user-game interaction patterns on mobile games to develop an automated diagnostic and screening tool for alcohol-dependent patients. Our approach relies on the capture of interaction patterns during gameplay, while potential patients engage with popular mobile games on smartphones. The captured signals include gameplay performance, touch gestures, and device motion, with the intention of identifying patients with alcohol dependence. We evaluate the classification performance of various supervised learning algorithms on data collected from 40 patients and 40 age-matched healthy adults. The results show that patients with alcohol dependence can be automatically identified accurately using the ensemble of touch, device motion, and gameplay performance features on 3-minute samples (accuracy=0.95, sensitivity=0.95, and specificity=0.95). The present findings provide strong evidence suggesting the potential use of user-game interaction metrics on existing mobile games as discriminant features for developing an implicit measure to identify alcohol dependence conditions. In addition to supporting healthcare professionals in clinical decision-making, the game-based self-screening method could be used as a novel strategy to promote alcohol dependence screening, especially outside of clinical settings.},

We present a non-intrusive approach to identify sleep stages through bed-frame vibrations. The proposed system detects the movement of users during their sleep and estimates their sleep stages via their movements induced vibration on the bed frame. Our system extracts features from the vibration signal and distinguishes sleep stages between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM). We evaluated our system in two ways 1) to understand the data distribution over different sleep stages, and 2) to explore the feasibility of distinguishing different movement characteristics over different sleep stages. The system achieved an area under curve (AUC) score of 0.84 when classifying REM sleep stages over NREM stages.},

abstract = {Tissue converting lines represent one of the key plant in the paper production field: with them, paper tissue is converted into its final form for domestic and sanitary usage. One of the key points of the tissue converting lines is the productivity and the possibility to follow conversion process at relativity low cost. Despite the actual lines have yet an high productivity, the study of the state of the art has shown that choke points still exist, caused by inadequate automation. In this paper, we present the preliminary results of a project which aims at removing such obstacle towards complete automation, by introducing a set of innovations based on ICT solutions applied to advanced automation. In detail, advanced computer vision and video analytics methods will be applied to pervasively monitor converting lines and to automatically extract process information in order to self-regulate specific machine and global parameters. Big data analysis methodologies will be also integrated to obtain new knowledge and infer optimal management models which could be used for the predictive maintenance. Augmented reality interfaces are being designed and developed to support converting line monitoring and maintenance, both ordinary and extraordinary. An Artificial Intelligence module provides suggestions and instructions to the operators in order to guarantee production level even in case of unskilled staff. The automation of such processes will improve factory safety, decrease manual interventions and, thus, will increase production line up-time and efficiency.},

abstract = {Dynamic data-driven applications such as object tracking, surveillance, and other sensing and decision applications are largely dependent on the characteristics of the data streams on which they operate. The underlying models and algorithms of data-driven applications must continually adapt at runtime to changes in data quality and availability to meet both functional and designer-specified performance requirements. Given the dynamic nature of these applications, point solutions produced by traditional design tools cannot be expected to perform adequately across varying execution scenarios. Additionally, the increasing diversity and interdependence of application requirements complicates the design and optimization process. To assist designers of data-driven applications, we present a modeling and optimization framework that enables developers to model an application's data sources, tasks, and exchanged data tokens; specify application requirements through high-level design metrics and fuzzy logic--based optimization rules; and define an estimation framework to automatically optimize the application at runtime. We demonstrate the modeling and optimization process via an example application for video-based vehicle tracking and collision avoidance. We analyze the benefits of runtime optimization by comparing the performance of static point solutions to dynamic solutions over five distinct execution scenarios, showing improvements of up to 74% for dynamic over static configurations. Further, we show the benefits of using fuzzy logic--based rules over traditional weighted functions for the specification and evaluation of competing high-level metrics in optimization.},

abstract = {Designing new technologies to support the lived experience of dementia is of increasing interest within HCI. While there is guidance on qualitative research methods to use in areas such as dementia, there is a need for more appropriate ways to research in the younger demographic. In Younger Onset Dementia (YOD), the circumstances and experiences are markedly different from dementia in the later stage of life requiring a different approach. This paper presents insights into the methods and approaches used in fieldwork with five people living with YOD; where they engaged as co-researchers in a co-directed inquiry into their lived experiences. Through this, we make a number of methodological contributions to HCI and Participatory Action Research (PAR) for research in the YOD setting. This includes productive approaches that are sensitive, respectful and empowering to the participants. It also extends current approaches to using probes in HCI and dementia research.},

abstract = {Little has been done to understand what challenges surgical patients face before surgery. Specifically, patients with multiple chronic conditions (MCC) often require prehabilitation--pre-surgery steps to improve baseline levels of health parameters required for surgery. Prehabilitation can improve health-care outcomes, reduce costs, and decrease readmissions. However, prehabilitation can be challenging for MCC patients since they need to balance chronic conditions with surgical preparation. Unsuccessful prehabilitation adherence can result in serious medical consequences including postponed surgeries and postoperative complications. In this work, we explore prehabiliation challenges faced by patients with MCC and identify opportunities for technological interventions by conducting a qualitative study of online health forum posts from 154 users. Using this data, we identified categories of patients' needs and challenges during prehabilitation.Based on our findings, we propose design recommendations to better support prehabilitation for patients with MCC.},

abstract = {The fast-phased adoption of modern immersive visual technologies in many fields calls for an assessment of potential costs and benefits from the point of view of human health. Humans often reported feelings of discomfort in the experience of virtual reality (VR), however, it is still not known what may promote this uncomfortable symptomatology. In the framework of research on human-computer interaction, part of the discomfort derived from the use of immersive visual technologies has been attribute to technological factors. Among the most cited technological limitations is the vergence-accommodation conflict that human eyes are experiencing in displays delivering 3D images, and that have been connected to feelings of discomfort and tiredness. In the present investigation we attempt to briefly review the most important pieces of evidence presented in the literature, on the possible technological limitation of immersive visual technologies and its possible effects on human health and the way those effects were analyzed, and the ill symptomologies were assessed. Furthermore, possible solutions for reducing negative effects of the use of 3D media were shortly analyzed, and new perspective on the issue reviewed. Finally, we will attempt to assess the way immersive visual technology can be used in the medical field with the aim to improve human health.},

Despite this potential, integrating sound and sound-based interventions in care facilities has not received much research attention. In this paper, we present the findings from a field study that explored the responses of 19 people with advanced dementia to a selection of everyday sounds presented to them in a care home and the role of these responses in the care environment. To study this, we deployed Vita, a 'pillow-like' sound player, in two dementia care facilities for four weeks, during which observations were recorded. Afterwards, we conducted interviews with caregivers who used Vita in everyday care practice. Our findings reveal how everyday sounds provided by Vita stimulated meaningful conversation, playfulness, and connection between residents and caregivers. Furthermore, we propose design implications for integrating everyday sounds in dementia care.},

Though work to date has largely addressed functional needs, there is a growing recognition of the importance of supporting meaningful activities. However, technology for active, rather than passive, engagement is relatively novel beyond specific applications (e.g., music or reminiscence therapy). To better understand how to support active engagement of people with dementia in activities, we interviewed nineteen practitioners. Our findings reveal differing approaches to making sense of the actions of people with dementia, as well as to engaging them in activities. We discuss the importance of tracing epistemological understandings of dementia to different configurations of technology for people living with dementia and provide a practical guide to support designers to do so. Finally, we discuss considerations for the design of dementia technologies around facilitating self-actualization and managing emotional exposure for care-providers.},

abstract = {One key technique people use in conversation and collaboration is conversational repair. Self-repair is the recognition and attempted correction of one's own mistakes. We investigate how the self-repair of errors by intelligent voice assistants affects user interaction. In a controlled human-participant study (N =101), participants asked Amazon Alexa to perform four tasks, and we manipulated whether Alexa would "make a mistake'' understanding the participant (for example, playing heavy metal in response to a request for relaxing music) and whether Alexa would perform a correction (for example, stating, "You don't seem pleased. Did I get that wrong?'') We measured the impact of self-repair on the participant's perception of the interaction in four conditions: correction (mistakes made and repair performed), undercorrection (mistakes made, no repair performed), overcorrection (no mistakes made, but repair performed), and control (no mistakes made, and no repair performed). Subsequently, we conducted free-response interviews with each participant about their interactions. This study finds that self-repair greatly improves people's assessment of an intelligent voice assistant if a mistake has been made, but can degrade assessment if no correction is needed. However, we find that the positive impact of self-repair in the wake of an error outweighs the negative impact of overcorrection. In addition, participants who recently experienced an error saw increased value in self-repair as a feature, regardless of whether they experienced a repair themselves.},

Based on a survey with 794 participants from Germany and the three Arab countries of Egypt, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia, we discuss how culture influences the preferences for certain attributes. We look at social roles, abilities and appearance, emotional awareness and interactivity of social robots, as well as the attitude toward automation. Preferences were found to differ not only across cultures, but also within countries with similar cultural backgrounds. Our findings also show a nuanced picture of the impact of previously identified culturally variable factors, such as attitudes toward traditions and innovations. While the participants’ perspectives toward traditions and innovations varied, these factors did not fully account for the cultural variations in their perceptions of social robots. In conclusion, we believe that more real-life practices emerging from the situated use of robots should be investigated. Besides focusing on the impact of broader cultural values such as those associated with religion and traditions, future studies should examine how users interact, or avoid interaction, with robots within specific contexts of use.},

Therapeutic touch has been used for conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Sensory Processing Disorder and Dementia as a calming agent. Smart clothing and textiles have the potential to not only sense, monitor and collect data (inputs) but also to act on the body with embedded actuation capabilities (outputs) such as promoting mechanical, electrical and thermal tactile stimuli. Thus far, the emphasis in the design of wearables, including smart clothing, has been on inputs, with comparatively little research on the responsive output capabilities. This research presents design requirements for development of a user-friendly wearable product for compression therapy and reports development of a reactive undershirt with embedded textile-based pneumatic actuators that deliver tactile stimulation in response to change in emotional state to calm anxiety. The proposed design can offer novel ways of complementing care to empower people with dementia in everyday situations because of its ubiquitous nature and its affordance.},

In the longitudinal study, we explored how the BPSD in older adults could be affected by use of a teleoperated android robot named Telenoid that could potentially promote conversation. This study was conducted at a long-term residential care facility, and it was a prospective, 10-week, single arm, exploratory user study. Diminishing the barrier of digital divide, the android robot provided those with dementia with a way to remotely communicate with others. BPSD were assessed using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Nursing Home Version (NPI-NH), and we investigated changes in the participants over time. According to NPI-NH scores, Telenoid could improve BPSD in older adults with "anxiety," and "appetite and eating change." The results indicate that as a non-pharmacological approach, daily use of the conversation promoting android robot could have a therapeutic effect on the BPSD in older adults.},

These aids are often necessary for wayfinding in virtual environments with complex paths. We introduce a novel adaptive aid that maintains the effectiveness of traditional aids, while equipping designers and users with the controls of how often help is displayed. Our adaptive aid uses gaze patterns in predicting user's need for navigation aid in VR and displays mini-maps or arrows accordingly. Using a dataset of gaze angle sequences of users navigating a VR environment and markers of when users requested aid, we trained an LSTM to classify user's gaze sequences as needing navigation help and display an aid. We validated the efficacy of the adaptive aid for wayfinding compared to other commonly-used wayfinding aids.},

abstract = {Many people with dementia (PWD) residing in long-term care may face barriers in accessing experiences beyond their physical premises; this may be due to location, mobility constraints, legal mental health act restrictions, or offence-related restrictions. In recent years, there have been research interests towards designing non-pharmacological interventions aiming to improve the Quality of Life (QoL) for PWD within long-term care. We explored the use of Virtual Reality (VR) as a tool to provide 360°-video based experiences for individuals with moderate to severe dementia residing in a locked psychiatric hospital. We discuss at depth the appeal of using VR for PWD, and the observed impact of such interaction. We also present the design opportunities, pitfalls, and recommendations for future deployment in healthcare services. This paper demonstrates the potential of VR as a virtual alternative to experiences that may be difficult to reach for PWD residing within locked setting.},

abstract = {Residential aged care facilities (RACFs) provide full-time, permanent care for older adults who are no longer able to live at home independently. In these facilities, new technology such as tablets, virtual reality, and social robots are increasingly being deployed with the aim of providing engaging and fun activities for residents. Although HCI research has examined the design and use of technology in aged care, there is limited understanding of the role staff members play in its deployment in RACFs. We interviewed five workers from one Australian RACF about new technology use within their facility. We found that its implementation was part of a complex, decision-making hierarchy in which issues such as marketing potential and staff members' roles and capacity, created tensions about the use of new technology. Drawing on our findings, we identify issues HCI researchers should consider when introducing new technology in this complex environment.},

abstract = {Many of the virtual reality (VR) interaction devices available to the general public rely on the use of controllers. However, theses ones generate some usability constraints. Current availability of new gestural devices provides a more "natural" way to interact in VR, i.e. minimizing cognitive load. However, this last one is rarely taken into account in the literature on VR design and evaluation. In order to fill this gap, we propose to evaluate, within a comparative study, the respective impact of 2 interaction paradigms on the cognitive load and performance of two different user populations (experienced vs. novice): gestural interaction using Leap Motion® (test group) and more traditional interaction using gamepad controllers (control group). Initial results indicate significantly higher cognitive load and significantly lower performance during gestural interaction with the Leap Motion® than during interaction with the controllers. These results highlight technical limitations related to Leap Motion® and the need to improve technically these devices to obtain a robust technology},

abstract = { Empathy tools are experiences designed to evoke empathetic responses by placing the user in another’s lived and felt experience. The problem is that designers do not have a common vocabulary to describe empathy tool experiences; consequently, it is difficult to compare/contrast empathy tool designs or to think about their efficacy. To address this problem, we analyzed 26 publications on empathy tools to develop a descriptive framework for designers of empathy tools. Based on our analysis, we found that empathy tools can be described along three dimensions: (i) the amount of agency the tool allows, (ii) the user’s perspective while using the tool, and (iii) the type of sensations that are experienced. We show that this framework can be used to describe a wide variety of empathy tools and provide recommendations for empathy tool designers, as well as techniques for measuring the efficacy of an empathy tool experience. },

abstract = {A sleep deficit has far-reaching consequences, but for many people, healthy sleep is not a priority or a possibility. We explore the potential for "sleepy games" as a genre of transformational games. To explore this design space, we prototyped nine games through an iterative design process. Based on analysis of design decisions and the games as artifacts, we identify seven design challenges for sleepy games: agency and control; physiological and mental arousal; intervention timing; social embeddedness; multisensory experience; vulnerability; and identity and values. We expand on three games with playtesting to show how these design challenges unfold for players in practice, show the impact on players' lives, and discuss sleepy games as creative, social, and situated practices.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies GWAS link full genome data to a handful of traits. However, in neuroimaging studies, there is an almost unlimited number of traits that can be extracted for full image-wide big data analyses. Large populations are needed to achieve the necessary power to detect statistically significant effects, emphasizing the need to pool data across multiple studies. Neuroimaging consortia, e.g., ENIGMA and CHARGE, are now analyzing MRI data from over 30,000 individuals. Distributed processing protocols extract harmonized features at each site, and pool together only the cohort statistics using meta analysis to avoid data sharing. To date, such MRI projects have focused on single measures such as hippocampal volume, yet voxelwise analyses e.g., tensor-based morphometry; TBM may help better localize statistical effects. This can lead to $10^{13}$1013 tests for GWAS and become underpowered. We developed an analytical framework for multi-site TBM by performing multi-channel registration to cohort-specific templates. Our results highlight the reliability of the method and the added power over alternative options while preserving single site specificity and opening the doors for well-powered image-wide genome-wide discoveries.},

We applied PERCEPT in a project to develop a smart home toolset that will allow a person living with early stage dementia or Parkinson's to plan, monitor and self-manage his or her life and well-being more effectively. We present a set of personas which were co-created with people and applied throughout the project in the co-design process. The approach presented in this paper will enable researchers and designers to better engage with target user groups in co-design and point to considerations to be made at each step for vulnerable users.},

Strategies that the usable security literature indicates are likely to work are those that (1) avoid overloading the user's primary task; (2) help people understand negative consequences of their actions; and (3) support the long-term education of users with analytic reasoning skills and adequate background knowledge. Several of the responses to election interference proposed by governments and technology companies so far do not abide by these recommendations and are likely to be ineffective.},

abstract = {Critical flicker frequency (CFF) is the minimum frequency at which a flickering light source appears fused to an observer. Measuring CFF can support early diagnosis of minimal hepatic encephalopathy (MHE), a condition affecting up to 80% of people with cirrhosis of the liver. However, adoption of CFF measurement in clinical practice has been hampered by the cost of a device for measuring CFF and the need for specialized training to administer the test. This paper presents Beacon, a portable, inexpensive device that enables people to measure their own critical flicker frequency. We adopt a mixed-methods approach to informing and evaluating the design of and potential opportunities for Beacon. We first report on a two-part formative study with 10 participants to evaluate the choice of certain parameters in the design of Beacon. We then report on a study of 41 healthy adults ranging from 18 to 99 years of age, finding that Beacon performs on par with Lafayette Flicker Fusion System, an established medical device, achieving a pearson correlation coefficient of 0.88. We finally report on a focus group with five hepatoligists who work with patients with cirrhosis of the liver, using our initial prototype development to examine their perspectives on potential opportunities and challenges in adoption of a device like Beacon. We discuss Beacon as an exploration of reframing critical flicker frequency measurement from a clinical screening tool into a self-administered self-tracking measure, thereby drawing upon and contributing to research in the health and personal informatics.},
