Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most
   common type of dementia with a great prevalence in western countries.
   The diagnosis of AD and its progression is performed through a variety
   of clinical procedures including neuropsychological and physical
   examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, brain imaging and
   blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of the
   electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research
   interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper
   summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the
   correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is
   estimated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49
   experimental studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine
   learning algorithms on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients,
   are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are presented and
   compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection
   incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques
   have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions
   for future studies are presented.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Alzheimer \& rsquo;s disease (AD) is a progressive and
   irreversible neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, machine
   learning methods have been widely used on analysis of neuroimage for
   quantitative evaluation and computer-aided diagnosis of AD or prediction
   on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. In this
   study, we aimed to develop a new deep learning method to detect or
   predict AD in an efficient way.
   Materials and methods: We proposed a densely connected convolution
   neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism to learn the
   multi-level features of brain MR images for AD classification. We used
   the densely connected neural network to extract multi-scale features
   from pre-processed images, and connection wise attention mechanism was
   applied to combine connections among features from different layers to
   hierarchically transform the MR images into more compact high-level
   features. Furthermore, we extended the convolution operation to 3D to
   capture the spatial information of MRI. The features extracted from each
   3D convolution layer were integrated with features from all preceding
   layers with different attention, and were finally used for
   classification. Our method was evaluated on the baseline MRI of 968
   subjects from ADNI database to discriminate (1) AD versus healthy
   subjects, (2) MCI converters versus healthy subjects, and (3) MCI
   converters versus non-converters.
   Results: The proposed method achieved 97.35\% accuracy for
   distinguishing AD patients from healthy control, 87.82\% for MCI
   converters against healthy control, and 78.79\% for MCI converters
   against non-converters. Compared with some neural networks and methods
   reported in recent studies, the classification performance of our
   proposed algorithm was among the top ranks and improved in
   discriminating MCI subjects who were in high risks of conversion to AD.
   Conclusions: Deep learning techniques provide a powerful tool to explore
   minute but intricate characteristics in MR images which may facilitate
   early diagnosis and prediction of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection using magnetic resonance image
   (MRI), plays a crucial role in the treatment of dementia disease at an
   early stage. Deep learning architecture produces impressive results in
   such research. Algorithms require a large number of annotated datasets
   for training the model. In this study, we overcome this issue by using
   layer-wise transfer learning as well as tissue segmentation of brain
   images to diagnose the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In
   layer-wise transfer learning, we used the VGG architecture family with
   pre-trained weights. The proposed model segregates between normal
   control (NC), the early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), the late mild
   cognitive impairment (LMCI), and the AD. In this paper, 85 NC patients,
   70 EMCI, 70 LMCI, and 75 AD patients access form the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Tissue segmentation was applied
   on each subject to extract the gray matter (GM) tissue. In order to
   check the validity, the proposed method is tested on preprocessing data
   and achieved the highest rates of the classification accuracy on AD vs
   NC is 98.73\%, also distinguish between EMCI vs LMCI patients testing
   accuracy 83.72\%, whereas remaining classes accuracy is more than 80\%.
   Finally, we provide a comparative analysis with other studies which
   shows that the proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art models
   in terms of testing accuracy. (C) 2021 Published by Elsevier Ltd on

Title = {{Deep sparse graph functional connectivity analysis in AD patients using
   fMRI data}},
Journal = {{COMPUTER METHODS AND PROGRAMS IN BIOMEDICINE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method
   that helps to analyze brain func-tion based on BOLD signal fluctuations.
   Functional Connectivity (FC) catches the transient relationship between
   various brain regions usually measured by correlation analysis. The
   elements of the correlation matrix are between-1 to 1. Some of them are
   very small values usually related to weak and spurious correlations due
   to noises and artifacts. They can not be concluded as real strong
   correlations between brain regions and their existence could make a
   misconception and leads to fake results. It is crucial to make a
   conclusion based on reliable and informative correlations. In order to
   eliminate weak correla-tions, thresholding is a common method. In this
   routine, by adjusting a threshold the values below the threshold turn to
   zero and the rest remains. In this paper, in addition to thresholding,
   two other meth-ods including spectral sparsification based on Effective
   Resistance (ER) and autoencoders are investigated for sparsing the
   correlation matrices. Autoencoders are based on deep learning neural
   networks and ER considers the network as a resistive circuit. The fMRI
   data of the study correspond to Alzheimer \& rsquo;s pa-tients and
   control subjects. Graph global measures are calculated and a
   non-parametric permutation test is reported. Results show that the
   autoencoder and spectral sparsification achieved more distinctive brain
   graphs between healthy and AD subjects. Also, more graph global features
   were significantly different from these two methods due to better
   elimination of weak correlations and preserve more informa-tive ones.
   Regardless of the sparsification method features including average
   strength, clustering, local efficiency, modularity, and transitivity are
   significantly different (P-value= 0.05). On the other hand, the measures
   radius, diameter, and eccentricity showed no significant differences in
   none of the methods. In addition, according to three different methods,
   the brain regions show fragile and solid FCs are deter-mined.

Month = {{MAR 17}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer disease (AD) is mainly manifested as insidious onset, chronic
   progressive cognitive decline and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric
   symptoms, which seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly and
   causes a very large burden on society and families. This paper uses
   graph theory to analyze the constructed brain network, and extracts the
   node degree, node efficiency, and node betweenness centrality parameters
   of the two modal brain networks. The T test method is used to analyze
   the difference of graph theory parameters between normal people and AD
   patients, and brain regions with significant differences in graph theory
   parameters are selected as brain network features. By analyzing the
   calculation principles of the conventional convolutional layer and the
   depth separable convolution unit, the computational complexity of them
   is compared. The depth separable convolution unit decomposes the
   traditional convolution process into spatial convolution for feature
   extraction and point convolution for feature combination, which greatly
   reduces the number of multiplication and addition operations in the
   convolution process, while still being able to obtain comparisons.
   Aiming at the special convolution structure of the depth separable
   convolution unit, this paper proposes a channel pruning method based on
   the convolution structure and explains its pruning process. Multimodal
   neuroimaging can provide complete information for the quantification of
   Alzheimer's disease. This paper proposes a cascaded three-dimensional
   neural network framework based on single-modal and multi-modal images,
   using MRI and PET images to distinguish AD and MCI from normal samples.
   Multiple three-dimensional CNN networks are used to extract recognizable
   information in local image blocks. The high-level two-dimensional CNN
   network fuses multi-modal features and selects the features of
   discriminative regions to perform quantitative predictions on samples.
   The algorithm proposed in this paper can automatically extract and fuse
   the features of multi-modality and multi-regions layer by layer, and the
   visual analysis results show that the abnormally changed regions
   affected by Alzheimer's disease provide important information for
   clinical quantification.}},

Abstract = {{Background Generative adversarial networks (GAN) can produce images of

   performance. Methods T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 151 participants
   of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who underwent
   both 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) and 3-Tesla imaging at the same time were
   selected to construct a GAN model. This model was trained along with a
   three-dimensional fully convolutional network (FCN) using the generated
   images (3T{*}) as inputs to predict AD status. Quality of the generated
   images was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR),
   Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) and
   Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE). Cases from the Australian
   Imaging, Biomarker \& Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 107)
   and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 565) were
   used for model validation. Results The 3T{*}-based FCN classifier
   performed better than the FCN model trained using the 1.5-T scans.
   Specifically, the mean area under curve increased from 0.907 to 0.932,
   from 0.934 to 0.940, and from 0.870 to 0.907 on the ADNI test, AIBL, and

   quality of the generated (3T{*}) images was consistently higher than the
   1.5-T images, as measured using SNR, BRISQUE, and NIQE on the validation
   datasets. Conclusion This study demonstrates a proof of principle that

Abstract = {{Objective The present work was undertaken to study the genetic
   contribution to the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and
   tau biomarkers in cognitively intact older identical twins.
   Methods We studied in 96 monozygotic twin-pairs relationships between
   amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation as measured by the A beta 1-42/1-40
   ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission
   tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for A beta production
   (beta-secretase 1, A beta 1-40, and A beta 1-38) and CSF tau.
   Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating
   equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age,
   gender, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype. We used twin analyses
   to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental
   factors to AD pathophysiological processes.
   Results Twenty-seven individuals (14\%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and
   14 twin-pairs (15\%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within
   twin-pairs, A beta production markers and total-tau (t-tau) levels
   strongly correlated (r range = 0.73-0.86, all p < 0.0001), and A beta
   aggregation markers and 181-phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) levels correlated
   moderately strongly (r range = 0.50-0.64, all p < 0.0001). Cross-twin
   cross-trait analysis showed that A beta 1-38 in one twin correlated with
   A beta 1-42/1-40 ratios, and t-tau and p-tau levels in their cotwins (r
   range = -0.28 to 0.58, all p < .007). Within-pair differences in A beta
   production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range =
   0.49-0.61, all p < 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that A
   beta production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early
   AD.
   Interpretation Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared
   environmental background contributes to both A beta and tau increases,
   suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in
   delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021}},

Abstract = {{In this study, the anomaly analysis of Alzheimer's disease using
   positron emission tomography (PET) images using an unsupervised proposed
   adversarial model is investigated. The model consists of three parts: a
   parallel-network encoder, which is comprised of a convolutional pipeline
   and a dilated convolutional pipeline that extracts global and local
   features and concatenates them, a decoder that reconstructs the input
   image from the obtained feature vector, and a discriminator that
   distinguishes if the input image image is real or fake. The hypothesis
   is that if the proposed model is trained with only normal brain images,
   the corresponding construction loss for normal images should be minimal.
   However, if the input image belongs to a class that is designated as an
   anomaly that which the model is not trained with, then the construction
   loss will be high. This will reflect during the anomaly score comparison
   between the normal and the anomalous image. A multi-case analysis is
   performed for three major classes using the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive
   impairment, and normal control. The base parallel-encoder network shows
   better classification accuracy than the benchmark models, and the
   proposed model that is built on the parallel model outperforms the
   benchmark anomaly detection models. The proposed model gave out 96.03\%

Abstract = {{Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) is associated with devastating and
   irreversible cognitive decline. Predicting which patients with mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to DAT is an ongoing challenge
   in the field. We developed a deep learning model to predict conversion
   from MCI to DAT. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were used
   as input to a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network. The
   3-dimensional convolutional neural network was trained using transfer
   learning; in the source task, normal control and DAT scans were used to
   pretrain the model. This pretrained model was then retrained on the
   target task of classifying which MCI patients converted to DAT. Our
   model resulted in 82.4\% classification accuracy at the target task,
   outperforming current models in the field. Next, we visualized brain
   regions that significantly contribute to the prediction of MCI
   conversion using an occlusion map approach. Contributory regions
   included the pons, amygdala, and hippocampus. Finally, we showed that
   the model's prediction value is significantly correlated with rates of
   change in clinical assessment scores, indicating that the model is able
   to predict an individual patient's future cognitive decline. This

   learning framework was implemented to predict the ground-truth images of
   F-18-FBB PET/CT using short-time scans with either a single-slice or a
   3-slice input layer. Model performance was evaluated by quantitative and
   qualitative analyses. Additionally, we quantified the amyloid load in
   the ground-truth and predicted images using the SUV ratio. Results
   On quantitative analyses, with increasing scan time, the normalized
   root-mean-squared error and the SUV ratio differences between predicted
   and ground-truth images gradually decreased, and the peak
   signal-to-noise ratio increased. On qualitative analysis, the predicted
   images from the 3-slice CNN model showed better image quality than those
   from the single-slice model. The 3-slice CNN model with a short-time
   scan of at least 2 minutes achieved comparable, quantitative prediction
   of full-time F-18-FBB PET/CT images, with adequate to excellent image
   quality. Conclusions
   The 3-slice CNN model with a residual learning framework is promising
   for the prediction of full-time F-18-FBB PET/CT images from short-time
   scans.}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to generate the PET images with high
   signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) acquired for typical scan durations (H-PET)
   from short scan time PET images with low SNR (L-PET) using deep learning
   and to evaluate the effect of scan time on the quality of predicted PET
   image. A convolutional neural network (CNN) with a concatenated
   connection and residual learning framework was implemented. PET data
   from 27 patients were acquired for 900 s, starting 60 minutes after the
   intravenous administration of FDG using a commercial PET/CT scanner. To
   investigate the effect of scan time on the quality of the predicted
   H-PETs, 10 s, 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s PET data were generated by sorting
   the 900 s LMF data into the LMF data acquired for each scan time.
   Twenty-three of the 27 patient images were used for training of the
   proposed CNN and the remaining four patient images were used for test of
   the CNN. The predicted H-PETs generated by the CNN were compared to
   ground-truth H-PETs, L-PETS, and filtered L-PETS processed with four
   commonly used denoising algorithms. The peak signal-to-noise ratios
   (PSNRs), normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs), and average
   region-of-interest (ROI) differences as a function of scan time were
   calculated. The quality of the predicted H-PETs generated by the CNN was
   superior to that of the L-PETs and filtered L-PETs. Lower NRMSEs and
   higher PSNRs were also obtained from predicted H-PETs compared to the
   L-PETS and filtered L-PETS. ROI differences in the predicted H-PETs were
   smaller than those of the L-PETS. The quality of the predicted H-PETs
   gradually improved with increasing scan times. The lowest NRMSEs,
   highest PSNRs, and smallest ROI differences were obtained using the
   predicted H-PETs for 120 s. Various performance test results for the
   proposed CNN indicate that it is possible to generate H-PETs from neuro
   FDG L-PETS using the proposed CNN method, which might allow reductions
   in both scan time and injection dose.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder,
   accounting for nearly 60\% of all dementia cases. The occurrence of the
   disease has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Presently about
   46.8 million individuals suffer from AD worldwide. The current absence
   of effective treatment to reverse or stop AD progression highlights the
   importance of disease prevention and early diagnosis. Brain structural
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD detection
   as it can display morphometric differences and cerebral structural
   changes. In this study, we built three machine learning-based MRI data
   classifiers to predict AD and infer the brain regions that contribute to
   disease development and progression. We then systematically compared the
   three distinct classifiers, which were constructed based on Support
   Vector Machine (SVM), 3D Very Deep Convolutional Network (VGGNet) and 3D
   Deep Residual Network (ResNet), respectively. To improve the performance
   of the deep learning classifiers, we applied a transfer learning
   strategy. The weights of a pre-trained model were transferred and
   adopted as the initial weights of our models. Transferring the learned
   features significantly reduced training time and increased network
   efficiency. The classification accuracy for AD subjects from elderly
   control subjects was 90\%, 95\%, and 95\% for the SVM, VGGNet and ResNet
   classifiers, respectively. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping
   (Grad-CAM) was employed to show discriminative regions that contributed
   most to the AD dassification by utilizing the learned spatial
   information of the 3D-VGGNet and 3D-ResNet models. The resulted maps
   consistently highlighted several disease-associated brain regions,
   particularly the cerebellum which is a relatively neglected brain region
   in the present AD study. Overall, our comparisons suggested that the
   ResNet model provided the best classification performance as well as
   more accurate localization of disease-associated regions in the brain
   compared to the other two approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive disorders (MCI)
   studies use single data modality to make predictions such as AD stages.
   The fusion of multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD
   staging analysis. Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze
   imaging (magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide
   polymorphisms (SNPs)), and clinical test data to classify patients into
   AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use stacked denoising auto-encoders to
   extract features from clinical and genetic data, and use
   3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also
   develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing
   features learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation
   analysis. Using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI)
   dataset, we demonstrate that deep models outperform shallow models,
   including support vector machines, decision trees, random forests, and
   k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating
   multi-modality data outperforms single modality models in terms of
   accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models have
   identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory
   Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are
   consistent with the known AD literature.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose and aim: Detection of brain tumors plays a critical role in the
   treatment of patients. Before any treatment, tumor segmentation is
   crucial to protect healthy tissues during treatment and to destroy tumor

Abstract = {{Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease at early stage required an effective
   classification mechanism to differentiate mild cognitive impairment from
   cognitive normal and AD. In this paper, we used data set collected from

   informative slices are selected using entropy. The selected slices are
   pre-processed by removing unwanted tissues using skull stripping
   algorithm and extracted gray matter using EICA. In this work, we used
   CNN model with inception blocks to extract deep features from the GM
   slices used to predict AD at early stage. The model avoids data leakage
   by considering all the slices of an MRI as a unit. The model trained
   with 80\% of ADNI subject MRI volumes and tested with the remaining 20\%
   subject MRI volumes, to provide great variance in training and testing

Abstract = {{There are many kinds of brain abnormalities that cause changes in
   different parts of the brain. Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition
   that degenerates the cells of the brain leading to memory asthenia.
   Cognitive mental troubles such as forgetfulness and confusion are one of
   the most important features of Alzheimer's patients. In the literature,
   several image processing techniques, as well as machine learning
   strategies, were introduced for the diagnosis of the disease. This study
   is aimed at recognizing the presence of Alzheimer's disease based on the
   magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. We adopted a deep learning
   methodology for the discrimination between Alzheimer's patients and
   healthy patients from 2D anatomical slices collected using magnetic
   resonance imaging. Most of the previous researches were based on the
   implementation of a 3D convolutional neural network, whereas we
   incorporated the usage of 2D slices as input to the convolutional neural
   network. The data set of this research was obtained from the OASIS
   website. We trained the convolutional neural network structure using the
   2D slices to exhibit the deep network weightings that we named as the
   Alzheimer Network (AlzNet). The accuracy of our enhanced network was
   99.30\%. This work investigated the effects of many parameters on

Journal = {{HELIYON}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Hippocampus segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging is of
   key importance for the diagnosis, treatment decision and investigation
   of neuropsychiatric disorders. Automatic segmentation is an active
   research field, with many recent models using deep learning. Most
   current state-of-the art hippocampus segmentation methods train their
   methods on healthy or Alzheimer's disease patients from public datasets.
   This raises the question whether these methods are capable of
   recognizing the hippocampus on a different domain, that of epilepsy
   patients with hippocampus resection.
   New Method: In this paper we present a state-of-the-art, open source,
   ready-to-use, deep learning based hippocampus segmentation method. It
   uses an extended 2D multi-orientation approach, with automatic
   preprocessing and orientation alignment. The methodology was developed
   and validated using HarP, a public Alzheimer's disease hippocampus
   segmentation dataset.
   Results and Comparisons: We test this methodology alongside other recent
   deep learning methods, in two domains: The HarP test set and an in-house
   epilepsy dataset, containing hippocampus resections, named HCUnicamp. We
   show that our method, while trained only in HarP, surpasses others from
   the literature in both the HarP test set and HCUnicamp in Dice.
   Additionally, Results from training and testing in HCUnicamp volumes are
   also reported separately, alongside comparisons between training and
   testing in epilepsy and Alzheimer's data and vice versa.
   Conclusion: Although current state-of-the-art methods, including our
   own, achieve upwards of 0.9 Dice in HarP, all tested methods, including
   our own, produced false positives in HCUnicamp resection regions,
   showing that there is still room for improvement for hippocampus
   segmentation methods when resection is involved.}},

Abstract = {{Effective and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as

   detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using Polar Harmonic Transforms
   (PHT) and Self-adaptive Differential Evolution Wavelet Neural Network
   (SaDE-WNN). The orthogonal moments are used for feature extraction from
   the grey matter tissues of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

   through evaluating the in-class and among-class variance. In recent
   years, WNNs have gained attention in classification tasks; however, they
   suffer from the problem of initial parameter tuning, parameter setting.
   We proposed a WNN with the self-adaptation technique for controlling the
   Differential Evolution (DE) parameters, i.e., the mutation scale factor
   (F) and the cross-over rate (CR). Experimental results on the

Abstract = {{Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is
   considered essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may
   involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as
   changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right
   hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and
   used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early
   mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can
   help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper
   proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity
   hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of
   the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the
   analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of
   the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing
   between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or

   belonged to ``other{''} category. In oncology, the studies aimed at
   detection, diagnosis, and prognostication of cancer. In neurology, the
   majority of the studies aimed at diagnosing Alzheimer Disease and
   stratification of the risk. CNN-based algorithms demonstrated promising
   results with performances equal or even higher compared to conventional
   approaches. Discussion Overall, CNN applications for PET/CT and PET/MR
   are exponentially growing, demonstrating encouraging results for both

Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have
   overlapping symptoms, and accurate differential diagnosis is important
   for targeted intervention and treatment. Previous studies suggest that
   the deep learning (DL) techniques have the potential to solve the
   differential diagnosis problem of FTD, AD and normal controls (NCs), but
   its performance is still unclear. In addition, existing DL-assisted
   diagnostic studies still rely on hypothesis-based expert-level
   preprocessing. On the one hand, it imposes high requirements on
   clinicians and data themselves; On the other hand, it hinders the
   backtracking of classification results to the original image data,
   resulting in the classification results cannot be interpreted
   intuitively. In the current study, a large cohort of 3D T1-weighted
   structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes (n = 4,099) was
   collected from two publicly available databases, i.e., the ADNI and the
   NIFD. We trained a DL-based network directly based on raw T1 images to
   classify FTD, AD and corresponding NCs. And we evaluated the convergence
   speed, differential diagnosis ability, robustness and generalizability
   under nine scenarios. The proposed network yielded an accuracy of
   91.83\% based on the most common T1-weighted sequence
   {[}magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo
   (MPRAGE)]. The knowledge learned by the DL network through multiple
   classification tasks can also be used to solve subproblems, and the
   knowledge is generalizable and not limited to a specified dataset.
   Furthermore, we applied a gradient visualization algorithm based on
   guided backpropagation to calculate the contribution graph, which tells
   us intuitively why the DL-based networks make each decision. The regions
   making valuable contributions to FTD were more widespread in the right
   frontal white matter regions, while the left temporal, bilateral
   inferior frontal and parahippocampal regions were contributors to the
   classification of AD. Our results demonstrated that DL-based networks
   have the ability to solve the enigma of differential diagnosis of
   diseases without any hypothesis-based preprocessing. Moreover, they may
   mine the potential patterns that may be different from human clinicians,
   which may provide new insight into the understanding of FTD and AD.}},

Title = {{Differentiating Dementia with Lewy Bodies and Alzheimer's Disease by
   Deep Learning to Structural MRI}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING}},
Abstract = {{Background and Purpose: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second
   most prevalent cause of degenerative dementia next to Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Though current DLB diagnostic criteria employ several
   indicative biomarkers, relative preservation of the medial temporal lobe
   as revealed by structural MRI suffers from low sensitivity and
   specificity, making them unreliable as sole supporting biomarkers. In
   this study, we investigated how a deep learning approach would be able
   to differentiate DLB from AD with structural MRI data.
   Methods: Two-hundred and eight patients (101 DLB, 69 AD, and 38
   controls) participated in this retrospective study. Gray matter images
   were extracted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In order to compare
   the conventional statistical analysis with deep-learning feature
   extraction, we built a classification model for DLB and AD with a
   residual neural network (ResNet) type of convolutional neural network
   architecture, which is one of the deep learning models. The anatomically
   standardized gray matter images extracted in the same way as for the VBM
   process were used as inputs, and the classification performance achieved
   by our model was evaluated.
   Results: Conventional statistical analysis detected no significant
   atrophy other than fine differences on the middle temporal pole and
   hippocampal regions. The feature extracted by the deep learning method
   differentiated DLB from AD with 79.15\% accuracy compared to the 68.41\%
   of the conventional method.
   Conclusions: Our results confirmed that the deep learning method with
   gray matter images can detect fine differences between DLB and AD that
   may be underestimated by the conventional method.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, interest has grown in using computer-aided diagnosis
   (CAD) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI). However, existing CAD technologies often
   overfit data and have poor generalizability. In this study, we proposed
   a sparse-response deep belief network (SR-DBN) model based on rate
   distortion (RD) theory and an extreme learning machine (ELM) model to
   distinguish AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC). We used {[}F-18]-AV45
   positron emission computed tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) images from 340 subjects enrolled in the ADNI database,
   including 116 AD, 82 MCI, and 142 NC subjects. The model was evaluated
   using five-fold cross-validation. In the whole model, fast principal
   component analysis (PCA) served as a dimension reduction algorithm. An
   SR-DBN extracted features from the images, and an ELM obtained the
   classification. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of our
   method, we performed comparative trials. In contrast experiment 1, the
   ELM was replaced by a support vector machine (SVM). Contrast experiment
   2 adopted DBN without sparsity. Contrast experiment 3 consisted of fast
   PCA and an ELM. Contrast experiment 4 used a classic convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to classify AD. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
   and area under the curve (AUC) were examined to validate the results.
   Our model achieved 91.68\% accuracy, 95.47\% sensitivity, 86.68\%
   specificity, and an AUC of 0.87 separating between AD and NC groups;
   87.25\% accuracy, 79.74\% sensitivity, 91.58\% specificity, and an AUC
   of 0.79 separating MCI and NC groups; and 80.35\% accuracy, 85.65\%
   sensitivity, 72.98\% specificity, and an AUC of 0.71 separating AD and
   MCI groups, which gave better classification than other models assessed.}},

Abstract = {{The detailed anatomical information of the brain provided by 3D magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) enables various neuroscience research. However,
   due to the long scan time for 3D MR images, 2D images are mainly
   obtained in clinical environments. The purpose of this study is to
   generate 3D images from a sparsely sampled 2D images using an inpainting
   deep neural network that has a U-net-like structure and DenseNet
   sub-blocks. To train the network, not only fidelity loss but also
   perceptual loss based on the VGG network were considered. Various
   methods were used to assess the overall similarity between the inpainted
   and original 3D data. In addition, morphological analyzes were performed
   to investigate whether the inpainted data produced local features
   similar to the original 3D data. The diagnostic ability using the
   inpainted data was also evaluated by investigating the pattern of
   morphological changes in disease groups. Brain anatomy details were
   efficiently recovered by the proposed neural network. In voxel-based
   analysis to assess gray matter volume and cortical thickness,
   differences between the inpainted data and the original 3D data were
   observed only in small clusters. The proposed method will be useful for
   utilizing advanced neuroimaging techniques with 2D MRI data.}},

   pathophysiological profiles across dementia subtypes: A multicenter
   study}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{225}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{From molecular mechanisms to global brain networks, atypical
   fluctuations are the hallmark of neurodegeneration. Yet, traditional
   fMRI research on resting-state networks (RSNs) has favored static and
   average connectivity methods, which by overlooking the fluctuation
   dynamics triggered by neurodegeneration, have yielded inconsistent
   results. The present multicenter study introduces a data-driven machine
   learning pipeline based on dynamic connectivity fluctuation analysis
   (DCFA) on RS-fMRI data from 300 participants belonging to three groups:
   behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) patients, and healthy controls. We considered non-linear
   oscillatory patterns across combined and individual resting-state
   networks (RSNs), namely: the salience network (SN), mostly affected in
   bvFTD; the default mode network (DMN), mostly affected in AD; the
   executive network (EN), partially compromised in both conditions; the
   motor network (MN); and the visual network (VN). These RSNs were entered
   as features for dementia classification using a recent robust machine
   learning approach (a Bayesian hyperparameter tuned Gradient Boosting
   Machines (GBM) algorithm), across four independent datasets with
   different MR scanners and recording parameters. The machine learning
   classification accuracy analysis revealed a systematic and unique
   tailored architecture of RSN disruption. The classification accuracy
   ranking showed that the most affected networks for bvFTD were the SN +
   EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.43\%, AUC = 0.91, sensitivity =
   86.45\%, specificity = 87.54\%); for AD, the DMN + EN network pair (mean
   accuracy = 86.63\%, AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 88.37\%, specificity =
   84.62\%); and for the bvFTD vs. AD classification, the DMN + SN network
   pair (mean accuracy = 82.67\%, AUC = 0.86, sensitivity = 81.27\%,
   specificity = 83.01\%). Moreover, the DFCA classification systematically
   outperformed canonical connectivity approaches (including both static
   and linear dynamic connectivity). Our findings suggest that nonlinear
   dynamical fluctuations surpass two traditional seed-based functional
   connectivity approaches and provide a pathophysiological
   characterization of global brain networks in neurodegenerative
   conditions (AD and bvFTD) across multicenter data.}},

Abstract = {{Recent critical commentaries unfavorably compare deep learning (DL) with

   We conduct a large-scale systematic comparison profiled in multiple

Abstract = {{MRI studies have provided valuable insights into the structure and
   function of neural networks, particularly in health and in classical
   neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer disease. However, such
   work is also highly relevant in other diseases of the CNS, including
   multiple sclerosis (MS). In this Review, we consider the effects of MS
   pathology on brain networks, as assessed using MRI, and how these
   changes to brain networks translate into clinical impairments. We also
   discuss how this knowledge can inform the targeting of MS treatments and
   the potential future directions for research in this area. Studying MS
   is challenging as its pathology involves neurodegenerative and focal
   inflammatory elements, both of which could disrupt neural networks. The
   disruption of white matter tracts in MS is reflected in changes in
   network efficiency, an increasingly random grey matter network topology,
   relative cortical disconnection, and both increases and decreases in
   connectivity centred around hubs such as the thalamus and the default
   mode network. The results of initial longitudinal studies suggest that

Title = {{True ultra-low-dose amyloid PET/MRI enhanced with deep learning for

Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Abstract = {{Purpose While sampled or short-frame realizations have shown the
   potential power of deep learning to reduce radiation dose for PET
   images, evidence in true injected ultra-low-dose cases is lacking.
   Therefore, we evaluated deep learning enhancement using a significantly
   reduced injected radiotracer protocol for amyloid PET/MRI.
   Methods Eighteen participants underwent two separate F-18-florbetaben
   PET/MRI studies in which an ultra-low-dose (6.64 +/- 3.57 MBq, 2.2 +/-
   1.3\% of standard) or a standard-dose (300 +/- 14 MBq) was injected. The
   PET counts from the standard-dose list-mode data were also undersampled
   to approximate an ultra-low-dose session. A pre-trained convolutional
   neural network was fine-tuned using MR images and either the injected or
   sampled ultra-low-dose PET as inputs. Image quality of the enhanced
   images was evaluated using three metrics (peak signal-to-noise ratio,
   structural similarity, and root mean square error), as well as the
   coefficient of variation (CV) for regional standard uptake value ratios
   (SUVRs). Mean cerebral uptake was correlated across image types to
   assess the validity of the sampled realizations. To judge clinical
   performance, four trained readers scored image quality on a five-point
   scale (using 15\% non-inferiority limits for proportion of studies rated
   3 or better) and classified cases into amyloid-positive and negative
   studies.
   Results The deep learning-enhanced PET images showed marked improvement
   on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose images as well as
   having generally similar regional CVs as the standard-dose. All enhanced
   images were non-inferior to their standard-dose counterparts. Accuracy
   for amyloid status was high (97.2\% and 91.7\% for images enhanced from
   injected and sampled ultra-low-dose data, respectively) which was
   similar to intra-reader reproducibility of standard-dose images
   (98.6\%).
   Conclusion Deep learning methods can synthesize diagnostic-quality PET
   images from ultra-low injected dose simultaneous PET/MRI data,
   demonstrating the general validity of sampled realizations and the
   potential to reduce dose significantly for amyloid imaging.}},

Title = {{Improved amyloid burden quantification with nonspecific estimates using
   deep learning}},
Journal = {{EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING}},
Abstract = {{Purpose Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) used to quantify
   amyloid-beta burden from amyloid-PET scans can be biased by variations
   in the tracer's nonspecific (NS) binding caused by the presence of
   cerebrovascular disease (CeVD). In this work, we propose a novel
   amyloid-PET quantification approach that harnesses the intermodal image
   translation capability of convolutional networks to remove this
   undesirable source of variability.
   Methods Paired MR and PET images exhibiting very low specific uptake
   were selected from a Singaporean amyloid-PET study involving 172
   participants with different severities of CeVD. Two convolutional neural
   networks (CNN), ScaleNet and HighRes3DNet, and one conditional
   generative adversarial network (cGAN) were trained to map structural MR
   to NS PET images. NS estimates generated for all subjects using the most
   promising network were then subtracted from SUVr images to determine
   specific amyloid load only (SA beta(L)). Associations of SA beta(L) with
   various cognitive and functional test scores were then computed and
   compared to results using conventional SUVr.
   Results Multimodal ScaleNet outperformed other networks in predicting
   the NS content in cortical gray matter with a mean relative error below
   2\%. Compared to SUVr, SA beta(L) showed increased association with
   cognitive and functional test scores by up to 67\%.
   Conclusion Removing the undesirable NS uptake from the amyloid load
   measurement is possible using deep learning and substantially improves
   its accuracy. This novel analysis approach opens a new window of
   opportunity for improved data modeling in Alzheimer's disease and for
   other neurodegenerative diseases that utilize PET imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Brain tumor represents one of the most fatal cancers around the world.
   It is common cancer in adults and children. It has the lowest survival
   rate and various types depending on their location, texture, and shape.
   The wrong classification of the tumor brain will lead to bad
   consequences. Consequently, identifying the correct type and grade of
   tumor in the early stages has an important role to choose a precise
   treatment plan. Examining the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of
   the patient's brain represents an effective technique to distinguish
   brain tumors. Due to the big amounts of data and the various brain tumor
   types, the manual technique becomes time-consuming and can lead to human
   errors. Therefore, an automated computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) system
   is required. The recent evolution in image classification techniques has
   shown great progress especially the deep convolution neural networks
   (CNNs) which have succeeded in this area. In this regard, we exploited
   CNN for the problem of brain tumor classification. We suggested a new
   model, which contains various layers in the aim to classify MRI brain
   tumor. The proposed model is experimentally evaluated on three datasets.
   Experimental results affirm that the suggested approach provides a
   convincing performance compared to existing methods.}},

Title = {{Deep Learning-Based Segmentation in Classification of Alzheimer's
   Disease}},
Journal = {{ARABIAN JOURNAL FOR SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING}},
Abstract = {{The classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using ADNI dataset
   requires suitable feature segmenting techniques to detect the existing
   and relevant finer smaller brain region features, together with
   effective classification model, to eliminate a massive, labor-intensive
   and time-consuming voxel-based morphometry technique. Here, in this
   paper, a deep learning-based segmenting method using SegNet to detect AD
   pertinent brain parts features from structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (sMRI) and subsequently classifying accurately AD and dementia
   condition using ResNet-101 is presented. A deep learning-based image
   segmenting approach is experimented in detecting the delicate features
   of brain morphological changes due to AD that benefits classification
   performance for cognitive normal, mild cognitive impairment and AD, and
   thus provides an easy automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases. For
   classification, ResNet-101 is trained applying features extracted from
   SegNet with ADNI dataset. This paper demonstrated particularly to attain
   top-level automated classification. The seven morphological features
   like grey matter, white matter, cortex surface, gyri and sulci contour,
   cortex thickness, hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid space extracted
   from 240 sMRI with SegNet are used to train ResNet for classification,
   and this classifier achieved a sensitivity of 96\% and an accuracy of
   95\% over 240 ADNI sMRI other than used for training.}},

Title = {{Hippocampal shape and asymmetry analysis by cascaded convolutional
   neural networks for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis}},
Journal = {{BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR}},
Abstract = {{Hippocampal atrophy is often considered as one of the important
   biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is an
   irreversible neurodegenerative disorder. Traditional methods for
   hippocampus analysis usually computed the shape and volume features from
   structural Magnetic Resonance Image (sMRI) for the computer-aided
   diagnosis of AD as well as its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI). Motivated by the success of deep learning, this paper
   proposes a deep learning method with the multi-channel cascaded
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn the combined
   hierarchical representations of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries from
   the binary hippocampal masks for AD classification. First, image
   segmentation is performed to generate the bilateral hippocampus binary
   masks for each subject and the mask difference is obtained by
   subtracting them. Second, multi-channel 3D CNNs are individually
   constructed on the hippocampus masks and mask differences to extract
   features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries for classification.
   Third, a 2D CNN is cascaded on the 3D CNNs to learn high-level
   correlation features. Finally, the features learned by multi-channel and
   cascaded CNNs are combined with a fully connected layer followed by a
   softmax classifier for disease classification. The proposed method can
   gradually learn the combined hierarchical features of hippocampal shapes
   and asymmetries to enhance the classification. Our method is verified on
   the baseline sMRIs from 807 subjects including 194 AD patients, 397 MCI
   (164 progressive MCI (pMCI) + 233 stable MCI (sMCI)), and 216 normal
   controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method
   achieves an AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of 88.4\%, 74.6\% and 71.9\%
   for AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI classifications,
   respectively. It proves the promising classification performance and
   also shows that both hippocampal shape and asymmetry are helpful for AD
   diagnosis.}},

Title = {{Blinded Clinical Evaluation for Dementia of Alzheimer's Type
   Classification Using FDG-PET: A Comparison Between Feature-Engineered
   and Non-Feature-Engineered Machine Learning Methods}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2021}},

Pages = {{715-726}},
Abstract = {{Background: Advanced machine learning methods can aid in the
   identification of dementia risk using neuroimaging-derived features
   including FDG-PET. However, to enable the translation of these methods
   and test their usefulness in clinical practice, it is crucial to conduct
   independent validation on real clinical samples, which has yet to be
   properly delineated in the current literature.
   Objective: In this paper, we present our efforts to enable such clinical
   translational through the evaluation and comparison of two
   machine-learning methods for discrimination between dementia of
   Alzheimer's type (DAT) and Non-DAT controls.
   Methods: FDG-PET-based dementia scores were generated on an independent
   clinical sample whose clinical diagnosis was blinded to the algorithm
   designers. A feature-engineered approach (multi-kernel probability
   classifier) and a non-feature-engineered approach (3D convolutional
   neural network) were analyzed. Both classifiers were pre-trained on
   cognitively normal subjects as well as subjects with DAT. These two
   methods provided a probabilistic dementia score for this previously
   unseen clinical data. Performance of the algorithms were compared
   against ground-truth dementia rating assessed by experienced nuclear
   physicians.
   Results: Blinded clinical evaluation on both classifiers showed good
   separation between the cognitively normal subjects and the patients
   diagnosed with DAT. The non-feature-engineered dementia score showed
   higher sensitivity among subjects whose diagnosis was in agreement
   between the machine-learning models, while the feature-engineered
   approach showed higher specificity in non-consensus cases.
   Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated blinded evaluation using data
   from an independent clinical sample for assessing the performance in DAT
   classification models in a clinical setting. Our results showed good
   generalizability for two machine-learning approaches, marking an
   important step for the translation of pre-trained machine-learning
   models into clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer is a progressive disease and it is the most prevalent
   neurodegenerative disorder. It is believed that the people with mild
   cognitive impairment are at high risk of developing this disease.
   According to the annual report released by the Alzheimer's Association
   (R) 2020, Alzheimer is the sixth leading cause of death in the United
   States. Thus, there is a need of educating people about this disease,
   reducing the risks by militating the necessary precautions to
   disseminate its affect by diagnosing it at early stages. It is also
   important to propose some recent advancement in this research which can
   help in early prediction of the disease using machine learning
   techniques. This paper intends to develop the novel algorithm by
   proposing changes in the designing of capsule network for best
   prediction results and making the model computationally efficient. The
   research is conducted on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies
   (OASIS) dataset with dimensions (373 X 15) to diagnose the labels into
   two groups, as demented and non-demented. The novelty lies in conducting
   the in-depth research in identifying the importance of features,
   correlation study between factors and density of data showing status of
   factors by studying hierarchical examination of all the data points
   available using exploratory data analysis. Several optimization
   functions are conducted on the variables and feature selection is done
   to make the model faster and more accurate. The claims have been
   validated by showing the correlation accuracy at several iterations and
   layers with an admissible accuracy of 92.39\%. The model is compared
   with state-of-art deep learning classifiers taken as benchmarks using
   different performance metrics. The ablation study is conducted on the

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{9}},
Pages = {{33313-33322}},
Abstract = {{The unprecedented improvements in computing capabilities and the
   introduction of advanced techniques for the analysis, interpretation,
   processing, and visualization of images have greatly diversified the
   domain of medical sciences and resulted in the field of medical imaging.
   The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an advanced imaging technique, is
   capable of producing high quality images of the human body including the
   brain for diagnosis purposes. This paper proposes a simple but efficient
   solution for the classification of MRI brain images into normal, and
   abnormal images containing disorders and injuries. It uses images with
   brain tumor, acute stroke and alzheimer, besides normal images, from the
   public dataset developed by harvard medical school, for evaluation
   purposes. The proposed model is a four step process, in which the steps
   are named: 1). Pre-processing, 2). Features Extraction, 3). Features
   Reduction, and 4). Classification. Median filter, being one of the best
   algorithms, is used for the removal of noise such as salt and pepper,
   and unwanted components such as scalp and skull, in the pre-processing
   step. During this stage, the images are converted from gray scale to
   colored images for further processing. In second step, it uses Discrete
   Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique to extract different features from the
   images. In third stage, Color Moments (CMs) are used to reduce the
   number of features and get an optimal set of characteristics. Images
   with the optimal set of features are passed to different classifiers for
   the classification of images. The Feed Forward - ANN (FF-ANN), an
   individual classifier, which was given a 65\% to 35\% split ratio for
   training and testing, and hybrid classifiers called: Random Subspace
   with Random Forest (RSwithRF) and Random Subspace with Bayesian Network
   (RSwithBN), which used 10-Fold cross validation technique, resulted in
   95.83\%, 97.14\% and 95.71\% accurate classification, in corresponding
   order. These promising results show that the proposed method is robust
   and efficient, in comparison with, existing classification methods in
   terms of accuracy with smaller number of optimal features.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Pages = {{41998-42012}},
Abstract = {{Dynamic positron emission tomography (PET) imaging usually suffers from
   high statistical noise due to low counts of the short frames. This study
   aims to improve the image quality of the short frames by utilizing
   information from other modality. We develop a deep learning-based joint
   filtering framework for simultaneously incorporating information from
   longer acquisition PET frames and high-resolution magnetic resonance
   (MR) images into the short frames. The network inputs are noisy PET
   images and corresponding MR images while the outputs are linear
   coefficients of spatially variant linear representation model. The
   composite of all dynamic frames is used as training label in each
   sample, and it is down-sampled to 1/10th of counts as the training
   input. L1-norm combined with two gradient-based regularizations
   constitute the loss function during training. Ten realistic dynamic
   PET/MR phantoms based on BrainWeb are used for pre-training and eleven
   clinical subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
   further for fine-tuning. Simulation results show that the proposed
   method can reduce the statistical noise while preserving image details
   and achieve quantitative enhancements compared with Gaussian, guided
   filter, and convolutional neural network trained with the mean squared
   error. The clinical results perform better than others in terms of the
   mean activity and standard deviation. All of the results indicate that
   the proposed deep learning-based joint filtering framework is of great
   potential for dynamic PET image denoising.}},

   functions and regional patterns of atrophy and functional connectivity
   in the Alzheimer's disease spectrum}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{29}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive decline has been found to be associated with gray
   matter atrophy and disruption of functional neural networks in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) in structural and functional imaging (fMRI)
   studies. Most previous studies have used single test scores of cognitive
   performance among monocentric cohorts. However, cognitive domain
   composite scores could be more reliable than single test scores due to
   the reduction of measurement error. Adopting a multicentric resting
   state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and cognitive domain approach, we provide a
   comprehensive description of the structural and functional correlates of
   the key cognitive domains of AD.
   Method: We analyzed MRI, rs-fMRI and cognitive domain score data of 490
   participants from an interim baseline release of the multicenter DELCODE
   study cohort, including 54 people with AD, 86 with Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI), 175 with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), and 175
   Healthy Controls (HC) in the AD-spectrum. Resulting cognitive domain
   composite scores (executive, visuo-spatial, memory, working memory and
   language) from the DELCODE neuropsychological battery (DELCODE-NP), were
   previously derived using confirmatory factor analysis. Statistical
   analyses examined the differences between diagnostic groups, and the
   association of composite scores with regional atrophy and
   network-specific functional connectivity among the patient subgroup of
   SCD, MCI and AD.
   Result: Cognitive performance, atrophy patterns and functional
   connectivity significantly differed between diagnostic groups in the
   AD-spectrum. Regional gray matter atrophy was positively associated with
   visuospatial and other cognitive impairments among the patient subgroup
   in the AD-spectrum. Except for the visual network, patterns of
   network-specific resting-state functional connectivity were positively
   associated with distinct cognitive impairments among the patient
   subgroup in the AD-spectrum.
   Conclusion: Consistent associations between cognitive domain scores and
   both regional atrophy and networkspecific functional connectivity
   (except for the visual network), support the utility of a multicentric
   and cognitive domain approach towards explicating the relationship
   between imaging markers and cognition in the AD-spectrum.}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Effective detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still

   OBJECTIVE: To investigate and test a new detection model aiming to help

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
   that is mostly prevalent in people older than 65 years. The hippocampus
   is a widely studied region of interest (ROI) for a number of reasons,
   such as memory function analysis, stress development observation and
   neurological disorder investigation. Moreover, hippocampal volume
   atrophy is known to be linked with Alzheimer's disease. On the other
   hand, several biomarkers, such as amyloid beta (a beta(42)) protein,
   tau, phosphorylated tau and hippocampal volume atrophy, are being used
   to diagnose AD. In this research work, we have proposed a method to
   diagnose AD based on slice-wise volumetric features extracted from the
   left and right hippocampi of structural magnetic resonance imaging
   (sMRI) data. The proposed method is an aggregation of a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) model with a deep neural network (DNN) model. The
   left and right hippocampi have been localized automatically using a
   two-stage ensemble Hough-CNN. The localized hippocampal positions are
   used to extract (80 x 80x80 voxels) 3-D patches. The 2-D slices are then
   separated from the 3-D patches along axial, sagittal, and coronal views.
   The pre-processed 2-D patches are used to extract volumetric features
   from each slice by using a discrete volume estimation convolutional
   neural network (DVE-CNN) model. The extracted volumetric features have
   been used to train and test the classification network. The proposed
   approach has achieved average weighted classification accuracies of
   94.82\% and 94.02\% based on the extracted volumetric features
   attributed to the left and right hippocampi, respectively. In addition,
   it has achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 92.54\% and 90.62\%
   for the left and right hippocampi, respectively. Our method has
   outperformed the other methods by a certain margin in the same dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and automated reconstruction of the in vivo human cerebral
   cortical surface from anatomical magnetic resonance (MR) images
   facilitates the quantitative analysis of cortical structure. Anatomical
   MR images with sub-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution improve the
   accuracy of cortical surface and thickness estimation compared to the
   standard 1-millimeter isotropic resolution. Nonetheless, sub-millimeter
   resolution acquisitions require averaging multiple repetitions to
   achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and are therefore long and
   potentially vulnerable to subject motion. We address this challenge by
   synthesizing sub-millimeter resolution images from standard 1-millimeter
   isotropic resolution images using a data-driven supervised machine
   learning-based super-resolution approach achieved via a deep
   convolutional neural network. We systematically characterize our
   approach using a large-scale simulated dataset and demonstrate its
   efficacy in empirical data. The super-resolution data provide improved
   cortical surfaces similar to those obtained from native sub-millimeter
   resolution data. The whole-brain mean absolute discrepancy in cortical
   surface positioning and thickness estimation is below 100 mu m at the
   single-subject level and below 50 mu m at the group level for the
   simulated data, and below 200 mu m at the single-subject level and below
   100 mu m at the group level for the empirical data, making the accuracy
   of cortical surfaces derived from super-resolution sufficient for most
   applications.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This retrospective and exploratory study tested the accuracy
   of artificial neural networks (ANNs) at detecting Alzheimer's disease
   patients with dementia (ADD) based on input variables extracted from
   resting-state electroencephalogram (rsEEG), structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (sMRI) or both.
   Methods: For the classification exercise, the ANNs had two architectures
   that included stacked (autoencoding) hidden layers recreating input data
   in the output. The classification was based on LORETA source estimates
   from rsEEG activity recorded with 10-20 montage system (19 electrodes)
   and standard sMRI variables in 89 ADD and 45 healthy control
   participants taken from a national database.
   Results: The ANN with stacked autoencoders and a deep leaning model
   representing both ADD and control participants showed classification
   accuracies in discriminating them of 80\%, 85\%, and 89\% using rsEEG,
   sMRI, and rsEEG + sMRI features, respectively. The two ANNs with stacked
   autoencoders and a deep leaning model specialized for either ADD or
   control participants showed classification accuracies of 77\%, 83\%, and
   86\% using the same input features.
   Conclusions: The two architectures of ANNs using stacked (autoencoding)
   hidden layers consistently reached moderate to high accuracy in the
   discrimination between ADD and healthy control participants as a
   function of the rsEEG and sMRI features employed.
   Significance: The present results encourage future multi-centric,
   prospective and longitudinal cross validation studies using high
   resolution EEG techniques and harmonized clinical procedures towards
   clinical applications of the present ANNs. (C) 2020 International

Abstract = {{Background: In recent years, many convolutional neural networks (CNN)
   have been proposed for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. Due to
   memory constraints, many of the proposed CNNs work at a 2D slice-level
   or 3D patch-level.
   Objective: Here, we propose a subject-level 3D CNN that can extract the
   neurodegenerative patterns of the whole brain MRI and converted into a
   probabilistic Dementia score.
   Methods: We propose an efficient and lightweight subject-level 3D CNN
   featuring dilated convolutions. We trained our network on the ADNI data
   on stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) from stable normal
   controls (sNC). To comprehensively evaluate the generalizability of our
   proposed network, we performed four independent tests which includes
   testing on images from other ADNI individuals at various stages of the
   dementia, images acquired from other sites (AIBL), images acquired using
   different protocols (OASIS), and longitudinal images acquired over a
   short period of time (MIRIAD).
   Results: We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated balanced accuracy of 88\%
   in differentiating sDAT from sNC, and an overall specificity of 79.5\%
   and sensitivity 79.7\% on the entire set of 7,902 independent test
   images.
   Conclusion: Independent testing is essential for estimating the
   generalization ability of the network to unseen data, but is often
   lacking in studies using CNN for DAT classification. This makes it
   difficult to compare the performances achieved using different
   architectures. Our comprehensive evaluation highlighting the competitive

Abstract = {{Cerebral Microbleeds (CMBs) are microhemorrhages caused by certain

   can be highly dangerous for individuals having dementia and stroke. The
   CMBs seriously impact individuals' life which makes it crucial to
   recognize the CMBs in its initial phase to stop deterioration and to
   assist individuals to have a normal life. The existing work report good
   results but often ignores false-positive's perspective for this research
   area. In this paper, an efficient approach is presented to detect CMBs

   extraction specific to CMBs (iv) classification using a five layers

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD), one of the main causes of death in elderly
   people, is characterized by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at prodromal
   stage. Nevertheless, only part of MCI subjects could progress to AD. The
   main objective of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop
   a dementia of AD type among MCI patients. F-18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose
   Positron Emission Tomography (F-18-FDG PET) serves as a neuroimaging
   modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect neural activity via
   measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we design a
   deep network on F-18-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD
   identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable
   Pyramid Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are
   learned from axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to
   offer complementary information and then combined to make a decision
   jointly. Different from the widely and naturally used 3D convolution
   operations for 3D images, the proposed architecture is deployed with
   separable convolution from slice-wise to spatial-wise successively,
   which can retain the spatial information and reduce training parameters
   compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively. Experiments on ADNI
   dataset show that the proposed method can yield better performance than
   both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for predicting the
   progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment, with a classification accuracy
   of 83.05\%.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease
   causing dementia and poses significant health risks to middle-aged and
   elderly people. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most
   widely used diagnostic method for AD. However, it is challenging to
   collect sufficient brain imaging data with high-quality annotations.
   Weakly supervised learning (WSL) is a machine learning technique aimed
   at learning effective feature representation from limited or low-quality
   annotations. In this paper, we propose a WSL-based deep learning (DL)
   framework (ADGNET) consisting of a backbone network with an attention
   mechanism and a task network for simultaneous image classification and
   image reconstruction to identify and classify AD using limited
   annotations. The ADGNET achieves excellent performance based on six
   evaluation metrics (Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, precision,
   accuracy, F1-score) on two brain MRI datasets (2D MRI and 3D MRI data)
   using fine-tuning with only 20\% of the labels from both datasets. The
   ADGNET has an F1-score of 99.61\% and sensitivity is 99.69\%,
   outperforming two state-of-the-art models (ResNext WSL and SimCLR). The

Title = {{Discriminative and generative models for anatomical shape analysis on
   point clouds with deep neural networks}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{67}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{We introduce deep neural networks for the analysis of anatomical shapes
   that learn a low-dimensional shape representation from the given task,
   instead of relying on hand-engineered representations. Our framework is
   modular and consists of several computing blocks that perform
   fundamental shape processing tasks. The networks operate on unordered
   point clouds and provide invariance to similarity transformations,
   avoiding the need to identify point correspondences between shapes.
   Based on the framework, we assemble a discriminative model for disease
   classification and age regression, as well as a generative model for the
   accruate reconstruction of shapes.
   In particular, we propose a conditional generative model, where the
   condition vector provides a mechanism to control the generative process.
   For instance, it enables to assess shape variations specific to a
   particular diagnosis, when passing it as side information.
   Next to working on single shapes, we introduce an extension for the
   joint analysis of multiple anatomical structures, where the simultaneous
   modeling of multiple structures can lead to a more compact encoding and
   a better understanding of disorders.
   We demonstrate the advantages of our framework in comprehensive
   experiments on real and synthetic data. The key insights are that (i)
   learning a shape representation specific to the given task yields higher
   performance than alternative shape descriptors, (ii) multi-structure
   analysis is both more efficient and more accurate than single-structure
   analysis, and (iii) point clouds generated by our model capture
   morphological differences associated to Alzheimer's disease, to the
   point that they can be used to train a discriminative model for disease
   classification. Our framework naturally scales to the analysis of large
   datasets, giving it the potential to learn characteristic variations in
   large populations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Learning patterns of the ageing brain in MRI using deep convolutional

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2021}},
Volume = {{224}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Both normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases cause morphological
   changes to the brain. Age-related brain changes are subtle, nonlinear,
   and spatially and temporally heterogenous, both within a subject and
   across a population. Machine learning models are particularly suited to
   capture these patterns and can produce a model that is sensitive to
   changes of interest, despite the large variety in healthy brain
   appearance. In this paper, the power of convolutional neural networks
   (CNNs) and the rich UK Biobank dataset, the largest database currently
   available, are harnessed to address the problem of predicting brain age.
   We developed a 3D CNN architecture to predict chronological age, using a
   training dataset of 12,802 T1-weighted MRI images and a further 6,885
   images for testing. The proposed method shows competitive performance on
   age prediction, but, most importantly, the CNN prediction errors
   Delta(Brain Age) = Age(Predicated) - Age(True) correlated significantly
   with many clinical measurements from the UK Biobank in the female and
   male groups. In addition, having used images from only one imaging
   modality in this experiment, we examined the relationship between
   Delta(BrainAge) and the image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from all other
   imaging modalities in the UK Biobank, showing correlations consistent
   with known patterns of ageing. Furthermore, we show that the use of
   nonlinearly registered images to train CNNs can lead to the network
   being driven by artefacts of the registration process and missing subtle
   indicators of ageing, limiting the clinical relevance. Due to the
   longitudinal aspect of the UK Biobank study, in the future it will be
   possible to explore whether the Delta(BrainAge) from models such as this
   network were predictive of any health outcomes.}},

Abstract = {{A growing elderly population suffering from incurable, chronic
   conditions such as dementia present a continual strain on medical
   services due to mental impairment paired with high comorbidity resulting
   in increased hospitalization risk. The identification of at risk
   individuals allows for preventative measures to alleviate said strain.
   Electronic health records provide opportunity for big data analysis to
   address such applications. Such data however, provides a challenging
   problem space for traditional statistics and machine learning due to
   high dimensionality and sparse data elements. This article proposes a
   novel machine learning methodology: entropy regularization with ensemble
   deep neural networks (ECNN), which simultaneously provides high
   predictive performance of hospitalization of patients with dementia
   whilst enabling an interpretable heuristic analysis of the model
   architecture, able to identify individual features of importance within
   a large feature domain space. Experimental results on health records
   containing 54,647 features were able to identify 10 event indicators
   within a patient timeline: a collection of diagnostic events, medication
   prescriptions and procedural events, the highest ranked being essential
   hypertension. The resulting subset was still able to provide a highly
   competitive hospitalization prediction (Accuracy: 0.759) as compared to
   the full feature domain (Accuracy: 0.755) or traditional feature
   selection techniques (Accuracy: 0.737), a significant reduction in
   feature size. The discovery and heuristic evidence of correlation
   provide evidence for further clinical study of said medical events as
   potential novel indicators. There also remains great potential for
   adaption of ECNN within other medical big data domains as a data mining
   tool for novel risk factor identification.}},

Abstract = {{Neurological abnormalities identified via neuroimaging are common in

   spectrum imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic
   resonance diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance perfusion
   weighted imaging, magnetic resonance sensitive weighted imaging, and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed specific changes not

   an increased myoinositol/creatine ratio revealed via magnetic resonance
   imaging. Atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and posterior

   show small bleeds and abnormal iron metabolism. Task-related functional
   magnetic resonance imaging can display brain function activity through
   cerebral blood oxygenation. Resting functional magnetic resonance

Abstract = {{Background Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia,
   typically characterized by memory loss followed by progressive cognitive
   decline and functional impairment. Many clinical trials of potential
   therapies for AD have failed, and there is currently no approved
   disease-modifying treatment. Biomarkers for early detection and
   mechanistic understanding of disease course are critical for drug
   development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the focus of most
   biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based framework
   to identify informative features for AD classification using tau
   positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Results The 3D convolutional
   neural network (CNN)-based classification model of AD from cognitively
   normal (CN) yielded an average accuracy of 90.8\% based on five-fold
   cross-validation. The LRP model identified the brain regions in tau PET
   images that contributed most to the AD classification from CN. The top
   identified regions included the hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus,
   and fusiform. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) results were
   consistent with those from the voxel-wise analysis in SPM12, showing
   significant focal AD associated regional tau deposition in the bilateral
   temporal lobes including the entorhinal cortex. The AD probability
   scores calculated by the classifier were correlated with brain tau
   deposition in the medial temporal lobe in MCI participants (r = 0.43 for
   early MCI and r = 0.49 for late MCI). Conclusion A deep learning
   framework combining 3D CNN and LRP algorithms can be used with tau PET
   images to identify informative features for AD classification and may
   have application for early detection during prodromal stages of AD.}},

   study, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD
   classification algorithm using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans
   from AD patients and age/gender-matched cognitively normal controls from
   two populations that differ in ethnicity and education level. These
   populations come from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital
   (SNUBH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each
   population, we trained CNNs on five subsets using coronal slices of
   T1-weighted images that cover the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated the
   models on validation subsets from both the same population
   (within-dataset validation) and other population (between-dataset
   validation). Our models achieved average areas under the curves of
   0.91-0.94 for within-dataset validation and 0.88-0.89 for
   between-dataset validation. The mean processing time per person was
   23-24 s. The within-dataset and between-dataset performances were
   comparable between the ADNI-derived and SNUBH-derived models. These
   results demonstrate the generalizability of our models to different
   patients with different ethnicities and education levels, as well as
   their potential for deployment as fast and accurate diagnostic support
   tools for AD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The objective of this study was to describe clinical features,
   {[}F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET)
   metabolism and digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive
   aphasia (LPA) and pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease
   (DLBD) and compare to patients with LPA with other pathologies, as well
   as patients with classical features of probable dementia with Lewy
   bodies (pDLB).
   Methods This is a clinicopathologic case-control study of 45 patients,
   including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were
   diagnosed with LPA-DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared
   FDG-PET metabolism in LPA-DLBD to an independent group of patients with
   clinical pDLB and regional alpha-synuclein burden on digital pathology
   to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology
   and antemortem pDLB (DLB-DLBD).
   Results All patients with LPA-DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and
   neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA-DLBD,
   LPA-Alzheimer's disease (LPA-AD), and LPA-frontotemporal lobar
   degeneration (LPA-FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked
   genes were negative with the exception of APOE epsilon 4 allele present
   in 83\% of LPA-DLBD patients. Seventy-five percent of the patients with
   LPA-DLBD showed a parietal-dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; LPA-FTLD
   - temporal-dominant pattern, whereas LPA-AD showed heterogeneous
   patterns of hypometabolism. LPA-DLBD had more asymmetrical
   hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital
   lobe in the nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB.
   LPA-DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical
   Lewy body counts, and higher alpha-synuclein burden in the middle
   frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB-DLBD.
   Interpretation Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of
   LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype
   possibly due to alpha-synuclein-associated functional impairment of the
   dominant parietal lobe. ANN NEUROL 2020}},

   Blood Test Data for Health Examination}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{DEC 14}},
Abstract = {{Background: In order to develop a new screening test of cognitive
   impairment, we studied whether cognitive function can be estimated from
   basic blood test data by applying deep learning models. This model was
   constructed based on the effects of systemic metabolic disorders on
   cognitive function.
   Methods: We employed a deep neural network (DNN) to predict cognitive
   function based on subject's age and blood test items (23 items). We
   included 202 patients (73.48 +/- 13.1 years) with various systemic
   metabolic disorders for training of the DNN model, and the following
   groups for validation of the model: (1) Patient group, 65 patients (73.6
   +/- 11.0 years) who were hospitalized for rehabilitation after stroke;
   (2) Healthy group, 37 subjects (62.0 +/- 8.6 years); (3) Health
   examination group, 165 subjects (54.0 +/- 8.6 years) admitted for a
   health examination. The subjects underwent the Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE).
   Results: There were significant positive correlations between the
   predicted MMSE scores and ground truth scores in the Patient and Healthy
   groups (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences
   between the predicted MMSE scores and ground truth scores in the Patient
   group (p > 0.05); however, in the Healthy group, the predicted MMSE
   scores were slightly, but significantly, lower than the ground truth
   scores (p < 0.05). In the Health examination group, the DNN model
   classified 94 subjects as normal (MMSE = 27-30), 67 subjects as having
   mild cognitive impairment (24-26), and four subjects as having dementia
   (<= 23). In 37 subjects in the Health examination group, the predicted
   MMSE scores were slightly lower than the ground truth MMSE (p < 0.05).
   In contrast, in the subjects with neurological disorders, such as
   subarachnoid hemorrhage, the ground truth MMSE scores were lower than
   the predicted scores.
   Conclusions: The DNN model could predict cognitive function accurately.
   The predicted MMSE scores were significantly lower than the ground truth
   scores in the Healthy and Health examination groups, while there was no
   significant difference in the Patient group. We suggest that the
   difference between the predicted and ground truth MMSE scores was caused
   by changes in atherosclerosis with aging, and that applying the DNN
   model to younger subjects may predict future cognitive impairment after
   the onset of atherosclerosis.}},

   Software Development Using Deep Learning Technology}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{22}},
Number = {{12}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: High-resolution medical images that include facial regions
   can be used to recognize the subject's face when reconstructing
   3-dimensional (3D)-rendered images from 2-dimensional (2D) sequential
   images, which might constitute a risk of infringement of personal
   information when sharing data. According to the Health Insurance
   Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, full-face
   photographic images and any comparable image are direct identifiers and
   considered as protected health information. Moreover, the General Data
   Protection Regulation (GDPR) categorizes facial images as biometric data
   and stipulates that special restrictions should be placed on the
   processing of biometric data.
   Objective: This study aimed to develop software that can remove the
   header information from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine
   (DICOM) format files and facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) at the
   2D sliced-image level to anonymize personal information in medical
   images.
   Methods: A total of 240 cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images were used
   to train the deep learning model (144, 48, and 48 for the training,
   validation, and test sets, respectively, from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative {[}ADNI] database). To overcome the small sample
   size problem, we used a data augmentation technique to create 576 images
   per epoch. We used attention-gated U-net for the basic structure of our
   deep learning model. To validate the performance of the software, we
   adapted an external test set comprising 100 cranial MR images from the
   Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database.
   Results: The facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) were successfully
   detected and anonymized in both test sets (48 from ADNI and 100 from
   OASIS). Each result was manually validated in both the 2D image plane
   and the 3D-rendered images. Furthermore, the ADNI test set was verified
   using Microsoft Azure's face recognition artificial intelligence
   service. By adding a user interface, we developed and distributed (via
   GitHub) software named ``Deface program{''} for medical images as an
   open-source project.
   Conclusions: We developed deep learning-based software for the
   anonymization of MR images that distorts the eyes, nose, and ears to
   prevent facial identification of the subject in reconstructed 3D images.
   It could be used to share medical big data for secondary research while
   making both data providers and recipients compliant with the relevant
   privacy regulations.}},

Abstract = {{Patches from three orthogonal views of selected cerebral regions can be

   Three-view patches (TVPs) from these regions were fed to the CNN for

Abstract = {{Objective The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic
   accuracy of antemortem C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) versus
   autopsy diagnosis in a heterogenous sample of patients.
   Methods One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during
   life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually
   interpreted by 3 raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was
   rated as positive or negative for cortical retention, whereas FDG scans
   were read as showing an Alzheimer disease (AD) or non-AD pattern.
   Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria.
   Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate-high AD
   neuropathological change (ADNC).
   Results One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2
   years, 41 females, Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET-to-autopsy
   interval = 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56
   showed non-AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar
   degeneration {[}FTLD]), and 13 showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB
   showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate-high ADNC
   (96\%, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI] = 89-100\% vs 80\%, 95\% CI =
   68-92\%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86\%, 95\% CI = 76-95\%
   vs 84\%, 95\% CI = 74-93\%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB
   and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97\% (95\% CI =
   92-100\%) and specificity was 98\% (95\% CI = 93-100\%). Nine of 24
   patients with incongruent reads were found to have co-occurrence of AD
   and non-AD pathologies.
   Interpretation In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive
   impairment, PIB-PET had higher sensitivity than FDG-PET for
   intermediate-high ADNC, with similar specificity. When both modalities
   are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100\%, whereas mixed
   pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent. ANN

Title = {{A novel method for segmenting brain tumor using modified watershed
   algorithm in MRI image with FPGA}},
Journal = {{BIOSYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{198}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{The goal of the segmentation of brain images is to separate the images
   in different non-compatible homogenous areas reflecting the numerous
   anatomical structures. Brain segmentation by magnetic resonance has
   numerous implications for diagnosing brain disorganizations such as
   Alzheimer's, Parkinson-related syndrome among others. However, it is not
   an simple job to automatically segment the MR image. The main motive of
   this study is to provide a better segmentation approach for the segment
   of the ROI (Region Of Interest) region from the MRI image by solving the
   issues that currently exist in the literary works. MRI segmentation is
   not a trivial task, because acquired MR images are imperfect and are
   often corrupted by noise and other image artifacts. The variety in
   technologies for image processing has contributed to the creation in
   numerous image segmentation techniques. That is because there is no
   universal approach, nor are all methods necessarily appropriate for a
   specific form of picture suitable for all pictures. Other approaches
   still use the gray level histogram, for example, while others integrate
   detailed spatial picture details for bleeding conditions. Some methods
   use statistical techniques, but some do incorporate existing information
   to enhance segmentation efficiency. Some methods utilize probabilistic
   or fuzzy methods. Yet there are certain inconveniences of all the
   current processes. Therefore, we have intended to propose a new
   segmentation approach for the ROI region segmentation. The proposed work
   comprised of three phases namely preprocessing, edge detection and
   segmentation. At first, the MRI images are extracted from the database
   and that each of the input images is enhanced by applying a high pass
   filter. After completing the preprocessing method, the enhanced canny
   edge detection (ECED) approach is used to enhance the image. After that,
   the images are given to the modified watershed segmentation (MWS)
   algorithm which separates the ROI part from MRI Image. The testing
   consequences demonstrate that the proposed system accomplishes to give
   the good result related to the available strategies. Xilinx Virtex-5
   FPGA is used to implement in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by progressive loss of memory and general decline in
   cognitive functions. Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI
   provide useful information for the classification of patients on the
   basis of brain biomarkers. Recently, CNN methods have emerged as
   powerful tools to improve classification using images.
   New Method: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain
   scans focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal
   region. The network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon
   which models are built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis.
   We evaluated various types of transfer learning through the following
   mechanisms: (i) cross-modal (sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain
   transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a hybrid transfer learning of both
   types.
   Results: Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and
   with a limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases
   accuracy with more than 5 points for the most difficult classification
   tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and MCI/NC.
   Comparison with Existing Method(s): Our methodology provides good
   accuracy scores for classification over a shallow convolutional network.
   Besides, we focused only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal
   region, where few slices are selected to feed the network. Also, we used
   cross-modal transfer learning.
   Conclusions: Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow
   CNN network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to
   significant results even if the model is trained on small datasets,
   which is often the case in medical image analysis.}},

Abstract = {{As the number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, the
   effort needed to care for these patients increases as well. At the same
   time, advances in information and sensor technologies have reduced
   caring costs, providing a potential pathway for developing healthcare
   services for AD patients. For instance, if a virtual reality (VR) system
   can provide emotion-adaptive content, the time that AD patients spend
   interacting with VR content is expected to be extended, allowing
   caregivers to focus on other tasks. As the first step towards this goal,
   in this study, we develop a classification model that detects AD
   patients' emotions (e.g., happy, peaceful, or bored). We first collected
   electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 Korean female AD patients who
   watched emotion-evoking videos at a medical rehabilitation center. We
   applied conventional machine learning algorithms, such as a multilayer
   perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine, along with deep learning
   models of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures. The best
   performance was obtained from MLP, which achieved an average accuracy of

Title = {{Automated segmentation of the hypothalamus and associated subunits in
   brain MRI}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Despite the crucial role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of the
   human body, neuroimaging studies of this structure and its nuclei are
   scarce. Such scarcity partially stems from the lack of automated
   segmentation tools, since manual delineation suffers from scalability
   and reproducibility issues. Due to the small size of the hypothalamus
   and the lack of image contrast in its vicinity, automated segmentation
   is difficult and has been long neglected by widespread neuroimaging
   packages like FreeSurfer or FSL. Nonetheless, recent advances in deep
   machine learning are enabling us to tackle difficult segmentation
   problems with high accuracy. In this paper we present a fully automated
   tool based on a deep convolutional neural network, for the segmentation
   of the whole hypothalamus and its subregions from T1-weighted MRI scans.
   We use aggressive data augmentation in order to make the model robust to
   T1-weighted MR scans from a wide array of different sources, without any
   need for preprocessing. We rigorously assess the performance of the
   presented tool through extensive analyses, including: inter- and
   intra-rater variability experiments between human observers; comparison
   of our tool with manual segmentation; comparison with an automated
   method based on multi-atlas segmentation; assessment of robustness by
   quality control analysis of a larger, heterogeneous dataset (ADNI); and
   indirect evaluation with a volumetric study performed on ADNI. The
   presented model outperforms multi-atlas segmentation scores as well as
   inter-rater accuracy level, and approaches intra-rater precision. Our
   method does not require any preprocessing and runs in less than a second
   on a GPU, and approximately 10 seconds on a CPU. The source code as well
   as the trained model are publicly available at
   https://github.com/BBillot/hypothalamus\_seg, and will also be
   distributed with FreeSurfer.}},

Title = {{Disentangling time series between brain tissues improves fMRI data
   quality using a time-dependent deep neural network}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{223}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Functional MRI (fMRI) is a prominent imaging technique to probe brain
   function, however, a substantial proportion of noise from multiple
   sources influences the reliability and reproducibility of fMRI data
   analysis and limits its clinical applications. Extensive effort has been
   devoted to improving fMRI data quality, but in the last two decades,
   there is no consensus reached which technique is more effective. In this
   study, we developed a novel deep neural network for denoising fMRI data,
   named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural network is 1)
   applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model noise; 2)
   spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in
   different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output
   denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on
   each subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR)
   of fMRI data. When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression
   methods for denoising fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) database, only DeNN had connectivity for functionally
   uncorrelated regions close to zero and successfully identified unbiased
   correlations between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and multiple
   brain regions within the default mode network or task positive network.
   The whole brain functional connectivity maps computed with DeNN-denoised
   data are approximately three times as homogeneous as the functional
   connectivity maps computed with raw data. Furthermore, the improved
   homogeneity strengthens rather than weakens the statistical power of
   fMRI in detecting intrinsic functional differences between cognitively
   normal subjects and subjects with Alzheimer's disease.}},

Title = {{The reliability of a deep learning model in clinical out-of-distribution
   MRI data: A multicohort study}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{66}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Deep learning (DL) methods have in recent years yielded impressive
   results in medical imaging, with the potential to function as clinical
   aid to radiologists. However, DL models in medical imaging are often
   trained on public research cohorts with images acquired with a single
   scanner or with strict protocol harmonization, which is not
   representative of a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to
   investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen clinical
   datasets-collected with different scanners, protocols and disease
   populations-and whether more heterogeneous training data improves
   generalization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple
   dementia research cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually
   rated by a neuroradiologist according to Scheltens' scale of medial
   temporal atrophy (MTA), were included in this study. By training
   multiple versions of a convolutional neural network on different subsets
   of this data to predict MTA ratings, we assessed the impact of including
   images from a wider distribution during training had on performance in
   external memory clinic data. Our results showed that our model
   generalized well to datasets acquired with similar protocols as the
   training data, but substantially worse in clinical cohorts with visibly
   different tissue contrasts in the images. This implies that future DL
   studies investigating performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) MRI data
   need to assess multiple external cohorts for reliable results. Further,
   by including data from a wider range of scanners and protocols the
   performance improved in OOD data, which suggests that more heterogeneous
   training data makes the model generalize better. To conclude, this is
   the most comprehensive study to date investigating the domain shift in
   deep learning on MRI data, and we advocate rigorous evaluation of DL
   models on clinical data prior to being certified for deployment. (C)

Abstract = {{BackgroundThe identification of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI),
   which is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated
   with brain structural and functional changes, is still a challenging
   task. Recent studies show great promises for improving the performance
   of EMCI identification by combining multiple structural and functional
   features, such as grey matter volume and shortest path length. However,
   extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to
   improve the performance of EMCI identification have always been a
   challenging problem. To address this problem, in this study we propose a
   new EMCI identification framework using multi-modal data and graph
   convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly, we extract grey matter volume
   and shortest path length of each brain region based on automated
   anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas as feature representation from T1w MRI
   and rs-fMRI data of each subject, respectively. Then, in order to obtain
   features that are more helpful in identifying EMCI, a common multi-task
   feature selection method is applied. Afterwards, we construct a
   non-fully labelled subject graph using imaging and non-imaging
   phenotypic measures of each subject. Finally, a GCN model is adopted to
   perform the EMCI identification task.ResultsOur proposed EMCI
   identification method is evaluated on 210 subjects, including 105
   subjects with EMCI and 105 normal controls (NCs), with both T1w MRI and
   rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves
   an accuracy of 84.1\% and an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.856 for EMCI/NC classification. In
   addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed
   framework are better than those of some existing methods in EMCI
   identification.ConclusionOur proposed EMCI identification framework is
   effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of EMCI in clinical
   practice.}},

Title = {{AI-driven attenuation correction for brain PET/MRI: Clinical evaluation
   of a dementia cohort and importance of the training group size}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{222}},
Month = {{NOV 15}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Robust and reliable attenuation correction (AC) is a
   prerequisite for accurate quantification of activity concentration. In
   combined PET/MRI, AC is challenged by the lack of bone signal in the MRI
   from which the AC maps has to be derived. Deep learning-based
   image-to-image translation networks present itself as an optimal
   solution for MRI-derived AC (MR-AC). High robustness and
   generalizability of these networks are expected to be achieved through
   large training cohorts. In this study, we implemented an MR-AC method
   based on deep learning, and investigated how training cohort size,
   transfer learning, and MR input affected robustness, and subsequently
   evaluated the method in a clinical setup, with the overall aim to
   explore if this method could be implemented in clinical routine for
   PET/MRI examinations.
   Methods: A total cohort of 1037 adult subjects from the Siemens Biograph
   mMR with two different software versions (VB20P and VE11P) was used. The
   software upgrade included updates to all MRI sequences. The impact of
   training group size was investigated by training a convolutional neural
   network (CNN) on an increasing training group size from 10 to 403. The
   ability to adapt to changes in the input images between software
   versions were evaluated using transfer learning from a large cohort to a
   smaller cohort, by varying training group size from 5 to 91 subjects.
   The impact of MRI sequence was evaluated by training three networks
   based on the Dixon VIBE sequence (DeepDixon), T1-weighted MPRAGE
   (DeepT1), and ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence (DeepUTE). Blinded
   clinical evaluation relative to the reference low-dose CT (CT-AC) was
   performed for DeepDixon in 104 independent
   2-{[}F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ({[}F-18]FDG) PET patient studies
   performed for suspected neurodegenerative disorder using statistical
   surface projections.
   Results: Robustness increased with group size in the training data set:
   100 subjects were required to reduce the number of outliers compared to
   a state-of-the-art segmentation-based method, and a cohort >400 subjects
   further increased robustness in terms of reduced variation and number of
   outliers. When using transfer learning to adapt to changes in the MRI
   input, as few as five subjects were sufficient to minimize outliers.
   Full robustness was achieved at 20 subjects. Comparable robust and
   accurate results were obtained using all three types of MRI input with a
   bias below 1\% relative to CT-AC in any brain region. The clinical PET
   evaluation using DeepDixon showed no clinically relevant differences
   compared to CT-AC.
   Conclusion: Deep learning based AC requires a large training cohort to
   achieve accurate and robust performance. Using transfer learning, only
   five subjects were needed to fine-tune the method to large changes to
   the input images. No clinically relevant differences were found compared
   to CT-AC, indicating that clinical implementation of our deep
   learning-based MR-AC method will be feasible across MRI system types
   using transfer learning and a limited number of subjects.}},

Abstract = {{Early identification of individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) dementia is important for developing disease-modifying
   therapies. In this study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical
   diagnosis of an individual from one or more timepoints, we seek to
   predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume of the
   individual for every month (indefinitely) into the future. We proposed
   and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) model to
   data from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution
   (TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants
   (Marinescu et al., 2018) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model
   and four baseline algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most
   previous work on predicting AD progression ignore the issue of missing
   data, which is a prevalent issue in longitudinal data. Here, we explored
   three different strategies to handle missing data. Two of the strategies
   treated the missing data as a ``preprocessing{''} issue, by imputing the
   missing data using the previous timepoint ({''}forward filling{''}) or
   linear interpolation ({''}linear filling). The third strategy utilized
   the minimalRNN model itself to fill in the missing data both during
   training and testing ({''}model filling{''}). Our analyses suggest that
   the minimalRNN with ``model filling{''} compared favorably with baseline
   algorithms, including support vector machine/regression, linear state
   space (LSS) model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly,
   although the training procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found
   that the trained minimalRNN model exhibited similar performance, when
   using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input timepoints, suggesting that our
   approach might work well with just cross-sectional data. An earlier
   version of our approach was ranked 5th (out of 53 entries) in the
   TADPOLE challenge in 2019. The current approach is ranked 2nd out of 63
   entries as of June 3rd, 2020.}},

Title = {{Intelligent multimodal medical image fusion with deep guided filtering}},
Journal = {{MULTIMEDIA SYSTEMS}},
Abstract = {{Medical image fusion is a synthesis of visual information present in any
   number of medical imaging inputs into a single fused image without any
   distortion or loss of detail. It enhances image quality by retaining
   specific features to improve the clinical applicability of medical
   imaging for treatment and evaluation of medical conditions. A big
   challenge in the processing of medical images is to incorporate the
   pathological features of the complement into one image. The fused image
   presents various challenges, such as existence of fusion artifacts,
   hardness of the base, comparison of medical image input, and
   computational cost. The techniques of hybrid multimodal medical image
   fusion (HMMIF) have been designed for pathologic studies, such as
   neurocysticercosis, degenerative and neoplastic diseases. Two domain
   algorithms based on HMMIF techniques have been developed in this
   research for various medical image fusion applications for MRI-SPECT,
   MRI-PET, and MRI-CT. NSCT is initially used in the proposed method to
   decompose the input images which give components of low and high
   frequency. The average fusion rule applies to NSCT components with low
   frequency. The NSCT high frequency components are fused by the law of
   full fusion. NSCTs high frequency is handled with directed image
   filtration scheme. The fused picture is obtained by taking inverse
   transformations from all frequency bands with the coefficients obtained
   from them. The methods suggested are contrasted with traditional
   approaches in the state of the art. Experimentation proves that the
   methods suggested are superior in terms of both qualitative and
   quantitative assessment. The fused images using proposed algorithms
   provide information useful for visualizing and understanding the
   diseases to the best of both sources' modality.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives African Americans are at greater risk for developing
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia than non-Hispanic whites. In addition
   to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid
   disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD
   dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid
   (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences
   and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and
   measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race
   differences.
   Methods Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission
   tomography {[}PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and
   resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) were collected from
   African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal
   participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and
   cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities {[}WMHs] on MRI,
   blood pressure, and body mass index {[}BMI]) and area-based SES were
   included in mediation analyses.
   Results Compared to white participants, African American participants
   had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes
   (Cohen's f(2) = 0.05, p < 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between
   race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for
   amyloid, tau, or rs-fc signature.
   Interpretation Modifiable factors, such as differences in social
   contexts and resources, particularly area-level SES, may contribute to
   observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize
   collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the
   development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve
   the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease,

   Neutral Network (CNN) trained from scratch on MRI volumes; and (3) a
   fusion of two conventional-ML classifiers derived from different feature
   extraction/selection techniques coupled to SVM. The AD-vs-CN,
   MCIc-vs-CN, MCIc-vs-MCInc comparisons were investigated. The ensemble
   transfer-learning approach was able to effectively discriminate AD from
   CN with 90.2\% AUC, MCIc from CN with 83.2\% AUC, and MCIc from MCInc
   with 70.6\% AUC, showing comparable or slightly lower results with the
   fusion of conventional-ML systems (AD from CN with 93.1\% AUC, MCIc from
   CN with 89.6\% AUC, and MCIc from MCInc with AUC in the range of
   69.1-73.3\%). The deep-learning network trained from scratch obtained
   lower performance than either the fusion of conventional-ML systems and
   the ensemble transfer-learning, due to the limited sample of images used
   for training. These results open new prospective on the use of transfer
   learning combined with neuroimages for the automatic early diagnosis and
   prognosis of AD, even if pretrained on generic images.}},

Title = {{Alzheimer's Disease Classification With a Cascade Neural Network}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH}},

Abstract = {{Classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been becoming a hot issue
   along with the rapidly increasing number of patients. This task remains
   tremendously challenging due to the limited data and the difficulties in
   detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing methods use gait
   {[}or EEG (electroencephalogram)] data only to tackle this task.
   Although the gait data acquisition procedure is cheap and simple, the
   methods relying on gait data often fail to detect the slight difference
   between MCI and AD. The methods that use EEG data can detect the
   difference more precisely, but collecting EEG data from both HC (health
   controls) and patients is very time-consuming. More critically, these
   methods often convert EEG records into the frequency domain and thus
   inevitably lose the spatial and temporal information, which is essential
   to capture the connectivity and synchronization among different brain
   regions. This paper proposes a cascade neural network with two steps to
   achieve a faster and more accurate AD classification by exploiting gait
   and EEG data simultaneously. In the first step, we propose
   attention-based spatial temporal graph convolutional networks to extract
   the features from the skeleton sequences (i.e., gait) captured by Kinect
   (a commonly used sensor) to distinguish between HC and patients. In the
   second step, we propose spatial temporal convolutional networks to fully
   exploit the spatial and temporal information of EEG data and classify
   the patients into MCI or AD eventually. We collect gait and EEG data
   from 35 cognitively health controls, 35 MCI, and 17 AD patients to
   evaluate our proposed method. Experimental results show that our method
   significantly outperforms other AD diagnosis methods (91.07 vs. 68.18\%)
   in the three-way AD classification task (HC, MCI, and AD). Moreover, we
   empirically found that the lower body and right upper limb are more
   important for the early diagnosis of AD than other body parts. We
   believe this interesting finding can be helpful for clinical researches.}},

Title = {{Alzheimer's diagnosis using deep learning in segmenting and classifying
   3D brain MR images}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE}},
Abstract = {{Background and objectives
   Dementia is one of the brain diseases with serious symptoms such as
   memory loss, and thinking problems. According to the World Alzheimer
   Report 2016, in the world, there are 47 million people having dementia
   and it can be 131 million by 2050. There is no standard method to
   diagnose dementia, and consequently unable to access the treatment
   effectively. Hence, the computational diagnosis of the disease from
   brain Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) scans plays an important role in
   supporting the early diagnosis. Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a common type
   of Dementia, includes problems related to disorientation, mood swings,
   not managing self-care, and behavioral issues. In this article, we
   present a new computational method to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease from
   3D brain MR images.
   Methods
   An efficient approach to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI
   scans is proposed comprising two phases: I) segmentation and II)
   classification, both based on deep learning. After the brain tissues are
   segmented by a model that combines Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a new model combining Extreme
   Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to
   classify Alzheimer's disease based on the segmented tissues.
   Results
   We present two evaluations for segmentation and classification. For
   comparison, the new method was evaluated using the AD-86 and AD-126
   datasets leading to Dice 0.96 for segmentation in both datasets and
   accuracies 0.88, and 0.80 for classification, respectively.
   Conclusion
   Deep learning gives prominent results for segmentation and feature
   extraction in medical image processing. The combination of XGboost and
   SVM improves the results obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Currently, it is still a great challenge in clinical practice to
   accurately detect the early state of Alzheimer's disease (AD), i.e.,
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI) including early MCI (EMCI) and late MCI
   (LMCI). To address this challenge, we propose a new MCI detection
   framework based on multi-atlas multi-view hybrid graph convolutional
   networks and ensemble learning. We first construct nine different graphs
   based on three brain atlases and three morphological measurements using
   both imaging and non-imaging data of each subject. Then, in order to
   integrate the information of different graphs and obtain more
   discriminative feature representations for detecting MCI, we propose a
   hybrid graph convolutional network method. Finally, a new ensemble
   learning method is proposed to perform MCI detection tasks. An
   evaluation of our proposed framework has been conducted with 369
   subjects with cognitively normal (CN), 779 subjects with MCI including
   310 subjects with EMCI and 469 subjects with LMCI, and 301 subjects with
   AD on three classification tasks. Experimental results show that our
   proposed framework can get an accuracy of 90.8\% and an AUC of 0.932 for
   MCI/CN classification, an accuracy of 88.6\% and an AUC of 0.908 for
   MCI/AD classification, and an accuracy of 83.5\% and an AUC of 0.851 for

   state-of-the-art methods about MCI detection, our proposed framework can
   get better performance. Overall, our proposed framework is effective and

   transfer learning}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{7}},
Number = {{6}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Generalizability is an important problem in deep neural
   networks, especially with variability of data acquisition in clinical
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recently, the spatially localized
   atlas network tiles (SLANT) can effectively segment whole brain,
   non-contrast T1w MRI with 132 volumetric labels. Transfer learning (TL)
   is a commonly used domain adaptation tool to update the neural network
   weights for local factors, yet risks degradation of performance on the
   original validation/test cohorts.
   Approach: We explore TL using unlabeled clinical data to address these
   concerns in the context of adapting SLANT to scanning protocol
   variations. We optimize whole-brain segmentation on heterogeneous
   clinical data by leveraging 480 unlabeled pairs of clinically acquired
   T1w MRI with and without intravenous contrast. We use labels generated
   on the pre-contrast image to train on the post-contrast image in a
   five-fold cross-validation framework. We further validated on a withheld
   test set of 29 paired scans over a different acquisition domain.
   Results: Using TL, we improve reproducibility across imaging pairs
   measured by the reproducibility Dice coefficient (rDSC) between the pre-
   and post-contrast image. We showed an increase over the original SLANT
   algorithm (rDSC 0.82 versus 0.72) and the FreeSurfer v6.0.1 segmentation
   pipeline (rDSC = 0.53). We demonstrate the impact of this work
   decreasing the root-mean-squared error of volumetric estimates of the
   hippocampus between paired images of the same subject by 67\%.
   Conclusion: This work demonstrates a pipeline for unlabeled clinical
   data to translate algorithms optimized for research data to generalize
   toward heterogeneous clinical acquisitions. (C) 2020 Society of

   network alterations}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{221}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to changes in fMRI task activations
   and fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC), which can
   emerge early in the illness timecourse. These fMRI correlates of
   unhealthy aging have been studied in largely separate subfields. Taking
   inspiration from neural network simulations, we propose a unifying
   mechanism wherein restFC alterations associated with AD disrupt the flow
   of activations between brain regions, leading to aberrant task
   activations. We apply this activity flow model in a large sample of
   clinically normal older adults, which was segregated into healthy
   (low-risk) and at-risk subgroups based on established imaging (positron
   emission tomography amyloid) and genetic (apolipoprotein) AD risk
   factors. Modeling the flow of healthy activations over at-risk AD
   connectivity effectively transformed the healthy aged activations into
   unhealthy (at-risk) aged activations. This enabled reliable prediction
   of at-risk AD task activations, and these predicted activations were
   related to individual differences in task behavior. These results
   support activity flow over altered intrinsic functional connections as a
   mechanism underlying Alzheimer's-related dysfunction, even in very early
   stages of the illness. Beyond these mechanistic insights, this approach
   raises clinical potential by enabling prediction of task activations and
   associated cognitive dysfunction in individuals without requiring them
   to perform in-scanner cognitive tasks.}},

   (PCCE). We investigated Functional Connectivity (FC) of ASD and TD brain
   from 238 functionally defined regions of interest. Furthermore, we
   constructed a series of feature sets by applying conditional random
   forests and conditional permutation importance. We built classifier
   models by Random Forest (RF), Oblique RF (ORF), Support Vector Machine

   features are ranked based on p-value and we analyzed the top 20 FC
   features.
   Results: We achieved a single-trial test accuracy of 72.5 \%, though

   average test accuracy (70.31 \%) and area under the curve (0.73)

   are from networks such as Dorsal Attention (DA), Cingulo-Opercular Task
   Control (COTC), somatosensory motor hand and subcortical. In addition,
   among top 20 PCCE features, many FC links are found between COTC and DA

   During Landmark-Based Navigation in Young and Healthy Older Adults}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{OCT 29}},
Abstract = {{Older adults have difficulties in navigating unfamiliar environments and
   updating their wayfinding behavior when faced with blocked routes. This
   decline in navigational capabilities has traditionally been ascribed to
   memory impairments and dysexecutive function, whereas the impact of
   visual aging has often been overlooked. The ability to perceive
   visuospatial information such as salient landmarks is essential to
   navigating efficiently. To date, the functional and neurobiological
   factors underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently
   characterized. To address this issue, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the brain activity associated
   with landmark-based navigation in young and healthy older participants.
   The performances of 25 young adults (mu = 25.4 years, sigma = 2.7; seven
   females) and 17 older adults (mu = 73.0 years, sigma = 3.9; 10 females)
   were assessed in a virtual-navigation task in which they had to orient
   using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of activity
   as well as the functional roles of specific cerebral regions involved in
   landmark processing, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the
   occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), were
   analyzed. Older adults' navigational abilities were overall diminished
   compared to young adults. Also, the two age groups relied on distinct
   navigational strategies to solve the task. Better performances during
   landmark-based navigation were associated with increased neural activity
   in an extended neural network comprising several cortical and cerebellar
   regions. Direct comparisons between age groups revealed that young
   participants had greater anterior temporal activity. Also, only young
   adults showed significant activity in occipital areas corresponding to
   the cortical projection of the central visual field during
   landmark-based navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed an
   increased OPA activation in older adult participants during the landmark
   condition. There were no significant between-group differences in PPA
   and RSC activations. These preliminary results hint at the possibility
   that aging diminishes fine-grained information processing in occipital
   and temporal regions, thus hindering the capacity to use landmarks
   adequately for navigation. Keeping sight of its exploratory nature, this
   work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics
   subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the
   impact of age-related visuospatial processing differences on navigation
   capabilities.}},

   Because cortical regions are close to bone, quantitation accuracy of
   amyloid and tau PET imaging can be significantly influenced by errors of
   attenuation correction (AC). This work presents an MR-based AC method
   that combines deep learning with a novel ultrashort time-to-echo
   (UTE)/multi-echo Dixon (mUTE) sequence for amyloid and tau imaging.
   Methods Thirty-five subjects that underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-MK6240
   scans were included in this study. The proposed method was compared with
   Dixon-based atlas method as well as magnetization-prepared rapid
   acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)- or Dixon-based deep learning
   methods. The Dice coefficient and validation loss of the generated
   pseudo-CT images were used for comparison. PET error images regarding
   standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were quantified through regional
   and surface analysis to evaluate the final AC accuracy. Results The Dice
   coefficients of the deep learning methods based on MPRAGE, Dixon, and
   mUTE images were 0.84 (0.91), 0.84 (0.92), and 0.87 (0.94) for the
   whole-brain (above-eye) bone regions, respectively, higher than the
   atlas method of 0.52 (0.64). The regional SUVR error for the atlas
   method was around 6\%, higher than the regional SUV error. The regional
   SUV and SUVR errors for all deep learning methods were below 2\%, with
   mUTE-based deep learning method performing the best. As for the surface
   analysis, the atlas method showed the largest error (> 10\%) near
   vertices inside superior frontal, lateral occipital, superior parietal,
   and inferior temporal cortices. The mUTE-based deep learning method
   resulted in the least number of regions with error higher than 1\%, with
   the largest error (> 5\%) showing up near the inferior temporal and
   medial orbitofrontal cortices. Conclusion Deep learning with mUTE can
   generate accurate AC for amyloid and tau imaging in PET/MR.}},

   Adversarial Deep Neural Network on Structural Magnetic Resonance Images}},

Abstract = {{Methods: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are the first
   and third most common forms of dementia. Due to their similar clinical
   symptoms, they are easily misdiagnosed as each other even with
   sophisticated clinical guidelines. For disease-specific intervention and
   treatment, it is essential to develop a computer-aided system to improve
   the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. Recent advances in deep
   learning have delivered some of the best performance for medical image
   recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential
   diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored.
   Approach: In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning based
   framework to distinguish between brain images of normal aging
   individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. Specifically, we combined the
   multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features with Generative
   Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the
   differential diagnosis accuracy.
   Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, and data augmentation
   methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis for both AD and
   FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large sample
   of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall
   accuracy of 88.28\%.
   Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are three-fold: (1)
   our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple structural
   features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural
   network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we
   show that the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data
   augmentation could further improve the discriminant ability of the
   network regarding challenging tasks such as differentiating dementia
   sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble classifier strategy
   could make the network more robust and stable.}},

Abstract = {{Background. As a chronic progressive disease, diabetes mellitus (DM) has
   a high incidence worldwide, and it impacts on cognitive and learning
   abilities in the lifetime even in the early stage, may degenerate memory
   in middle age, and perhaps increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease.
   Method. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN)
   based classification method to help classify diabetes by distinguishing
   the brains with abnormal functions from the normal ones on resting-state
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The proposed
   classification model is based on the Inception-v4-Residual convolutional
   neural network architecture. In our workflow, the original rs-fMRI data
   are first mapped to generate amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
   (ALFF) images and then fed into the CNN model to get the classification
   result to indicate the potential existence of DM. Result. We validate
   our method on a realistic clinical rs-fMRI dataset, and the achieved
   average accuracy is 89.95\% in fivefold cross-validation. Our model
   achieves a 0.8690 AUC with 77.50\% and 77.51\% sensitivity and
   specificity using our local dataset, respectively. Conclusion. It has
   the potential to become a novel clinical preliminary screening tool that
   provides help for the classification of different categories based on
   functional brain alteration caused by diabetes, benefiting from its
   accuracy and robustness, as well as efficiency and patient friendliness.}},

   METHODS: Participants were middle school students consisting of 10 and 8

   RESULTS: Coherence in low-fit e4+ was lower than in high-fit e4+, while
   coherence in low-fit e4- was similar to or higher than in high-fit e4-.
   CONCLUSION: The presence of the e4 allele can decrease neural networking

   Alzheimer's Disease}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{OCT 16}},
Abstract = {{Background: The degenerative pattern of white matter (WM)
   microstructures during Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its relationship
   with cognitive function have not yet been clarified. The present
   research aimed to explore the alterations of the WM microstructure and
   its impact on amnestic mild cognitive (aMCI) and AD patients. Mechanical
   learning methods were used to explore the validity of WM microstructure
   lesions on the classification in AD spectrum disease.
   Methods: Neuropsychological data and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)
   images were collected from 28 AD subjects, 31 aMCI subjects, and 27
   normal controls (NC). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to
   extract diffusion parameters in WM tracts. We performed ANOVA analysis
   to compare diffusion parameters and clinical features among the three
   groups. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the
   relationship between diffusion metrics and cognitive functions
   controlling for age, gender, and years of education. Additionally, we
   performed the support vector machine (SVM) classification to determine
   the discriminative ability of DTI metrics in the differentiation of aMCI
   and AD patients from controls.
   Results: As compared to controls or aMCI patients, AD patients displayed
   widespread WM lesions, including in the inferior longitudinal
   fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and superior
   longitudinal fasciculus. Significant correlations between fractional
   anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusion (RD) of the
   long longitudinal tract and memory deficits were found in aMCI and AD
   groups, respectively. Furthermore, through SVM classification, we found
   DTI indicators generated by FA and MD parameters can effectively
   distinguish AD patients from the control group with accuracy rates of up
   to 89 and 85\%, respectively.
   Conclusion: The WM microstructure is extensively disrupted in AD
   patients, and the WM integrity of the long longitudinal tract is closely
   related to memory, which would hold potential value for monitoring the
   progression of AD. The method of classification based on SVM and WM
   damage features may be objectively helpful to the classification of AD
   diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is presently one of the
   most popular techniques for analysing the dynamic states in brain images
   using various kinds of algorithms. From the last decade, there is an
   exponential rise in the use of the machine and deep learning algorithms
   of artificial intelligence for analysing fMRI data. However, it is a big
   challenge for every researcher to choose a suitable machine or deep
   learning algorithm for analysing fMRI data due to the availability of a
   large number of algorithms in the literature. It takes much time for
   each researcher to know about the various approaches and algorithms
   which are in use for fMRI data. This paper provides a review in a
   systematic manner for the present literature of fMRI data that makes use
   of the machine and deep learning algorithms. The major goals of this
   review paper are to (a) identify machine learning and deep learning
   research trends for the implementation of fMRI; (b) identify usage of
   Machine Learning Algorithms and deep learning in fMRI, and (c) help new
   researchers based on fMRI to put their new findings appropriately in
   existing domain of fMRI research. The results of this systematic review
   identified various fMRI studies and classified them based on fMRI types,
   mental diseases, use of machine learning and deep learning algorithms.
   The authors have provided the studies with the best performance of
   machine learning and deep learning algorithms used in fMRI. The authors

   patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) Richardson's
   syndrome. We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau
   protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with
   clinical severity. Methods Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) for
   each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The
   {[}C-11]PK11195 and {[}F-18]AV-1451 BP(ND)values were correlated across
   all regions. The spatial distributions of {[}C-11]PK11195 and
   {[}F-18]AV-1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses
   (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the
   patients' clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale). Results
   Regional {[}C-11]PK11195 and {[}F-18]AV-1451 binding were positively
   correlated (R = 0.577,p< 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for
   each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or
   neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive
   associations between {[}C-11]PK11195 and {[}F-18]AV-1451 components'
   loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769,p< 0.0001) and

   between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R =
   0.667,p= 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788,p< 0.001).
   Interpretation We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation
   colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau
   pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity.
   Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal
   associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the
   combination of tau- and immune-oriented strategies may be useful for
   effective disease-modifying treatments in PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020}},

Abstract = {{Objective Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD)
   pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population,
   traditional vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing
   examination of cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight
   into its role in AD without the confound of vascular risk factors. We
   examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers of
   cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their
   cross-sectional relationship with age, beta-amyloid pathology, and mild
   cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status. Methods
   Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome
   study (n = 138, 50 +/- 7 years, 39\% women) with MRI data and a subset
   (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included.
   We derived MRI-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including
   white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and
   enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET-based biomarkers of
   amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable

   mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach
   provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under
   1 min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 h

   the first reading session. After more than 2-week interval, the readers
   additionally interpreted images with the quantification results provided
   by the deep learning system. The qualitative assessment was based on a
   3-point BAPL score (1: no amyloid load, 2: minor amyloid load, and 3:
   significant amyloid load). The confidence score for each session was
   evaluated by a 3-point score (0: ambiguous, 1: probably, and 2: definite
   to decide). Results Inter-reader agreements for the visual reading based
   on a 3-point scale (BAPL score) calculated by Fleiss kappa coefficients
   were 0.46 and 0.76 for the visual reading without and with the deep
   learning system, respectively. For the two reading sessions, the
   confidence score of visual reading was improved at the visual reading
   session with the output (1.27 +/- 0.078 for visual reading-only session
   vs. 1.66 +/- 0.63 for a visual reading session with the deep learning
   system). Conclusion Our results highlight the impact of deep
   learning-based one-step amyloid burden estimation system on inter-reader
   agreement and confidence of reading when applied to clinical routine
   amyloid PET reading.}},

   serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD;
   especially, the time-specific associations were notable: t-tau 8 to 16
   years, and Nf-L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum
   biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years;
   baseline t-tau > 0.40pg/ml had 30\% faster decline, Nf-L > 25.5pg/ml had
   110\% faster decline, and GFAP > 232pg/ml had 130\% faster decline

Abstract = {{Detection and diagnosis of early and subclinical stages of Alzheimer's
   Disease (AD) play an essential role in the implementation of
   intervention and prevention strategies. Neuroimaging techniques
   predominantly provide insight into anatomic structure changes associated
   with AD. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied towards
   creating and evaluating models capable of differentiating between
   cognitively unimpaired, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
   and AD dementia. Several published approaches apply information fusion
   techniques, providing ways of combining several input sources in the
   medical domain, which contributes to knowledge of broader and enriched
   quality. The aim of this paper is to fuse sociodemographic data such as
   age, marital status, education and gender, and genetic data (presence of
   an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon 4 allele) with Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (MRI) scans. This enables enriched multi-modal features, that
   adequately represent the MRI scan visually and is adopted for creating
   and modeling classification systems capable of detecting amnestic MCI
   (aMCI). To fully utilize the potential of deep convolutional neural
   networks, two extra color layers denoting contrast intensified and
   blurred image adaptations are virtually augmented to each MRI scan,
   completing the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color channels. Deep convolutional
   activation features (DeCAF) are extracted from the average pooling layer
   of the deep learning system Inception\_v3. These features from the fused
   MRI scans are used as visual representation for the Long Short-Term
   Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification model.
   The proposed approach is evaluated on a sub-study containing 120
   participants (aMCI = 61 and cognitively unimpaired = 59) of the Heinz
   Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study with a baseline model accuracy of 76\%.
   Further evaluation was conducted on the ADNI Phase 1 dataset with 624
   participants (aMCI = 397 and cognitively unimpaired = 227) with a
   baseline model accuracy of 66.27\%. Experimental results show that the
   proposed approach achieves 90\% accuracy and 0.90F(1)-Score at
   classification of aMCI vs. cognitively unimpaired participants on the
   HNR Study dataset, and 77\% accuracy and 0.83F(1)-Score on the ADNI
   dataset.}},

Abstract = {{Detection and classification methods have a vital and important role in

Journal = {{PATTERN ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS}},
Abstract = {{Diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI),
   and healthy subjects (Healthy) is currently lacking an automated tool.
   It requires experience of neuropsychologists and has sensibilities of
   80\% when separating between Healthy and MCI. The aim of this work is to
   evaluate the performance of a method for classification among the three
   groups using a database of 17 Healthy, 9 MCI and 15 AD. The method uses
   wavelet decomposition of the EEG signal (Haar mother wavelet and 5
   decomposition levels) to calculate the wavelet entropy and theta and
   beta relative power of the EEG signal. These features are used as inputs
   to a three-way classifier consisting in a support vector machine with
   polynomial kernel and a two-layer neural network. The last implements a
   vote procedure. Wavelet entropy was evaluated together with the sample
   entropy and approximated entropy to choose the one that best detected
   changes in the complexity of the EEG signal. The results show that it is
   possible to automatically classify a subject of a particular group with
   an overall accuracy of 92.6\%, close to the best result found in the
   literature that is 97.9\%. The method could be the basis for the
   implementation of a diagnosis-support quantitative tool oriented to aid

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{14}},
Month = {{SEP 16}},
Abstract = {{Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool in the
   diagnosis of brain diseases due to painlessness and safety.
   Nevertheless, Rician noise is inevitably injected during the image
   acquisition process, which leads to poor observation and interferes with
   the treatment. Owing to the complexity of Rician noise, using the
   elimination method of Gaussian to remove it does not perform well.
   Therefore, the feature fusion and attention network (FFA-DMRI) is
   proposed to separate noise from observed MRI. Inspired by the
   attention-guided CNN network (ADNet) and Convolutional block attention
   module (CBAM), a spatial attention mechanism has been specially designed
   to obtain the area of interest in MRI. Furthermore, the feature fusion
   block concatenates local with global information, which makes full use
   of the multilevel structure and boosts the expressive ability of
   network. The comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's disease
   neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI) have demonstrated high
   effectiveness of FFA-DMRI with maintaining the crucial brain details.
   Moreover, in terms of visual inspections, the denoising results are also
   consistent with human perception.}},

   application of dataset-specific cutoffs to global standard uptake value
   ratio (SUVr) values from 27 regions, single-tracer and pooled
   multitracer regional rankings were constructed from the frequency of
   abnormality across 400 CU individuals (100 per tracer). The pooled

Abstract = {{Dementia is a social problem in the aging society of advanced countries.
   Presently, 46.8 million people affected with dementia worldwide, and it
   may increase to 130 million by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the
   most common form of dementia. The cost of care for AD patients in 2015
   was 818 billion US dollars and is expected to increase intensely due to
   the increasing number of patients due to the aging society. It isn't
   easy to cure AD, but early detection is crucial. This paper proposes a
   multi-class classification of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and
   normal control (NC) subjects using three dimensional-convolutional
   neural network with Support Vector Machine classifier. A cross-sectional
   study on structural MRI data of 465 subjects, including 132 AD patients,
   181 MCI, and 152 NC, is performed in this paper. The highly complex and
   spatial atrophy patterns of the brain related to Alzheimer's Disease and
   MCI are extracted from structural MRI images using cascaded layers of
   the three dimensional convolutional neural network. The hectic process
   of segmentation and further extraction of handcrafted features is
   eliminated. The complete image is considered for the processing, thus
   incorporating every region of the brain for the classification. The
   features extracted using four cascaded layers of three
   dimensional-convolutional neural network are fed into the Support Vector
   Machine classifier. The proposed method achieved 97.77\% accuracy which
   outperforms state of the art, and this algorithm is a promising
   indicator for the diagnosis of AD.}},

   FTLD-TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh
   compound B (PiB)-PET. Braak staging, A beta plaque and neurofibrillary
   tangle counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed.
   Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a
   temporal meta region of interest (meta-ROI), entorhinal cortex and
   cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis.
   Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP
   patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden. Results
   Nine cases (37.5\%) had A beta plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with
   A beta plaque count, with 100\% specificity and 50\% sensitivity for
   diffuse plaques. Twenty-one (87.5\%) had Braak stages I to IV.
   Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal
   cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV
   or primary age-related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed
   across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir
   correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum
   across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions.
   Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although
   flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.

   Alzheimer-related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild
   Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to
   separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL 2020}},

   environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep
   learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is
   less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon
   F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography
   (FDG-PET/CT). Results The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our
   proposed network were 86.09\%, 80.00\%, and 92.96\% (respectively) using
   our dataset, and 91.02\%, 87.93\%, and 93.57\% (respectively) using the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed
   that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on
   the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur
   in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically
   significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for
   accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition,
   performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed
   no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and
   specificity (p > 0.05). Conclusions The proposed model demonstrated the
   effectiveness of AD classification using the GAP layer. Our model
   learned the AD features from PCC in both the ADNI and Severance
   datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. Furthermore, we showed that
   there were no significant differences in performance using statistical
   analysis.}},

Title = {{Identifying Early Mild Cognitive Impairment by Multi-Modality MRI-Based
   Deep Learning}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state with a high risk of
   conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since there is no effective
   treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as
   possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD.
   However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are
   only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a
   normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild
   changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on
   deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to
   identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer
   learning technique is developed to extract features of the
   multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the
   feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the
   identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2\% accuracy for
   EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that
   multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish
   EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method
   can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early
   intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as
   an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical
   diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Through the last three decades, functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) has provided immense quantities of information about the
   dynamics of the brain, functional brain mapping, and resting-state brain
   networks. Despite providing such rich functional information, fMRI is
   still not a commonly used clinical technique due to inaccuracy involved
   in analysis of extremely noisy data. However, ongoing developments in
   deep learning techniques suggest potential improvements and better
   performance in many different domains. Our main purpose is to utilize
   the potentials of deep learning techniques for fMRI data for clinical
   use.
   Approach: We present one such synergy of fMRI and deep learning, where
   we apply a simplified yet accurate method using a modified 3D
   convolutional neural networks (CNN) to resting-state fMRI data for
   feature extraction and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
   CNN is designed in such a way that it uses the fMRI data with much less
   preprocessing, preserving both spatial and temporal information.
   Results: Once trained, the network is successfully able to classify
   between fMRI data from healthy controls and AD subjects, including
   subjects in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We have also
   extracted spatiotemporal features useful for classification.
   Conclusion: This CNN can detect and differentiate between the earlier
   and later stages of MCI and AD and hence, it may have potential clinical
   applications in both early detection and better diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   disease. (C) 2020 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers

Abstract = {{Author summary There is still no cure and no effective drug treatment
   for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence,non-pharmacologicalcognitive
   intervention for patients at early stages of AD has received a lot of
   attention due to its non-invasive manner, safety, and scalability.
   Multi-domain interventions targeting memory and non-memory domains
   simultaneously are urgently needed for an optimal intervention effect on
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. However, most of the
   previous multi-domain cognitive intervention studies evaluated the
   intervention outcomes based solely on neuropsychological assessment or
   simple characterization of brain anatomical structural changes. This
   work is the first of its kind to develop a patient-specificquantitative
   analysisfor the underlyingfunctionalbrain regional activity changes
   during the multi-domain cognitive intervention process. Specifically, we
   used fMRI data from 12 patients, who were trained for three months, and
   we developed the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method
   (MG2G) to analyze these data. We obtained probabilistic changes across
   all the brain regions, and we found that brain regions in the default
   mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task
   control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal attention systems had
   relatively large variations during the non-pharmacological training.
   These fundamental insights could provide effective new biomarkers for
   monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration.
   Identifying heterogeneous cognitive impairment markers at an early stage
   is vital for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, due to complex and
   uncertain brain connectivity features in the cognitive domains, it
   remains challenging to quantify functional brain connectomic changes
   during non-pharmacological interventions for amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment (aMCI) patients. We present aquantitativemethod for
   functional brain network analysis of fMRI data based on the multi-graph
   unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G). This neural network-based
   model can effectively learn low-dimensional Gaussian distributions from
   the original high-dimensional sparse functional brain networks, quantify
   uncertainties in link prediction, and discover
   theintrinsicdimensionality of brain networks. Using the Wasserstein
   distance to measure probabilistic changes, we discovered that brain
   regions in the default mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand,
   fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal
   attention systems had relatively large variations during
   non-pharmacological training, which might provide distinct biomarkers
   for fine-grained monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration. An important
   finding of our study is the ability of the new method to capture subtle
   changes for individual patients before and after short-term
   intervention. More broadly, the MG2G method can be used in studying
   multiple brain disorders and injuries, e.g., in Parkinson's disease or
   traumatic brain injury (TBI), and hence it will be useful to the wider
   neuroscience community.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
   illnesses (dementia) among the elderly. Recently, researchers have
   developed a new method for the instinctive analysis of AD based on
   machine learning and its subfield, deep learning. Recent
   state-of-the-art techniques consider multimodal diagnosis, which has
   been shown to achieve high accuracy compared to a unimodal prognosis.
   Furthermore, many studies have used structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) to measure brain volumes and the volume of subregions, as
   well as to search for diffuse changes in white/gray matter in the brain.
   In this study, T1-weighted structural MRI was used for the early
   classification of AD. MRI results in high-intensity visible features,
   making preprocessing and segmentation easy. To use this image modality,
   we acquired four types of datasets from each dataset's server. In this
   work, we downloaded 326 subjects from the National Research Center for
   Dementia homepage, 123 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage, 121 subjects from the
   Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders homepage, and 131
   subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center homepage. In
   our experiment, we used the multiatlas label propagation with
   expectation-maximization-based refinement segmentation method. We
   segmented the images into 138 anatomical morphometry images (in which 40
   features belonged to subcortical volumes and the remaining 98 features
   belonged to cortical thickness). The entire dataset was split into a 70
   : 30 (training and testing) ratio before classifying the data. A
   principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction.
   Then, the support vector machine radial basis function classifier was
   used for classification between two groups-AD versus health control (HC)
   and early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI) versus late MCI (LMCI).
   The proposed method performed very well for all four types of dataset.
   For instance, for the AD versus HC group, the classifier achieved an
   area under curve (AUC) of more than 89\% for each dataset. For the EMCI
   versus LMCI group, the classifier achieved an AUC of more than 80\% for
   every dataset. Moreover, we also calculated Cohen kappa and Jaccard
   index statistical values for all datasets to evaluate the classification
   reliability. Finally, we compared our results with those of recently
   published state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   positron emission tomography (PET), can provide complementary structural
   and functional information of the brain, thus facilitating automated
   brain disease identification. Incomplete data problem is unavoidable in
   multi-modal neuroimage studies due to patient dropouts and/or poor data
   quality. Conventional methods usually discard data-missing subjects,
   thus significantly reducing the number of training samples. Even though
   several deep learning methods have been proposed, they usually rely on
   pre-defined regions-of-interest in neuroimages, requiring
   disease-specific expert knowledge. To this end, we propose a
   spatially-constrained Fisher representation framework for brain disease
   diagnosis with incomplete multi-modal neuroimages. We first impute
   missing PET images based on their corresponding MRI scans using a hybrid
   generative adversarial network. With the complete (after imputation) MRI
   and PET data, we then develop a spatially-constrained Fisher
   representation network to extract statistical descriptors of neuroimages
   for disease diagnosis, assuming that these descriptors follow a Gaussian
   mixture model with a strong spatial constraint (i.e., images from
   different subjects have similar anatomical structures). Experimental
   results on three databases suggest that our method can synthesize
   reasonable neuroimages and achieve promising results in brain disease
   identification, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.}},

   using large-scale population-based diffusion imaging}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{218}},
Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Subtle changes in white matter (WM) microstructure have been associated
   with normal aging and neuro-degeneration. To study these associations in
   more detail, it is highly important that the WM tracts can be accurately
   and reproducibly characterized from brain diffusion MRI. In addition, to
   enable analysis of WM tracts in large datasets and in clinical practice
   it is essential to have methodology that is fast and easy to apply. This
   work therefore presents a new approach for WM tract segmentation:
   Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct extraction of WM tracts from
   diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural network (CNN). This
   3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in aging
   individuals from a large population-based study (N = 9752, 1.5T MRI).
   The proposed method showed good segmentation performance and high
   reproducibility, i.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, kappa =
   0.72-0.83) and a low scan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion
   measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy: epsilon = 1\%-5\%). The
   reproducibility of the proposed method was higher than that of a
   tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being orders of
   magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed
   that the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an
   external dementia dataset (N = 58, 3T MRI). In two proof-of-principle
   experiments, we associated WM microstructure ob-tained using the
   proposed method with age in a normal elderly population, and with
   disease subtypes in a dementia cohort. In concordance with the
   literature, results showed a widespread reduction of microstructural
   organization with aging and substantial group-wise microstructure
   differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we presented a
   highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that has
   the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical
   practice.}},

   than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p< 0.007).
   beta-amyloid (A beta)-moderated sex differences in tau signal were
   localized to medial and inferio-lateral temporal regions (p< 0.007); A

   Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal

   decline. Interactive effects of sex and A beta were predominantly
   localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging a neuroimaging technique which is
   used in brain disorders and dysfunction studies, has been improved in
   recent years by mapping the topology of the brain connections, named
   connectopic mapping. Based on the fact that healthy and unhealthy brain
   regions and functions differ slightly, studying the complex topology of
   the functional and structural networks in the human brain is too
   complicated considering the growth of evaluation measures. One of the
   applications of irregular graph deep learning is to analyze the human
   cognitive functions related to the gene expression and related
   distributed spatial patterns. Since a variety of brain solutions can be
   dynamically held in the neuronal networks of the brain with different
   activity patterns and functional connectivity, both node-centric and
   graph-centric tasks are involved in this application. In this study, we
   used an individual generative model and high order graph analysis for
   the region of interest recognition areas of the brain with abnormal
   connection during performing certain tasks and resting-state or
   decompose irregular observations. Accordingly, a high order framework of
   Variational Graph Autoencoder with a Gaussian distributer was proposed
   in the paper to analyze the functional data in brain imaging studies in
   which Generative Adversarial Network is employed for optimizing the
   latent space in the process of learning strong non-rigid graphs among
   large scale data. Furthermore, the possible modes of correlations were
   distinguished in abnormal brain connections. Our goal was to find the
   degree of correlation between the affected regions and their
   simultaneous occurrence over time. We can take advantage of this to
   diagnose brain diseases or show the ability of the nervous system to
   modify brain topology at all angles and brain plasticity according to
   input stimuli. In this study, we particularly focused on Alzheimer's
   disease.}},

Abstract = {{The convolutional neural network (CNN) model is an active research topic
   in the field of EEG signals analysis. However, the classification effect
   of CNN on EEG signals of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with
   type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not ideal. Even if EEG signals are
   transformed into multispectral images that are more closely matched with
   the model, the best classification performance can not be achieved.
   Therefore, to improve the performance of CNN toward EEG multispectral
   image classification, a multi-view convolutional neural network (MVCNN)
   classification model based on inceptionV1 is designed in this study.
   This model mainly improves and optimizes the convolutional layers and
   stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the convolutional architecture
   model. Firstly, based on the discreteness of EEG multispectral image
   features, the multi-view convolutional layer structure was proposed.
   Then the learning rate change function of the SGD was optimized to
   increase the classification performance. The multi-view convolutional
   nerve was used in an EEG multispectral classification task involving 19
   aMCI with T2DM and 20 normal controls. The results showed that compared
   with the traditional classification models, MVCNN had a better stability
   and accuracy. Therefore, MVCNN could be used as an effective feature

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel method for mild cognitive impairment

   network measures tailored to describe the altered brain connectivity. In
   turn, the brain reconstruction is obtained by combining

   other hand, artificial neural networks provide a means to learn a
   mapping from topological properties of the brain to the presence or
   absence of cognitive decline. The effectiveness of the method is studied
   on a well-known benchmark data set in order to evaluate if it can

Abstract = {{Early identification of dementia at the stage of mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although several pioneering studies have been
   devoted to automated AD diagnosis based on resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their performance is somewhat
   limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal dependency.
   Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit
   detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network
   hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a
   unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet)
   for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection
   from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal
   information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep
   learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series
   into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of
   convolutional components are then designed to capture the
   local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window,
   based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and
   characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A
   recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further
   employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the
   spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal
   dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 174 subjects
   with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of
   our method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and
   AD-related hub detection.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible devastative
   neurodegenerative disorder associated with progressive impairment of
   memory and cognitive functions. Its early diagnosis is crucial for the
   development of possible future treatment option(s). Structural magnetic
   resonance images (sMRI) play an important role to help in understanding
   the anatomical changes related to AD especially in its early stages.
   Conventional methods require the expertise of domain experts and extract
   hand-picked features such as gray matter substructures and train a
   classifier to distinguish AD subjects from healthy subjects. Different
   from these methods, this paper proposes to construct multiple deep 2D
   convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) to learn the various features
   from local brain images which are combined to make the final
   classification for AD diagnosis. The whole brain image was passed
   through two transfer learning architectures; Inception version 3 and
   Xception, as well as a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built
   with the help of separable convolutional layers which can automatically
   learn the generic features from imaging data for classification. Our
   study is conducted using cross-sectional T1-weighted structural MRI
   brain images from Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database

   results show that the transfer learning approaches exceed the
   performance of non-transfer learning-based approaches demonstrating the
   effectiveness of these approaches for the binary AD classification task.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Alzheimer's disease is a fatal brain condition that causes

   Neural Network (CNN) are not satisfactory enough for large datasets.
   Methods This paper suggests a solution based on Amalgamation of deep
   learning models. The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scan data from the
   Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) Brain, has been used for
   experimental purposes. The first phase focuses on implementing the
   primary models i.e., CNN, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Long
   Short Term Memory (LSTM). The second phase implements ensemble technique
   to combine these three models using a weighted average approach. An
   approach called Bagging is applied in all the three models to decrease
   the variance and the three Bagged models are combined using the ensemble
   method. Results The results show that the ensemble of CNN, RNN, and LSTM
   achieved an accuracy of 89.75\% whereas the ensemble after Bagging the
   primary models achieved an accuracy of 92.22\%. Conclusion On
   comparison, the ensemble of Bagged models achieved better results than

Title = {{Multi-modal neuroimaging feature fusion for diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{341}},
Month = {{JUL 15}},
Abstract = {{Background: Compared with single-modal neuroimages classification of AD,
   multi-modal classification can achieve better performance by fusing
   different information. Exploring synergy among various multi-modal
   neuroimages is contributed to identifying the pathological process of
   neurological disorders. However, it is still problematic to effectively
   exploit multi-modal information since the lack of an effective fusion
   method.
   New method: In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal fusion network
   based on the attention mechanism, which can selectively extract features
   from MRI and PET branches and suppress irrelevant information. In the
   attention model, the fusion ratio of each modality is assigned
   automatically according to the importance of the data. A hierarchical
   fusion method is adopted to ensure the effectiveness of Multi-modal
   Fusion.
   Results: Evaluating the model on the ADNI dataset, the experimental
   results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In
   particular, the final classification results of the NC/AD, SMCI/PMCI and
   Four-Class are 95.21 \%, 89.79 \%, and 86.15 \%, respectively.
   Comparison with existing methods: Different from the early fusion and
   the late fusion, the hierarchical fusion method contributes to learning
   the synergy between the multi-modal data. Compared with some other
   prominent algorithms, the attention model enables our network to focus
   on the regions of interest and effectively fuse the multi-modal data.
   Conclusion: Benefit from the hierarchical structure with attention
   model, the proposed network is capable of exploiting low-level and
   high-level features extracted from the multi-modal data and improving
   the accuracy of AD diagnosis. Results show its promising performance.}},

Abstract = {{With the increasing size of datasets used in medical imaging research,
   the need for automated data curation is arising. One important data
   curation task is the structured organization of a dataset for preserving

   convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically recognizes eight
   different brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan types based on
   visual appearance. Thus, our method is unaffected by inconsistent or
   missing scan metadata. It can recognize pre-contrast T1-weighted

   density-weighted (PDw) and derived maps (e.g. apparent diffusion
   coefficient and cerebral blood flow). In a first experiment,we used
   scans of subjects with brain tumors: 11065 scans of 719 subjects for
   training, and 2369 scans of 192 subjects for testing. The CNN achieved
   an overall accuracy of 98.7\%. In a second experiment, we trained the
   CNN on all 13434 scans from the first experiment and tested it on 7227
   scans of 1318 Alzheimer's subjects. Here, the CNN achieved an overall
   accuracy of 98.5\%. In conclusion, our method can accurately predict

Title = {{tDCS effects on brain network properties during physiological aging}},
Journal = {{PFLUGERS ARCHIV-EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY}},
Abstract = {{Brain neural networks undergo relevant changes during physiological
   aging, which affect cognitive and behavioral functions. Currently,
   non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct
   current stimulation (tDCS), are proposed as tools able to modulate
   cognitive functions in brain aging, acting on networks properties and
   connectivity. Segregation and integration measures are used and
   evaluated by means of local clustering (segregation) and path length
   (integration). Moreover, to assess the balancing between them, the Small
   World (SW) parameter is employed, evaluating functional coupling in
   normal brain aging and in pathological conditions including
   neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to systematically
   investigate the tDCS-induced effects on brain network proprieties in
   physiological aging. In order to reach this aim, cortical activity was
   acquired from healthy young and elderly subjects by means of EEG
   recorded before, during, and after anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS
   sessions. Specifically, the aim to exploring tDCS polarity-dependent
   changes in the age-dependent network dynamics was based on a network
   graph theory application on two groups divided in young and elderly
   subjects. Eighteen healthy young (9 females; mean age = 24.7, SD = 3.2)
   and fifteen elderly subjects (9 females; mean = 70.1, SD = 5.1) were
   enrolled. Each participant received anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over
   the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in three separate experimental sessions
   performed 1 week apart. SW was computed to evaluate brain network
   organization. The present study demonstrates that tDCS delivered in PFC
   can change brain network dynamics, and tDCS-EEG coregistration data can
   be analyzed using graph theory to understand the induced effects of
   different tDCS polarities in physiological and pathological brain aging.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Our study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system
   can predict the rate of cognitive decline in mildly cognitively impaired
   patients by processing only the clinical and imaging data collected at
   the initial visit.
   Approach: We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid
   neural network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural
   network to perform volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   and integration of nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer
   of the architecture. The experiments are conducted on the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset.
   Results: Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation
   between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The
   system achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.70 for
   cognitive decline class prediction.
   Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that predicts
   ``slowly deteriorating/stable{''} or ``rapidly deteriorating{''} classes
   by processing routinely collected baseline clinical and demographic data
   {[}baseline MRI, baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), scalar

   signatures of normal brain ageing as well as of various
   neuropathological processes associated with brain diseases. In
   particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive
   biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient
   ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging
   signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and
   Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning.
   Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for
   sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by
   insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain
   ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across
   populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a
   sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11
   729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning
   different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the
   world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication
   cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust
   brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for
   specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show
   evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age
   estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies.
   This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally
   produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age,
   and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer
   some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting
   models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain
   significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models
   in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate
   that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to
   construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared
   to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control
   datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We,
   therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the
   need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep
   learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to
   the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general
   population and over the lifespan.}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests the utility of magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) as an important technique for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) and for predicting the onset of this neurodegenerative disorder. In
   this study, we present a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model of
   great accuracy to diagnose the early stages of AD. A total of 373 MRI
   tests belonging to 150 subjects (age >= 60) were examined and analyzed
   in parallel with fourteen distinct features related to standard AD
   diagnosis. Four ML models, such as naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural
   networks (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support-vector machines
   (SVM), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric were
   used to validate the model performance. Each model evaluation was done
   in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, a manual
   feature selection was used for model training, and ANN generated the
   highest accuracy in terms of ROC (0.812). In the second experiment,
   automatic feature selection was conducted by wrapping methods, and the
   NB achieved the highest ROC of 0.942. The last experiment consisted of
   an ensemble or hybrid modeling developed to combine the four models.
   This approach resulted in an improved accuracy ROC of 0.991. We conclude
   that the involvement of ensemble modeling, coupled with selective
   features, can predict with better accuracy the development of AD at an
   early stage.}},

Abstract = {{Segmentation of the hippocampus (HC) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   is an essential step for diagnosis and monitoring of several clinical
   situations such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and epilepsy.
   Automatic segmentation of HC structures is challenging due to their
   small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries.
   The active contour model (ACM) with a statistical shape prior is robust.
   However, it is difficult to build a shape prior that is general enough
   to cover all possible shapes of the HC and that suffers the problems of
   complicated registration of the shape prior and the target object and of
   low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic model that
   combines a deep belief network (DBN) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB)
   method for the segmentation of HC. The training process of DBN consists
   of unsupervised bottom-up training and supervised training of a top
   restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Given an input image, the trained
   DBN is utilized to infer the patient-specific shape prior of the HC. The
   specific shape prior is not only used to determine the initial contour,
   but is also introduced into the LB model as part of the external force
   to refine the segmentation. We used a subset of OASIS-1 as the training
   set and the preliminary release of EADC-ADNI as the testing set. The
   segmentation results of our method have good correlation and consistency
   with the manual segmentation results.}},

Abstract = {{Brain network provides essential insights in diagnosing many brain
   disorders. Integrative analysis of multiple types of connectivity, e.g,
   functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC), can take
   advantage of their complementary information and therefore may help to
   identify patients. However, traditional brain network methods usually
   focus on either FC or SC for describing node interactions and only
   consider the interaction between paired network nodes. To tackle this
   problem, in this paper, we propose an Attention-Diffusion-Bilinear
   Neural Network (ADB-NN) framework for brain network analysis, which is
   trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed network seamlessly couples
   FC and SC to learn wider node interactions and generates a joint
   representation of FC and SC for diagnosis. Specifically, a brain network
   (graph) is first defined, where each node corresponding to a brain
   region is governed by the features of brain activities (i.e., FC)
   extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the
   presence of edges is determined by neural fiber physical connections
   (i.e., SC) extracted from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Based on this
   graph, we train two Attention-Diffusion-Bilinear (ADB) modules jointly.
   In each module, an attention model is utilized to automatically learn
   the strength of node interactions. This information further guides a
   diffusion process that generates new node representations by considering
   the influence from other nodes as well. After that, the second-order
   statistics of these node representations are extracted by bilinear
   pooling to form connectivity-based features for disease prediction. The
   two ADB modules correspond to the one-step and two-step diffusion,
   respectively. Experiments on a real epilepsy dataset demonstrate the
   effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.}},

Abstract = {{As a hot topic in brain disease prognosis, predicting clinical measures
   of subjects based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data helps
   to assess the stage of pathology and predict future development of the
   disease. Due to incomplete clinical labels/scores, previous
   learning-based studies often simply discard subjects without
   ground-truth scores. This would result in limited training data for
   learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods focus only
   on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume)
   of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with
   prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised densely
   connected neural network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using
   baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first
   extract multiscale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from
   MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and
   then develop a weakly supervised densely connected network for
   task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of
   multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed
   to make full use of all available subjects (even those without
   ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training. The

Abstract = {{Functional connectivity networks (FCNs) based on functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) have been widely applied to analyzing and
   diagnosing brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its
   prodrome stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing studies
   usually use Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) method to construct
   FCNs, and then extract network measures (e.g., clustering coefficients)
   as features to learn a diagnostic model. However, the valuable
   observation information in network construction (e.g., specific
   contributions of different time points), as well as high-level and
   high-order network features are neglected in these studies. In this
   paper, we first define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called
   wc-kernel) to measure the correlation of brain regions, by which
   weighting factors are learned in a data-driven manner to characterize
   the contributions of different time points, thus conveying the richer
   interaction information among brain regions compared with the PCC
   method. Furthermore, we build a wc-kernel based convolutional neural
   network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for learning the hierarchical
   (Le., from local to global and also from low-level to high-level)
   features for disease diagnosis, by using fMRI data. Specifically, we

   wc-kernels. Then, we define another three layers to sequentially extract
   local (brain region specific), global (brain network specific) and
   temporal features from the constructed dynamic FCNs for classification.

   Overview and reproducible evaluation}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},

Abstract = {{Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for
   automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging
   data. In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional
   neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI.
   However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across
   studies due to variations in components such as participant selection,
   image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are
   hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible
   and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these
   papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear
   validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to
   address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we
   performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types
   of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and
   iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the
   surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported
   biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our
   open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted
   MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically
   convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular
   set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and
   evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this
   framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data
   was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and
   only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To
   avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end
   of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches
   (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that
   of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN
   approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features.
   The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not
   to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical
   characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments is
   publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the
   Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is

Abstract = {{Cortical neural networks maintain autonomous electrical activity called
   spontaneous activity that represents the brain's dynamic internal state
   even in the absence of sensory stimuli. The spatio-temporal complexity
   of spontaneous activity is strongly related to perceptual, learning, and
   cognitive brain functions; multi-fractal analysis can be utilized to
   evaluate the complexity of spontaneous activity. Recent studies have
   shown that the deterministic dynamic behavior of spontaneous activity
   especially reflects the topological neural network characteristics and
   changes of neural network structures. However, it remains unclear
   whether multi-fractal analysis, recently widely utilized for neural
   activity, is effective for detecting the complexity of the deterministic
   dynamic process. To verify this point, we focused on the log-normal
   distribution of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to evaluate
   the multi-fractality of spontaneous activity in a spiking neural network
   with a log-normal distribution of EPSPs. We found that the spiking
   activities exhibited multi-fractal characteristics. Moreover, to
   investigate the presence of a deterministic process in the spiking
   activity, we conducted a surrogate data analysis against the time-series
   of spiking activity. The results showed that the spontaneous spiking
   activity included the deterministic dynamic behavior. Overall, the
   combination of multi-fractal analysis and surrogate data analysis can
   detect deterministic complex neural activity. The multi-fractal analysis
   of neural activity used in this study could be widely utilized for brain
   modeling and evaluation methods for signals obtained by neuroimaging

Abstract = {{Background: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with
   poorer cognitive function and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). However, objective evidence for the relationship between
   osteoporosis and AD in humans has not been extensively described.
   Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the relationships between BMD and the
   cortical volumes of brain regions vulnerable to AD; hippocampus,
   parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and angular
   gyrus, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), to investigate the
   association between bone loss and AD. Methods: A cohort of 149
   consecutive elderly participants who complained of memory disturbance
   underwent high-resolution structural brain magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We used SPM12 software
   to conduct a voxel-based multiple regression analysis to examine the
   association between femoral neck BMD values and regional gray matter
   volume (rGMV) on structural T1-weighted MRI. Results: After adjusting
   for subject age, gender, total brain volume (TBV), and mini-mental state
   examination (MMSE) scores, the multiple regression analysis showed
   significant correlations between BMD loss and rGMV decline in the left
   precuneus, which is an important neural network hub vulnerable to AD.

Abstract = {{Purpose We aimed to evaluate the performance of deep learning-based
   generalization of ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI enhancement when
   applied to studies acquired with different scanning hardware and
   protocols. Methods Eighty simultaneous {[}F-18]florbetaben PET/MRI
   studies were acquired, split equally between two sites (site 1: Signa
   PET/MRI, GE Healthcare, 39 participants, 67 +/- 8 years, 23 females;
   site 2: mMR, Siemens Healthineers, 64 +/- 11 years, 23 females) with
   different MRI protocols. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET data (90-110
   min post-injection) were reconstructed as ground-truth. Ultra-low-count
   data obtained from undersampling by a factor of 100 (site 1) or the
   first minute of PET acquisition (site 2) were reconstructed for
   ultra-low-dose/ultra-short-time (1\% dose and 5\% time, respectively)
   PET images. A deep convolution neural network was pre-trained with site
   1 data and either (A) directly applied or (B) trained further on site 2
   data using transfer learning. Networks were also trained from scratch
   based on (C) site 2 data or (D) all data. Certified physicians
   determined amyloid uptake (+/-) status for accuracy and scored the image
   quality. The peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and
   root-mean-squared error were calculated between images and their
   ground-truth counterparts. Mean regional standardized uptake value
   ratios (SUVR, reference region: cerebellar cortex) from 37 successful
   site 2 FreeSurfer segmentations were analyzed. Results All
   network-synthesized images had reduced noise than their ultra-low-count
   reconstructions. Quantitatively, image metrics improved the most using
   method B, where SUVRs had the least variability from the ground-truth
   and the highest effect size to differentiate between positive and
   negative images. Method A images had lower accuracy and image quality
   than other methods; images synthesized from methods B-D scored similarly
   or better than the ground-truth images. Conclusions Deep learning can
   successfully produce diagnostic amyloid PET images from short frame
   reconstructions. Data bias should be considered when applying
   pre-trained deep ultra-low-count amyloid PET/MRI networks for
   generalization.}},

Abstract = {{Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular
   dementia (VD) are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple
   neurological symptoms that may lead to controversial diagnoses when
   using conventional clinical and MRI criteria. Therefore, other
   approaches are needed to overcome this issue. Machine learning (ML)
   combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to improve
   the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, including
   dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether
   different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features,
   could be supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the
   developed approach might help in predicting the prevalent disease in
   subjects with an unclear profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of
   algorithms were tested: artificial neural network (ANN), support vector
   machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS).
   Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were used
   as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature
   pattern to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD-AD
   discriminant feature pattern as input for the most performant ML
   algorithm to predict the disease prevalence in 15 dementia patients with
   a ``mixed VD-AD dementia{''} (MXD) clinical profile using their baseline
   MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the diagnosis evidence from
   a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most efficient
   algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification
   accuracy greater than 84\% using a small feature pattern. Moreover,
   ANFIS showed improved classification accuracy when trained with a
   multimodal input feature data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather
   than a unimodal feature data set. When applying the best discriminant
   pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a correct prediction rate of
   77.33\%. Overall, results showed that our approach has a high
   discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same
   approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent
   underlying disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is
   uncertain between AD and VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in
   supporting physicians' diagnostic evaluations.}},

Abstract = {{Precision medicine for Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the
   development of personalized, reproducible, and neuroscientifically
   interpretable biomarkers, yet despite remarkable advances, few such
   biomarkers are available. Also, a comprehensive evaluation of the
   neurobiological basis and generalizability of the end-to-end machine
   learning system should be given the highest priority. For this reason, a
   deep learning model (3D attention network, 3DAN) that can simultaneously
   capture candidate imaging biomarkers with an attention mechanism module
   and advance the diagnosis of AD based on structural magnetic resonance
   imaging is proposed. The generalizability and reproducibility are
   evaluated using cross-validation on in-house, multicenter (n = 716), and
   public (n = 1116) databases with an accuracy up to 92\%. Significant
   associations between the classification output and clinical
   characteristics of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a middle stage
   of dementia) groups provide solid neurobiological support for the 3DAN
   model. The effectiveness of the 3DAN model is further validated by its
   good performance in predicting the MCI subjects who progress to AD with
   an accuracy of 72\%. Collectively, the findings highlight the potential

   Daubechies discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used, coupled with
   analysis of the correlations between biomedical signals that measure the
   electrical activity in the brain by electroencephalogram (EEG),
   electrical currents generated in muscles by electromyogram (EMG), and
   heart rate monitoring by photoplethysmography (PPG). In addition, we
   used artificial neural networks (ANN) for automatic detection of

   before a seizure and during the seizure for 30 patients with epilepsy.
   In this work, we investigated the ANN dimensions of 10, 50, 100, and 150

Abstract = {{Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, the
   authors identified 2582 18F-florbetapir PET scans, which were separated
   into positive and negative cases by using a standardized uptake value
   ratio threshold of 1.1. They trained convolutional neural networks to
   predict standardized uptake value ratio and classify amyloid status. The
   best performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before
   classification, 3 input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized
   uptake value ratio root-mean-squared error of 0.054, corresponding to
   95.1\% correct amyloid status prediction. The best trained network was
   more accurate than humans (96\% versus a mean of 88\%, respectively).
   They conclude that deep learning algorithms can estimate standardized
   uptake value ratio and use this to classify 18F-florbetapir PET scans
   and have promise to automate this laborious calculation.
   BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical amyloid quantification on PET by using
   the standardized uptake value ratio is valuable for research studies and
   clinical trials in Alzheimer disease. However, it is resource intensive,
   requiring co-registered MR imaging data and specialized segmentation
   software. We investigated the use of deep learning to automatically
   quantify standardized uptake value ratio and used this for
   classification.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative dataset, we identified 2582 F-18-florbetapir PET scans, which
   were separated into positive and negative cases by using a standardized
   uptake value ratio threshold of 1.1. We trained convolutional neural
   networks (ResNet-50 and ResNet-152) to predict standardized uptake value
   ratio and classify amyloid status. We assessed performance based on
   network depth, number of PET input slices, and use of ImageNet
   pretraining. We also assessed human performance with 3 readers in a
   subset of 100 randomly selected cases.
   RESULTS: We have found that 48\% of cases were amyloid positive. The
   best performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before
   classification, 3 input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized
   uptake value ratio root-mean-square error of 0.054, corresponding to
   95.1\% correct amyloid status prediction. Using more than 3 slices did
   not improve performance, but ImageNet initialization did. The best
   trained network was more accurate than humans (96\% versus a mean of
   88\%, respectively).
   CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning algorithms can estimate standardized uptake
   value ratio and use this to classify F-18-florbetapir PET scans. Such
   methods have promise to automate this laborious calculation, enabling
   quantitative measurements rapidly and in settings without extensive
   image processing manpower and expertise.}},

Abstract = {{Quantification of anatomical shape changes currently relies on scalar
   global indexes which are largely insensitive to regional or asymmetric
   modifications. Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical
   remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many
   conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success
   in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the
   feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a
   new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular,
   we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical
   segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At
   the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is
   simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions,
   enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover,
   the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space
   can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative
   properties of the model, making the classification task transparent.
   This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and
   remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our
   own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and
   on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's
   disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the
   visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical
   features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam.
   The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations,
   facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in
   large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.}},

Abstract = {{Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a common
   neuro-developmental disorder of childhood. In this study we propose two
   classification algorithms for discriminating ADHD children from normal
   children using their resting state Electroencephalography (EEG) signals.
   One algorithm is based on the univariate features extracted from
   individual EEG recording channels and the other is based on the
   multivariate features extracted from brain lobes. We focused on entropy
   measures as non-linear univariate and multivariate features. Average
   power, Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR), Shannon Entropy (ShanEn), Sample Entropy
   (SampEn), Dispersion Entropy (DispEn) and Multiscale SampEn (MSE) were
   extracted as linear and non-linear univariate features. Besides,
   multivariate SampEn (mvSE) and multivariate MSE (mvMSE) were extracted
   as non-linear multivariate features. Classification was followed by
   three classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels,
   k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN).
   Complexity analysis of multi-channel EEG data was performed using mvMSE
   approach. Entropy mapping as a useful tool was used to visually track
   changes of entropies in various brain regions. Based on achieved
   results, ADHD children have higher brain activity and TBR compared to
   normal children, while their neural system is more regular. Besides,
   ADHD children have reduced dynamical complexity of neural system.
   Finally, the accuracy of 99.58\% was achieved in classification based on
   a combination of non-linear univariate features by Radial Basis Function
   (RBF) SVM. For classification based on brain regions using multivariate
   features, 90.63\% accuracy was achieved by PNN.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of dementia worldwide, with an
   increasing morbidity burden that may outstrip diagnosis and management
   capacity as the population ages. Current methods integrate patient
   history, neuropsychological testing and MRI to identify likely cases,
   yet effective practices remain variably applied and lacking in
   sensitivity and specificity. Here we report an interpretable deep
   learning strategy that delineates unique Alzheimer's disease signatures
   from multimodal inputs of MRI, age, gender, and Mini-Mental State
   Examination score. Our framework linked a fully convolutional network,
   which constructs high resolution maps of disease probability from local
   brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and generates precise,
   intuitive visualization of individual Alzheimer's disease risk en route
   to accurate diagnosis. The model was trained using clinically diagnosed
   Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 417) and validated
   on three independent cohorts: the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and
   Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) (n = 382), the Framingham
   Heart Study (n = 102), and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center
   (NACC) (n = 582). Performance of the model that used the multimodal
   inputs was consistent across datasets, with mean area under curve values
   of 0.996, 0.974, 0.876 and 0.954 for the ADNI study, AIBL, Framingham
   Heart Study and NACC datasets, respectively. Moreover, our approach
   exceeded the diagnostic performance of a multi-institutional team of
   practicing neurologists (n = 11), and high-risk cerebral regions
   predicted by the model closely tracked post-mortem histopathological

Abstract = {{Objective. The purpose of this study is to judge whether this
   combination method of multispectral image and convolutional neural
   network (CNN) method can be used to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment (aMCI) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normal
   controls (NC) with T2DM effectively. Approach. In this study, the
   authors first combined EEG signals from aMCI patients with T2DM and NC
   with T2DM on five different frequency bands, including Theta, Alpha1,
   Alpha2, Beta1, and Beta2. Then, the authors converted these time series
   into a series of multispectral images. Finally, the images data were
   classified with the CNN method. Main results. The classification effects
   of up to 89\%, 91\%, and 92\% are obtained on the three combinations of
   frequency bands: Theta, Alpha1, and Alpha2; Alpha1, Alpha2, and Beta1;
   and Alpha2, Beta1, and Beta2. The spatial properties of EEG signals are
   highlighted, and its classification performance is found to be better
   than all the previous methods in the field of aMCI and T2DM diagnosis.
   The combination of multispectral images and CNN can be used as an
   effective biomarker for distinguishing the EEG signals in patients with
   aMCI and T2DM and in patients with NC with T2DM. Significance. The
   combined approach used in this paper provides a new perspective for the
   analysis of EEG signals in patients with aMCI and T2DM.}},

Abstract = {{Traditional researches assume that brain functional networks are static
   during the entire scanning process of functional magnetic resonance
   image (fMRI) in the resting state. However, it is not difficult to
   ignore the dynamic interaction patterns of brain regions that
   essentially change across time. In this study, we take the internal
   weight information of the brain functional network as a calculation
   condition of module dividing for brain functional networks. The concept
   of betweenness efficiency is firstly proposed to improve Girvan-Newman
   (GN) algorithm for a better module dividing result, and the maximum
   modularity is used as a criterion to classify the brain functional
   network modules of normal subjects. The effect of the improved method is
   verified by controlling subjects, parameters, environment and other
   conditions. Then, the improved method was utilized to separate the
   modules in brain functional networks of normal subjects, and the
   template was used to divide the functional network of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) sufferers. The
   shortest path length of each module is calculated, and the experimental
   results are compared with the original GN and weighted GN algorithm
   improved by Newman. The experimental results demonstrate that, the
   maximum modularity of the improved method is higher while the dividing
   effect is better under the same conditions. Meanwhile, the conclusion is
   consistent with the existing research results when the proposed method
   is applicable to the analysis of the shortest path length. These results
   illustrate the viewpoint that the proposed method of module dividing is
   feasible in the analysis of modular structure of brain functional
   network.}},

Abstract = {{In the context of neuro-pathological disorders, neuroimaging has been
   widely accepted as a clinical tool for diagnosing patients with
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The
   advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was
   applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the
   diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural
   networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to
   execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset
   from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to
   compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support
   vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes
   of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and
   3D-CNN-SVM were 82.57 +/- 7.35\%, 89.76 +/- 8.67\% and 95.74 +/- 2.31\%
   respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy
   of 93.71\%, 96.82\% and 96.73\% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses,
   respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for
   binary classification. Our study indicated that `NC versus MCI' showed
   accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90\%, 98.90\% and 98.80\%;
   `NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10\%,
   99.80\% and 98.40\%; and `MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity
   and specificity of 89.40\%, 86.70\% and 84.00\%, respectively. This
   study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance
   with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In
   addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually
   perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the
   variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can
   potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual
   patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness
   and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve
   as an effective screening option for AD in the general population. This
   study holds value in distinguishing AD and MCI subjects from normal
   controls and to improve value-based care of patients in clinical
   practice.}},

Abstract = {{Convolutional neural network (CNN) models have recently demonstrated
   impressive performance in medical image analysis. However, there is no
   clear understanding of why they perform so well, or what they have
   learned. In this paper, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network
   (3D-CNN) is employed to classify brain MRI scans into two predefined
   groups. In addition, a genetic algorithm based brain masking (GABM)
   method is proposed as a visualization technique that provides new
   insights into the function of the 3D-CNN. The proposed GABM method
   consists of two main steps. In the first step, a set of brain MRI scans
   is used to train the 3D-CNN. In the second step, a genetic algorithm
   (GA) is applied to discover knowledgeable brain regions in the MRI
   scans. The knowledgeable regions are those areas of the brain which the
   3D-CNN has mostly used to extract important and discriminative features
   from them. For applying GA on the brain MRI scans, a new chromosome
   encoding approach is proposed. The proposed framework has been evaluated
   using ADNI (including 140 subjects for Alzheimer's disease
   classification) and ABIDE (including 1000 subjects for Autism
   classification) brain MRI datasets. Experimental results show a 5-fold
   classification accuracy of 0.85 for the ADNI dataset and 0.70 for the
   ABIDE dataset. The proposed GABM method has extracted 6 to 65
   knowledgeable brain regions in ADNI dataset (and 15 to 75 knowledgeable
   brain regions in ABIDE dataset). These regions are interpreted as the
   segments of the brain which are mostly used by the 3D-CNN to extract
   features for brain disease classification. Experimental results show
   that besides the model interpretability, the proposed GABM method has
   increased final performance of the classification model in some cases
   with respect to model parameters. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Month = {{JUN 1}},
Abstract = {{Background: The unparalleled performance of deep learning approaches in
   generic image processing has motivated its extension to neuroimaging
   data. These approaches learn abstract neuroanatomical and functional
   brain alterations that could enable exceptional performance in
   classification of brain disorders, predicting disease progression, and
   localizing brain abnormalities.
   New Method: This work investigates the suitability of a modified form of
   deep residual neural networks (ResNet) for studying neuroimaging data in
   the specific application of predicting progression from mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prediction was conducted
   first by training the deep models using MCI individuals only, followed
   by a domain transfer learning version that additionally trained on AD
   and controls. We also demonstrate a network occlusion based method to
   localize abnormalities.
   Results: The implemented framework captured non-linear features that
   successfully predicted AD progression and also conformed to the spectrum
   of various clinical scores. In a repeated cross-validated setup, the
   learnt predictive models showed highly similar peak activations that
   corresponded to previous AD reports.
   Comparison with existing methods: The implemented architecture achieved
   a significant performance improvement over the classical support vector
   machine and the stacked autoencoder frameworks (p < 0.005), numerically
   better than state-of-the-art performance using sMRI data alone ( > 7\%
   than the second-best performing method) and within 1\% of the
   state-of-the-art performance considering learning using multiple
   neuroimaging modalities as well.
   Conclusions: The explored frameworks reflected the high potential of
   deep learning architectures in learning subtle predictive features and
   utility in critical applications such as predicting and understanding
   disease progression.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Preclinical evidence with nilotinib, a US Food and Drug
   Administration (FDA)-approved drug for leukemia, indicates improvement
   in Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. We investigated whether nilotinib is
   safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and
   clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease.
   Methods This single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind,
   placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and
   pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants
   with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis
   was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission
   tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was
   taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus
   placebo for another 26 weeks.
   Results Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD)
   age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well-tolerated, although more
   adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg
   dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid
   burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the
   placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid A beta 40 was reduced at 6 months and
   A beta 42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to
   the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (-27\%) at 12 months
   and phospho-tau-181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the
   nilotinib group.
   Interpretation Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant
   cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the clinical precursor of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), which is considered the most common neurodegenerative
   disease in the elderly. Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over
   time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its
   early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study,
   we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning
   method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this
   purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked
   to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF)
   tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (Delta HbO)
   in the region of interest, Delta HbO maps at 13 specific time points
   (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during
   the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean,
   three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex
   were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was
   applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually,
   after training the CNN model with Delta HbO maps and temporal feature
   maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to
   evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature
   maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies
   for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46,
   87.80, and 90.37\%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61\% was
   achieved from the Delta HbO slope map during 20-60 s interval of N-back
   tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on
   temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early
   detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to
   identify MCI from their patients.}},

   A Novel Approach Combining Convolutional Neural Networks and Ensemble

Abstract = {{Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common
   practice. Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied
   to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to
   its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a
   variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has
   shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance
   via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble
   developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to
   identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between
   (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will
   convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not
   convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of
   CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or
   transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a
   single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using
   stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of
   the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices
   separating two classes in a binary classification task among the
   sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the
   standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an
   indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points
   were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most
   intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the
   early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 +/-
   0.05, 0.79 +/- 0.04, and 0.62 +/- 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD
   vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports
   and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more
   state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using
   channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately
   located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the
   limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More
   interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes
   in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results
   suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach
   can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained
   ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model
   was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early
   in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into
   understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in
   AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of
   the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help
   understand and evaluate an individual subject's disease status, symptom
   burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL
   approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection
   of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe
   depression, in a data-driven way.}},

Abstract = {{Applying machine learning methods to various modality medical images and
   clinical data for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its
   prodromal stage has many significant results. So far, the image data
   input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some
   functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and
   time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image
   processing algorithm, these 4D data were always used by transforming
   them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures
   which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D
   deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to
   utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by
   dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a
   series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial
   features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence.
   Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory
   (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the
   data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end
   data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI
   data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative
   dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments.
   Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method
   did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using
   functional connectivity, 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our
   assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal
   information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection
   and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result
   implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for
   processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of
   fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder.
   Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD and its
   identification is very crucial for early treatment. MCI to AD conversion
   is of imperative concern in current Alzheimer's research. In this study,
   we have investigated the conversion from MCI to AD using different types
   of features. The impact of structural changes in entire brain tissues
   captured through MRI, genetics, neuropsychological assessment scores and
   their combination are investigated. Computational cost can be
   significantly reduced by examining only the hippocampi region, atrophy
   of which is visible in the earliest stages of the disease. We proposed a
   CNN based deep learning approach for the prediction of conversion from
   MCI to AD using above mentioned features. Highest accuracy is achieved
   when left hippocampus is used as a region of interest (ROI). The
   proposed technique outperforms the other state of the art methods, while
   maintaining a low computational cost. The main contribution of the
   research lies in the fact that only a single slice based small region of
   MRI is used resulting in an outstanding performance. The accuracy,
   sensitivity and specificity achieved are 94\%, 92\% and 96\%
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Granger causality (GC) is one of the most popular measures to
   investigate causality influence among brain regions and has been
   achieved significant results for exploring brain networks based on
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). However, the predictors
   and order selection of conventional GC are based on linear models which
   result in such restrictions as poorly detection of nonlinearity and so
   on, in the application. This paper proposes a novel GC model called back
   propagation (BP) based kernel function Granger causality (BP\_KFGC), in
   which symplectic geometry is used for embedding dimension and fuzzy
   inference system for predicting time series. The proposed method doesn't
   depend on the prediction of the vector auto-regression model, so that
   time series don't need to be wide-sense stationary as linear GC and
   kernel GC. In addition, it is a multivariate approach which is
   applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems and eliminates the
   effects of latent variables. The performance of the new method is
   evaluated and compared with linear GC, partial GC, neural network GC and
   kernel GC by simulated data with multiple adjustments to the
   nonlinearity. The results show that BP\_KFGC outperforms the other four
   methods in detecting both linear and nonlinear causalities. Furthermore,
   we applied BP\_KFGC to construct directed weight network (DWN) of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and health controls (HCs), and then
   nine graph-based features of DWN were used for classification by the
   classifier of support vector machine with radial basis kernel function.
   The accuracy of 95.89\%, sensitivity of 93.31\%, and specificity of
   94.97\% were achieved which may provide an auxiliary mean for the
   clinical diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Early detection is crucial to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon
   as possible. They demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of
   AD in the earliest and hardest to detect stages. The main objective of
   this work is to develop a system that automatically detects the presence
   of the disease in sagittal magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are
   not generally used. Sagittal MRIs from ADNI and OASIS data sets were
   employed. Experiments were conducted using Transfer Learning (TL)
   techniques in order to achieve more accurate results. There are two main
   conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages related to AD
   and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second, the
   results obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the
   state-of-the-art, which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although
   sagittal-plane MRIs are not commonly used, this work proved that they
   were, at least, as effective as MRI from other planes at identifying AD
   in early stages. This could pave the way for further research. Finally,
   one should bear in mind that in certain fields, obtaining the examples
   for a data set can be very expensive. This study proved that DL models
   could be built in these fields, whereas TL is an essential tool for
   completing the task with fewer examples.}},

Abstract = {{We present a Deep Learning framework for the prediction of chronological
   age from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Previous findings
   associate increased brain age with neurodegenerative diseases and higher
   mortality rates. However, the importance of brain age prediction goes
   beyond serving as biomarkers for neurological disorders. Specifically,
   utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis to identify brain
   regions contributing to the prediction can shed light on the complex
   multivariate process of brain aging. Previous work examined methods to
   attribute pixel/voxel-wise contributions to the prediction in a single
   image, resulting in ``explanation maps{''} that were found noisy and
   unreliable. To address this problem, we developed an inference scheme
   for combining these maps across subjects, thus creating a
   population-based, rather than a subject-specific map. We applied this
   method to a CNN ensemble trained on predicting subjects' age from raw T1
   brain images in a lifespan sample of 10,176 subjects. Evaluating the
   model on an untouched test set resulted in mean absolute error of 3.07
   years and a correlation between chronological and predicted age of r =
   0.98. Using the inference method, we revealed that cavities containing
   cerebrospinal fluid, previously found as general atrophy markers, had
   the highest contribution for age prediction. Comparing maps derived from
   different models within the ensemble allowed to assess differences and
   similarities in brain regions utilized by the model. We showed that this
   method substantially increased the replicability of explanation maps,
   converged with results from voxel-based morphometry age studies and
   highlighted brain regions whose volumetric variability correlated the
   most with the prediction error.}},

Abstract = {{Motivation: The multimodal data fusion analysis becomes another
   important field for brain disease detection and increasing researches
   concentrate on using neural network algorithms to solve a range of
   problems. However, most current neural network optimizing strategies
   focus on internal nodes or hidden layer numbers, while ignoring the
   advantages of external optimization. Additionally, in the multimodal
   data fusion analysis of brain science, the problems of small sample size
   and high-dimensional data are often encountered due to the difficulty of
   data collection and the specialization of brain science data, which may
   result in the lower generalization performance of neural network.
   Results: We propose a genetically evolved random neural network cluster
   (GERNNC) model. Specifically, the fusion characteristics are first
   constructed to be taken as the input and the best type of neural network
   is selected as the base classifier to form the initial random neural
   network cluster. Second, the cluster is adaptively genetically evolved.
   Based on the GERNNC model, we further construct a multi-tasking
   framework for the classification of patients with brain disease and the
   extraction of significant characteristics. In a study of genetic data
   and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's

Abstract = {{Objective To examine the feasibility of using cross-sectional PET to
   identify cognitive decliners among beta-amyloid (A beta)-negative
   cognitively normal (CN) elderly adults. Methods We determined the
   highest A beta-affected region by ranking baseline and accumulation
   rates of florbetapir-PET regions in 355 CN elderly adults using
   F-18-florbetapir-PET from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS)
   were found as the highest A beta-affected region, and A beta positivity
   in this region was defined as above the lowest boundary of BANKSSTS
   standardized uptake value ratio of A beta+ (ADNI-defined COMPOSITE
   region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows:
   stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2,
   BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated
   subsequent longitudinal cognitive change, and F-18-flortaucipir
   (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 +/- 1.6 years later to track tau deposition.
   Results LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and
   stage 2 (n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster

   Conclusions Nominally A beta- CN individuals with high A beta in
   BANKSSTS are at increased risk of cognitive decline, probably showing an
   earlier stage of A beta deposition. Our findings may help elucidate the
   association between brain A beta accumulation and cognition in A beta-

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been studied as a potential
   diagnostic method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological
   progression of AD leads to cortical disconnection. These disconnections
   may manifest as functional connectivity alterations, measured by the
   degree of synchronization between different brain regions, and
   alterations in complex behaviors produced by the interaction among
   wide-spread brain regions. Recently, machine learning methods, such as
   clustering algorithms and classification methods, have been adopted to
   detect disease-related changes in functional connectivity and classify
   the features of these changes. Although complexity of EEG signals can
   also reflect AD-related changes, few machine learning studies have
   focused on the changes in complexity. Therefore, in this study, we
   compared the ability of EEG signals to detect characteristics of AD
   using different machine learning approaches one focused on functional
   connectivity and the other focused on signal complexity. We examined
   functional connectivity, estimated by phase lag index (PLI) in EEG
   signals in healthy older participants {[}healthy control (HC)] and
   patients with AD. We estimated signal complexity using multi-scale
   entropy. Utilizing a support vector machine, we compared the
   identification accuracy of AD based on functional connectivity at each
   frequency band and complexity component. Additionally, we evaluated the
   relationship between synchronization and complexity. The identification
   accuracy of functional connectivity of the alpha, beta, and gamma bands
   was significantly high (AUC 1.0), and the identification accuracy of
   complexity was sufficiently high (AUC 0.81). Moreover, the relationship
   between functional connectivity and complexity exhibited various
   temporal-scale-and-regional-specific dependency in both HC participants
   and patients with AD. In conclusion, the combination of functional
   connectivity and complexity might reflect complex pathological process
   of AD. Applying a combination of both machine learning methods to
   neurophysiological data may provide a novel understanding of the neural
   network processes in both healthy brains and pathological conditions.}},

   paper, we propose a hierarchical fully convolutional network (H-FCN) to

Abstract = {{The hub-and-spoke semantic representation theory posits that semantic
   knowledge is processed in a neural network, which contains an amodal
   hub, the sensorimotor modality-specific regions, and the connections
   between them. The exact neural basis of the hub, regions and
   connectivity remains unclear. Semantic dementia could be an ideal lesion
   model to construct the semantic network as this disease presents both
   amodal and modality-specific semantic processing (e.g. colour) deficits.
   The goal of the present study was to identify, using an unbiased
   data-driven approach, the semantic hub and its general and
   modality-specific semantic white matter connections by investigating the
   relationship between the lesion degree of the network and the severity
   of semantic deficits in 33 patients with semantic dementia. Data of
   diffusion-weighted imaging and behavioural performance in processing
   knowledge of general semantic and six sensorimotor modalities (i.e.
   object form, colour, motion, sound, manipulation and function) were
   collected from each subject. Specifically, to identify the semantic hub,
   we mapped the white matter nodal degree value (a graph theoretical
   index) of the 90 regions in the automated anatomical labelling atlas
   with the general semantic abilities of the patients. Of the regions,
   only the left fusiform gyrus was identified as the hub because its
   structural connectivity strength (i.e. nodal degree value) could
   significantly predict the general semantic processing of the patients.
   To identify the general and modalityspecific semantic connections of the
   semantic hub, we separately correlated the white matter integrity values
   of each tract connected with the left fusiform gyrus, with the
   performance for general semantic processing and each of six semantic
   modality processing. The results showed that the hub region worked in
   concert with nine other regions in the semantic memory network for
   general semantic processing. Moreover, the connection between the hub
   and the left calcarine was associated with colour-specific semantic
   processing. The observed effects could not be accounted for by potential
   confounding variables (e.g. total grey matter volume, regional grey
   matter volume and performance on non-semantic control tasks). Our
   findings refine the neuroanatomical structure of the semantic network
   and underline the critical role of the left fusiform gyrus and its
   connectivity in the network.}},

   images, and in particular, not enough cases where quantitative
   evaluation was used to determine whether the generated images had enough
   realism and diversity to be used for DA. In this study, we synthesized
   18F-Florbetaben (FBB) images using CGAN. The generated images were
   evaluated using various measures, and we presented the state of the
   images and the similarity value of quantitative measurement that can be
   expected to successfully augment data from generated images for DA. The
   method includes (1) conditional WGAN-GP to learn the axial image
   distribution extracted from pre-processed 3D FBB images, (2) pre-trained
   DenseNet121 and model-agnostic metrics for visual and quantitative
   measurements of generated image distribution, and (3) a machine learning
   model for observing improvement in generalization performance by
   generated dataset. The Visual Turing test showed similarity in the
   descriptions of typical patterns of amyloid deposition for each of the
   generated images. However, differences in similarity and classification
   performance per axial level were observed, which did not agree with the
   visual evaluation. Experimental results demonstrated that quantitative
   measurements were able to detect the similarity between two
   distributions and observe mode collapse better than the Visual Turing
   test and t-SNE.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of review With the advancement of computational approaches and
   abundance of biomedical data, a broad range of neurodegenerative disease
   models have been developed. In this review, we argue that computational
   models can be both relevant and useful in neurodegenerative disease
   research and although the current established models have limitations in
   clinical practice, artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome
   deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can improve our
   understanding of disease. Recent findings In recent years, diverse
   computational approaches have been used to shed light on different
   aspects of neurodegenerative disease models. For example, linear and
   nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling regression, differential equation
   models, and event-based models have been applied to provide a better
   understanding of disease progression patterns and biomarker
   trajectories. Additionally, the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian
   network models, and deep-learning-based approaches have been used to
   predict the probability of future incidence of disease, whereas
   nonnegative matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis,
   hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based
   approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their
   disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of neurodegenerative
   disease data is possible through knowledge-based models which use prior
   knowledge to complement data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based
   models can include pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways
   perturbed in a given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge
   maps, which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease.
   Collectively, these established models have revealed high granular
   details and insights into neurodegenerative disease models. In
   conjunction with increasingly advanced computational approaches, a wide
   spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models, which can be broadly
   categorized into data-driven and knowledge-driven, have been developed.
   We review the state of the art data and knowledge-driven models and
   discuss the necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical
   application.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is one of the leading causes of death in
   developed countries. From a research point of view, impressive results
   have been reported using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no
   practical diagnostic method is available. In recent years, deep models
   have become popular, especially in dealing with images. Since 2013, deep
   learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection
   research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing
   drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more
   accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning
   techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for
   classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature
   representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews
   the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a
   systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most
   recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers
   and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the
   necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with
   neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality
   studies. Deep models and their performance are described in detail.
   Although deep learning has achieved notable performance in detecting AD,

Abstract = {{Recently, combining feature extraction and classification method of
   electroencephalogram (EEG) signals has been widely used in identifying
   mild cognitive impairment. However, it remains unclear which feature of
   EEG signals is best effective in assessing amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment (aMCI) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when combining
   one classifier. This study proposed a novel feature extraction method of
   EEG signals named feature-fusion multispectral image method (FMIM) for
   diagnosis of aMCI with T2DM. The FMIM was integrated with convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to classify the processed multispectral image data.
   The results showed that FMIM could effectively identify aMCI with T2DM
   from the control group compared to existing multispectral image method
   (MIM), with improvements including the type and quantity of feature
   extraction. Meanwhile, part of the invalid calculation could be avoided
   during the classification process. In addition, the classification
   evaluation indexes were best under the combination of Alpha2-Beta1-Beta2
   frequency bands in data set based on FMIM-1, and were also best under
   the combination of the Theta-Alphal-Alpha2-Beta1-Beta2 frequency bands
   in data set based on FMIM-2. Therefore, FMIM can be used as an effective
   feature extraction method of aMCI with T2DM, and as a valuable biomarker

Abstract = {{Machine learning algorithms are currently being implemented in an
   escalating manner to classify and/or predict the onset of some
   neurodegenerative diseases; including Alzheimer's Disease (AD); this
   could be attributed to the fact of the abundance of data and powerful
   computers. The objective of this work was to deliver a robust
   classification system for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) against
   healthy controls (HC) in a low-cost network in terms of shallow
   architecture and processing. In this study, the dataset included was
   downloaded from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI).
   The classification methodology implemented was the convolutional neural
   network (CNN), where the diffusion maps, and gray-matter (GM) volumes
   were the input images. The number of scans included was 185, 106, and
   115 for HC, MCI and AD respectively. Ten-fold cross-validation scheme
   was adopted and the stacked mean diffusivity (MD) and GM volume produced
   an AUC of 0.94 and 0.84, an accuracy of 93.5\% and 79.6\%, a sensitivity
   of 92.5\% and 62.7\%, and a specificity of 93.9\% and 89\% for AD/HC and
   MCI/HC classification respectively. This work elucidates the impact of
   incorporating data from different imaging modalities; i.e. structural
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI),
   where deep learning was employed for the aim of classification. To the
   best of our knowledge, this is the first study assessing the impact of
   having more than one scan per subject and propose the proper maneuver to
   confirm the robustness of the system. The results were competitive among
   the existing literature, which paves the way for improving medications
   that could slow down the progress of the AD or prevent it.}},

Abstract = {{Elevated brain activation, or hyperexcitability, induces cognitive
   impairment and confers an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Blocking the overexcitation of the neural network may be a promising new
   strategy to prevent, halt, and even reverse this condition. Physical
   exercise has been shown to be an effective cognitive enhancer that
   reduces the risk of AD in elderly individuals, but the underlying
   mechanisms are far from being fully understood. We explored whether
   long-term treadmill exercise attenuates amyloid precursor protein
   (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation-induced aberrant network activity and
   thus improves cognition by altering the numbers and/or distribution of
   voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) in transgenic mice. APP/PS1 mice
   aged 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, and 9 months underwent treadmill exercise with
   different durations or at different stages of AD. The alterations in
   memory, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and expression levels and
   distributions of Nav functional members (Nav1.1 alpha, Nav1.2, Nav1.6,
   and Nav beta 2) were evaluated. The results revealed that treadmill
   exercise with 12- and 24-week durations 1) induced significant
   improvement in novel object recognition (NOR) memory and Morris water
   maze (MWM) spatial memory; 2) partially reduced abnormal spike activity;
   and 3) redressed the disturbed cellular distribution of Nav1.1 alpha,
   aberrant Nav beta 2 cleavage augmentation, and Nav1.6 upregulation.
   Additionally, APP/PS1 mice in the 24-week exercise group showed better
   performance in the NOR task and a large decrease in Nav1.6 expression,
   which was close to the wild-type level. This study suggests that
   exercise improves cognition and neural activity by altering the numbers
   and distribution of hippocampal Nav in APP/PS1 mice. Long-term treadmill
   exercise, for about 24 weeks, starting in the preclinical stage, is a
   promising therapeutic strategy for preventing AD and halting its
   progress.}},

Abstract = {{Objective The current study was conducted to improve the understanding
   of relationships between regional cortical amyloid load, glucose
   metabolism, cortical morphology (volume), and severity of clinical
   symptoms in patients with AD, MCI, and age-matched controls. Methods To
   objectivize the radiological evaluation of patients with suspected AD,
   head-to-head multi-modality imaging studies were conducted using MRI and
   PET/CT with {[}F-18]FDG and {[}F-18]AV45 for visualization and
   quantitation of brain morphology, glucose metabolism, and amyloid
   levels, respectively. A total of 84 subjects was studied, including 33
   patients with AD, 31 patients with MCI, and 20 age-matched healthy
   controls (HC). A new quantitative index was calculated as a ratio of
   regional SUV of {[}F-18]AV45 (normalized to cerebellar cortex) over the
   corresponding regional SUV of {[}F-18]FDG, divided by the corresponding
   regional volume, measured from the co-registered MRI and normalized to
   the normal age-matched control group (AV45/FDG/NVol index).
   Relationships between clinical scores (TMSE, ADAS) and AV45/FDG/NVol
   indices for different structures of the brain in study groups were
   determined using linear regression analyses. Results A significant
   direct linear correlation was observed between the AV45/FDG/NVol index
   and ADAS-Cog test score and an inverse correlation with TMSE score at
   baseline and with the degree of changes in ADAS and TMSE scores assessed
   one year later (disease progression). The observed correlations between
   AV45/FDG/NVol index and clinical scores were higher than those with
   MRI-based cortical volumes, FDG SUV, or cerebellum-normalized AV45 SUV
   alone. Conclusions Current study demonstrated that AV45/FDG/NVol index
   mapping of the brain is a novel quantitative molecular imaging biomarker
   that correlates with clinical neurocognitive status and may facilitate
   more accurate diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of AD. Additional larger
   scale clinical studies are required to further evaluate the efficacy of
   this new quantitative index as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of
   AD as well as for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of novel agents
   undergoing clinical trials for therapy of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Brain-predicted age difference scores are calculated by subtracting
   chronological age from `brain' age, which is estimated using
   neuroimaging data. Positive scores reflect accelerated ageing and are
   associated with increased mortality risk and poorer physical function.
   To date, however, the relationship between brain-predicted age
   difference scores and specific cognitive functions has not been
   systematically examined using appropriate statistical methods. First,
   applying machine learning to 1359 T1-weighted MRI scans, we predicted
   the relationship between chronological age and voxel-wise grey matter
   data. This model was then applied to MRI data from three independent
   datasets, significantly predicting chronological age in each dataset:
   Dokuz Eylul University (n = 175), the Cognitive Reserve/Reference
   Ability Neural Network study (n = 380), and The Irish Longitudinal Study
   on Ageing (n = 487). Each independent dataset had rich
   neuropsychological data. Brain-predicted age difference scores were
   significantly negatively correlated with performance on measures of
   general cognitive status (two datasets); processing speed, visual
   attention, and cognitive flexibility (three datasets); visual attention
   and cognitive flexibility (two datasets); and semantic verbal fluency
   (two datasets). As such, there is firm evidence of correlations between
   increased brain-predicted age differences and reduced cognitive function

Abstract = {{Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has
   always been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist
   default brain variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence,
   the states of the latent variables that relate to emotional processing
   must contribute to building robust recognition models. Specifically, we
   propose to utilize an unsupervised deep generative model (e.g.,
   variational autoencoder) to determine the latent factors from the
   multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the
   emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The
   performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public
   datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix
   factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental
   results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable
   for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition
   framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is
   the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel
   EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach proposed in
   this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also promising
   in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive
   impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or
   aberrant compared with the normal healthy control.}},

Abstract = {{White matter lesions (WML) are common in a variety of brain pathologies,
   including ischemia affecting blood vessels deeper inside the brain's
   white matter, and show an abnormal signal in T1-weighted and FLAIR
   images. The emergence of personalized medicine requires quantification
   and analysis of differential characteristics of WML across different
   brain regions. Manual segmentation and analysis of WMLs is laborious and
   time-consuming; therefore, automated methods providing robust,
   reproducible, and fast WML segmentation and analysis are highly
   desirable. In this study, we tackled the segmentation problem as a
   voxel-based classification problem. We developed an ensemble of
   different classification models, including six models of support vector
   machine, trained on handcrafted and transfer learning features, and five
   models of Residual neural network, trained on varying window sizes. The
   output of these models was combined through majority-voting. A series of
   image processing operations was applied to remove false positives in a
   post-processing step. Moreover, images were mapped to a standard atlas
   template to quantify the spatial distribution of WMLs, and a radiomic
   analysis of all the lesions across different brain regions was carried
   out. The performance of the method on multi-institutional WML
   Segmentation Challenge dataset (n = 150) comprising T1-weighted and
   FLAIR images was >90\% within data of each institution,
   multi-institutional data pooled together, and across-institution
   training-testing. Forty-five percent of lesions were found in the
   temporal lobe of the brain, and these lesions were easier to segment
   (95.67\%) compared to lesions in other brain regions. Lesions in
   different brain regions were characterized by their differential
   characteristics of signal strength, size/shape, heterogeneity, and
   texture (p < 0.001). The proposed multimodal ensemble-based segmentation
   of WML showed effective performance across all scanners. Further, the
   radiomic characteristics of WMLs of different brain regions provide an
   in vivo portrait of phenotypic heterogeneity in WMLs, which points to
   the need for precision diagnostics and personalized treatment.}},

Year = {{2020}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Featured Application Skull stripping is the most prevalent brain image
   analysis method. This method can be applied to areas such as brain
   tissue segmentation and volumetric measurement, longitudinal analysis,
   multiple sclerosis analysis, cortical and sub-cortical analysis,
   assessing schizophrenia, and for the planning of neurosurgical
   interventions.
   Abstract Skull stripping in brain magnetic resonance volume has recently
   been attracting attention due to an increased demand to develop an
   efficient, accurate, and general algorithm for diverse datasets of the
   brain. Accurate skull stripping is a critical step for neuroimaging
   diagnostic systems because neither the inclusion of non-brain tissues
   nor removal of brain parts can be corrected in subsequent steps, which
   results in unfixed error through subsequent analysis. The objective of
   this review article is to give a comprehensive overview of skull
   stripping approaches, including recent deep learning-based approaches.
   In this paper, the current methods of skull stripping have been divided
   into two distinct groups-conventional or classical approaches, and
   convolutional neural networks or deep learning approaches. The
   potentials of several methods are emphasized because they can be applied
   to standard clinical imaging protocols. Finally, current trends and
   future developments are addressed giving special attention to recent
   deep learning algorithms.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early stage of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Automatic diagnosis of MCI by magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) images has been the focus of research in recent years.
   Furthermore, deep learning models based on 2D view and 3D view have been
   widely used in the diagnosis of MCI. The deep learning architecture can
   capture anatomical changes in the brain from MRI scans to extract the
   underlying features of brain disease. In this paper, we propose a
   multi-view based multi-model (MVMM) learning framework, which
   effectively combines the local information of 2D images with the global
   information of 3D images. First, we select some 2D slices from MRI
   images and extract the features representing 2D local information. Then,
   we combine them with the features representing 3D global information
   learned from 3D images to train the MVMM learning framework. We evaluate
   our model on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. The experimental results show that our proposed model can

   hippocampus segmentation and classification in Alzheimer's disease}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{208}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain
   degenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical
   precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no
   effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of
   AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease
   progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in
   AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are
   often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
   However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from
   segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is
   independent of the classification model, which could result in
   sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep
   learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint
   automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using
   structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed
   for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease
   classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional
   Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted
   based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification
   task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet
   models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated
   on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD,
   233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a
   dice similarity coefficient of 87.0\% for hippocampal segmentation. In
   addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9\% and an AUC
   (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5\% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects,
   and an accuracy of 76.2\% and an AUC of 77.5\% for classifying MCI vs.
   NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed
   multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several
   other competing methods.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of
   the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and
   in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and BrainComputer Interface
   (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a
   nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the
   underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel
   multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to
   integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain
   states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to
   discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically,
   in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG
   signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of
   the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features
   (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1),
   alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear
   phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS)
   are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a
   second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also
   evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed
   into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs.
   MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an
   experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63
   MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the
   concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS)
   features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier
   outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE),
   Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently,
   our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable
   alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning
   approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deep kernel learning has been well explored for multi-class
   classification tasks; however, relatively less work is done for
   one-class classification (OCC). OCC needs samples from only one class to
   train the model. Most recently, kernel regularized least squares (KRL)
   method-based deep architecture is developed for the OCC task. This paper
   introduces a novel extension of this method by embedding minimum
   variance information within this architecture. This embedding improves
   the generalization capability of the classifier by reducing the
   intra-class variance. In contrast to traditional deep learning methods,
   this method can effectively work with small-size datasets. We conduct a
   comprehensive set of experiments on 18 benchmark datasets (13 biomedical
   and 5 other datasets) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed
   classifier. We compare the results with 16 state-of-the-art one-class
   classifiers. Further, we also test our method for 2 real-world
   biomedical datasets viz.; detection of Alzheimer's disease from
   structural magnetic resonance imaging data and detection of breast
   cancer from histopathological images. Proposed method exhibits more than
   5\% F-1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for various

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease.
   Right now there is no cure for AD. As we know, the brain structure is

   diagnosis of AD. We use the deep learning method DeepWalk to extract the
   structural features of each subject based on brain function connection.
   The method takes a brain topology network based on functional connection
   transformations as input and outputs a potential feature representation
   for each brain region in the brain network structure. In the current
   research, a new potential biomarker is found, which is based on a
   structural feature that can represent changes in brain connectivity. In
   our experiment, 79 Resting-state fMRI were used from ADNI dataset,
   including 49 normal controls (NCs) and 30 AD patients. By analyzing the
   structural features between AD patients and NCs, obvious differences are
   detected in the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe. We use a
   support vector machine (SVM) model to evaluate the performance of these
   structural features, and its classification performance achieves 80.36\%

Abstract = {{The deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) approaches of
   dementia often require a lot of manual intervention. Although deep
   learning has a good effect on feature extraction, the current deep
   learning methods usually need to set a large number of parameters

   (H-ELM) needs only less manual intervention and can extract features by
   a multi-layer feature representation framework, which is much faster
   than the traditional deep learning methods. A CADx framework based on
   H-ELM, named DCADx, is proposed. As common spatial pattern (CSP) and
   brain functional network (BFN) have been proven to have better
   de-redundancy effects on brain data, the DCADx contains two different
   data redundancy reduction methods: (1) CSP-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-CSP
   model) and (2) BFN-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-BFN model). The experimental

   the feature expression ability of H-ELM to achieve better performance.
   CSP and BFN can reduce the redundancy to enhance the diagnostic accuracy

Volume = {{14}},

Abstract = {{This paper examines the problem of diffeomorphic image registration in
   the presence of differing image intensity profiles and sparsely sampled,
   missing, or damaged tissue. Our motivation comes from the problem of
   aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology
   sections at 1 x 1 x 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying
   stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation,
   exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images
   are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this
   injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and
   target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating
   polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is
   accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several
   atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to
   ``background{''} or ``artifact.{''} The two concepts are combined within
   an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors
   and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial
   coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with
   simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard
   benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital
   pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard
   convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices,
   this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density
   distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an
   Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate beta-amyloid and tau depositions using
   Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and
   AV1451 tau PET imaging in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
   Methods Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age,
   sex, and APOE epsilon 4 status from the population-based Mayo Clinic
   Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these
   individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent
   AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios
   (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer
   disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated
   for group comparisons and testing for associations with age.
   Results AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio {[}OR] {[}95\% confidence
   interval (CI)] = 0.52 {[}0.27-0.98], p = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr
   (OR {[}95\% CI] = 0.52 {[}0.28-0.99], p = 0.048), and the frequency of
   abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR {[}95\% CI] = 0.10 {[}0.01-0.90], p = 0.040) were
   lower in MS than controls. Although AD-signature and total cortical
   AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of
   abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR {[}95\% CI] = 10.65
   {[}1.10-103.35], p = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD
   signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to
   patients with MS (estimate {[}95\% CI] = -0.14 {[}-0.023 to -0.006], p =
   0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age
   was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate
   {[}95\% CI] = -0.13 {[}-0.021 to -0.005], p = 0.002). There was no
   difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between
   the MS patients and controls.
   Interpretation Although both beta-amyloid and tau are biomarkers of
   cognitive aging and AD, cortical beta-amyloid deposition was lower in MS
   than age-matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS
   pathobiology retards the accumulation of beta-amyloid but not the
   accumulation of tau. ANN NEUROL 2020}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common progressive
   neurodegenerative diseases. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
   would provide abundant information on the anatomical structure of human
   organs. Fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) obtains
   the metabolic activity of the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated
   that multi-modality images could contribute to improve diagnosis of AD.
   However, these methods need to extract the handcrafted features that
   demand domain specific knowledge and image processing stage is time
   consuming. In order to tackle these problems, in this study, the authors
   propose a novel framework that ensembles three state-of-the-art deep
   convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with multi-modality images for AD
   classification. In detail, they extract some slices from each subject of
   each modality, and every DCNN generates a probabilistic score for the
   input slices. Furthermore, a `dropout' mechanism is introduced to
   discard low discrimination slices of the category probabilities. Then
   average reserved slices of each subject are acquired as a new feature.
   Finally, they train the Adaboost ensemble classifier based on single
   decision tree classifier with the MRI and PET probabilistic scores of
   each DCNN. Evaluations on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative

   compared to existing method, the algorithm proposed in this study
   significantly improved the classification accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive cerebral disease

   disease has been largely attributed to accumulation of amyloid beta (A
   beta), but a complete cure has remained elusive. F-18-Florbetaben
   amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) has been shown as a more
   powerful tool for understanding AD-related brain changes than magnetic
   resonance imaging and computed tomography. In this paper, we propose an
   accurate classification method for scoring brain amyloid plaque load
   (BAPL) based on deep convolutional neural networks. A joint
   discriminative loss function was formulated by adding a discriminative
   intra-loss function to the conventional (cross-entropy) loss function.
   The performance of the proposed joint loss function was compared with
   that of the conventional loss function in three state-of-the-art deep
   neural network architectures. The intra-loss function significantly
   improved the BAPL classification performance. In addition, we showed
   that the mix-up data augmentation method, originally proposed for

Abstract = {{While convolutional neural network (CNN) has been demonstrating powerful
   ability to learn hierarchical spatial features from medical images, it
   is still difficult to apply it directly to resting-state functional MRI
   (rs-fMRI) and the derived brain functional networks (BFNs). We propose a
   novel CNN framework to simultaneously learn embedded features from BFNs
   for brain disease diagnosis. Since BFNs can be built by considering both
   static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC), we first decompose
   rs-fMRI into multiple static BFNs with modified independent component
   analysis. Then, the voxel-wise variability in dynamic FC is used to
   quantify BFN dynamics. A set of paired 3D images representing
   static/dynamic BFNs can be fed into 3D CNNs, from which we can
   hierarchically and simultaneously learn static/dynamic BFN features. As
   a result, the dynamic BFN features can complement static BFN features
   and, at the meantime, different BFNs can help each other toward a joint
   and better classification. We validate our method with a publicly
   accessible, large cohort of rs-fMRI dataset in early-stage mild
   cognitive impairment (eMCI) diagnosis, which is one of the most
   challenging problems to the clinicians. By comparing with a conventional
   method, our method shows significant diagnostic performance improvement
   by almost. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning
   in preclinical Alzheimers disease diagnosis, based on the complex and
   high-dimensional voxel-wise spatiotemporal patterns of the resting-state
   brain functional connectomics. The framework provides a new but
   intuitive way to fully exploit deeply embedded diagnostic features from
   rs-fMRI for a better-individualized diagnosis of various neurological

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) may cause damage to the memory cells
   permanently, which results in the form of dementia. The diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's disease at an early stage is a problematic task for
   researchers. For this, machine learning and deep convolutional neural
   network (CNN) based approaches are readily available to solve various
   problems related to brain image data analysis. In clinical research,
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose AD. For accurate

   features obtained from MRI images. Recently advanced deep CNN-based
   models successfully proved their accuracy. However, due to a smaller
   number of image samples available in the datasets, there exist problems
   of over-fitting hindering the performance of deep learning approaches.
   In this research, we developed a Siamese convolutional neural network
   (SCNN) model inspired by VGG-16 (also called Oxford Net) to classify
   dementia stages. In our approach, we extend the insufficient and
   imbalanced data by using augmentation approaches. Experiments are
   performed on a publicly available dataset open access series of imaging
   studies (OASIS), by using the proposed approach, an excellent test

Abstract = {{Purpose Although most deep learning (DL) studies have reported excellent
   classification accuracy, these studies usually target typical
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) and normal cognition (NC) for which
   conventional visual assessment performs well. A clinically relevant
   issue is the selection of high-risk subjects who need active
   surveillance among equivocal cases. We validated the clinical
   feasibility of DL compared with visual rating or quantitative
   measurement for assessing the diagnosis and prognosis of subjects with
   equivocal amyloid scans. Methods F-18-florbetaben scans of 430 cases (85
   NC, 233 mild cognitive impairment, and 112 AD) were assessed through
   visual rating-based, quantification-based, and DL-based methods. DL was
   trained using 280 two-dimensional PET images (80\%) and tested by
   randomly assigning the remaining (70 cases, 20\%) cases and a clinical
   validation set of 54 equivocal cases. In the equivocal cases, we
   assessed the agreement among the visual rating, quantification, and DL
   and compared the clinical outcome according to each modality-based
   amyloid status. Results The visual reading was positive in 175 cases,
   equivocal in 54 cases, and negative in 201 cases. The composite SUVR
   cutoff value was 1.32 (AUC 0.99). The subject-level performance of DL
   using the test set was 100\%. Among the 54 equivocal cases, 37 cases
   were classified as positive (Eq(deep+)) by DL, 40 cases were classified
   by a second-round visual assessment, and 40 cases were classified by
   quantification. The DL- and quantification-based classifications showed
   good agreement (83\%, kappa = 0.59). The composite SUVRs differed
   between Eq(deep+) (1.47 {[}0.13]) and Eq(deep-) (1.29 {[}0.10]; P <
   0.001). DL, but not the visual rating, showed a significant difference
   in the Mini-Mental Status Examination score change during the follow-up
   between Eq(deep+) (- 4.21 {[}0.57]) and Eq(deep-) (- 1.74 {[}0.76]; P =
   0.023) (mean duration, 1.76 years). Conclusions In visually equivocal
   scans, DL was more related to quantification than to visual assessment,
   and the negative cases selected by DL showed no decline in cognitive
   outcome. DL is useful for clinical diagnosis and prognosis assessment in
   subjects with visually equivocal amyloid scans.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose Although functional brain imaging has been used for the early
   and objective assessment of cognitive dysfunction, there is a lack of
   generalized image-based biomarker which can evaluate individual's
   cognitive dysfunction in various disorders. To this end, we developed a
   deep learning-based cognitive signature of FDG brain PET adaptable for
   Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods A
   deep learning model for discriminating AD from normal controls (NCs) was
   built by a training set consisting of 636 FDG PET obtained from
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The model was
   directly transferred to images of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   patients (n = 666) for identifying who would rapidly convert to AD and
   another independent cohort consisting of 62 PD patients to differentiate
   PD patients with dementia. The model accuracy was measured by area under
   curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The
   relationship between all images was visualized by two-dimensional
   projection of the deep learning-based features. The model was also
   designed to predict cognitive score of the subjects and validated in PD
   patients. Cognitive dysfunction-related regions were visualized by
   feature maps of the deep CNN model. Results AUC of ROC for
   differentiating AD from NC was 0.94 (95\% CI 0.89-0.98). The transfer of
   the model could differentiate MCI patients who would convert to AD (AUC
   = 0.82) and PD with dementia (AUC = 0.81). The two-dimensional
   projection mapping visualized the degree of cognitive dysfunction
   compared with normal brains regardless of different disease cohorts.
   Predicted cognitive score, an output of the model, was highly correlated
   with the mini-mental status exam scores. Individual cognitive
   dysfunction-related regions included cingulate and high frontoparietal
   cortices, while they showed individual variability. Conclusion The deep
   learning-based cognitive function evaluation model could be successfully
   transferred to multiple disease domains. We suggest that this approach
   might be extended to an objective cognitive signature that provides
   quantitative biomarker for cognitive dysfunction across various

Abstract = {{In order to predict the risks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on the

   a total of 350 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the

   Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (CAFFE) was selected as the
   framework of the deep learning platform; the FDG PET image features of
   each participant were extracted by a deep convolution network model to
   construct the prediction and classification models; therefore, the MCI
   stage features were classified and the transformation was predicted. The
   results showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction, the
   sensitivity and specificity of conv3 classification were respectively
   91.02\% and 77.63\%; in terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment
   (LMCI) and Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) classification, the
   accuracy of conv5 classification was 72.19\%, and the sensitivity and

   effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of
   AD based on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in

Abstract = {{Neuroanatomical segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the
   brain is a prerequisite for quantitative volume, thickness, and shape
   measurements, as well as an important intermediate step in many
   preprocessing pipelines. This work introduces a new highly accurate and
   versatile method based on 3D convolutional neural networks for the
   automatic segmentation of neuroanatomy in T1-weighted MRI. In
   combination with a deep 3D fully convolutional architecture, efficient
   linear registration-derived spatial priors are used to incorporate
   additional spatial context into the network. An aggressive data
   augmentation scheme using random elastic deformations is also used to
   regularize the networks, allowing for excellent performance even in
   cases where only limited labeled training data are available. Applied to
   hippocampus segmentation in an elderly population (mean Dice coefficient
   = 92.1\%) and subcortical segmentation in a healthy adult population
   (mean Dice coefficient = 89.5\%), we demonstrate new state-of-the-art
   accuracies and a high robustness to outliers. Further validation on a
   multistructure segmentation task in a scan-rescan dataset demonstrates
   accuracy (mean Dice coefficient = 86.6\%) similar to the scan-rescan
   reliability of expert manual segmentations (mean Dice coefficient =
   86.9\%), and improved reliability compared to both expert manual
   segmentations and automated segmentations using FIRST. Furthermore, our
   method maintains a highly competitive runtime performance (e.g.,
   requiring only 10 s for left/right hippocampal segmentation in 1 x1
   x1mm(3) MNI stereotaxic space), orders of magnitude faster than
   conventional multiatlas segmentation methods.}},

Journal = {{EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{140}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: The molecular mechanism of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has not
   been clearly revealed and there is no clinically reliable genetic risk
   factor. Therefore, diagnosis of AD has been mostly performed by
   analyzing brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging and
   neuropsychological tests. Identifying the molecular-level mechanism of
   AD has been lacking data owing to the difficulty of sampling in the
   posterior brains of normal and AD patients; however, recent studies have
   produced and analyzed large-scale omics data for brain areas such as
   prefrontal cortex. Therefore, it is necessary to develop AD diagnosis or
   prediction methods based on these data.
   Results: This paper proposed a deep learning-based model that can
   predict AD using large-scale gene expression and DNA methylation data.
   The most challenging problem in constructing a model to diagnose AD
   based on the multi-omics dataset is how to integrate different omics
   data and how to deal with high-dimensional and low-sample-size data. To
   solve this problem, we proposed a novel but simple approach to reduce
   the number of features based on a differentially expressed gene and a
   differentially methylated position in the multi-omics dataset. Moreover,
   we developed a deep neural network-based prediction model that improves
   performance compared to that of conventional machine learning
   algorithms. The feature selection method and the prediction model
   presented in this paper outperformed conventional machine learning
   algorithms, which utilize typical dimension reduction methods. In
   addition, we demonstrated that integrating gene expression and DNA
   methylation data could improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2019

Abstract = {{Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain
   magnetic resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research,
   since its structural integrity is strongly related to several
   neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some
   automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent
   years, new deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven to be much
   more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work,
   we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds
   statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the
   deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is
   achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net-based segmentation, (2) a
   shape model estimation, and (3) a second U-Net-based segmentation which
   uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The
   trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic
   groups {[}AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   controls] from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort
   validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with
   the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types
   of context information (i.e., autocontext and tissue-class context). Our
   results suggest that adding shape information can improve the
   segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e., when DNNs are
   trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant
   benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e., training and
   testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other
   types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be
   the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the
   computational time in the order of a few minutes.}},

Title = {{Test-retest reliability of spatial patterns from resting-state

Abstract = {{Background: Restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), including greedy
   layer-wise trained RBMs as part of a deep belief network (DBN), have the
   ability to identify spatial patterns (SPs; functional networks) in
   resting-state fMRI (rfMRI) data. However, there has been little research
   on (1) the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of SPs derived
   from RBMs and on (2) hierarchical SPs derived from DBNs.
   Methods: We applied a weight sparsity-controlled RBM and DBN to
   whole-brain rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. We evaluated
   the within-session reproducibility and between-session test-retest
   reliability of the SPs derived from the RBM approach and compared them
   both with those identified using independent component analysis (ICA)
   and with three voxel-wise statistical measures-the Hurst exponent,
   entropy, and kurtosis-of the rfMRI data. We also assessed the potential
   hierarchy of the SPs from the DBN.
   Results: An increase in the sparsity level of the RBM weights enhanced
   the reproducibility of the SPs. The SPs deriving from a stringent weight
   sparsity level were predominantly found in the cortical gray matter and
   substantially overlapped with the SPs obtained from the Hurst exponent.
   A hierarchical representation was shown by constructed using the
   default-mode network obtained from the DBN.
   Comparison with existing methods: The test-retest reliability of the SPs
   from the RBM was superior to that of the SPs from the voxel-wise
   statistics.
   Conclusions: The SPs from the RBM were reproducible within sessions and
   reliable across sessions. The hierarchically organized SPs from the DBN
   could possibly be applied to research based on rfMRI data.}},

Title = {{Pentylenetetrazole-induced Seizure Susceptibility in the Tau58/4
   Transgenic Mouse Model of Tauopathy}},
Journal = {{NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{425}},
Pages = {{112-122}},
Month = {{JAN 15}},
Abstract = {{In several tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), an increased
   incidence of seizures is observed. Tau, one of the major proteins
   implicated in AD pathology, is an important regulator of neural network
   excitability and might participate in the underlying epileptic cascade.
   However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully
   elucidated. We aim to investigate this mechanism by analyzing seizure
   susceptibility to the convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in a novel
   rodent tauopathy model. A single dose of PTZ was systemically injected
   in Tau58/4 transgenic mice. To investigate whether young and aged
   heterozygous (HET) mice exhibit a higher susceptibility to seizures in
   comparison with wild-type (WT) littermates, video electroencephalography
   (EEG) in combination with behavioral scoring according to a modified
   Racine scale was used. The employment of different dosage groups enabled
   us to characterize the dose range reliably inducing seizures. Here, we
   report an increased seizure susceptibility in young but not in old HET
   Tau58/4 mice. Young HET animals displayed more severe seizures and had a
   reduced latency to the first seizure compared to WTs. Also, age-related
   differences in susceptibility could be demonstrated for both genotypes.
   Identification and targeting of secondary diseases such as epilepsy,
   which aggravate dementia and lead to earlier institutionalization, is
   key. This study finds that tau pathology itself is sufficient to alter
   seizure susceptibility in a rodent model, indicating that the disease
   process is crucial in the emergence of epilepsy in patients with
   tauopathy. (C) 2019 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   imaging for up to 6 years. Resting-state MRI was used to estimate
   connectivity of seven canonical neural networks using template-based

   that displayed significant changes in connectivity across time. We
   investigated associations among amyloid and longitudinal changes in
   connectivity and cognitive function by domains. Results Left middle
   frontal gyrus connectivity within the memory encoding network increased
   over time, but the rate of change was lower with greater amyloid. This
   was no longer significant in an analysis where we limited the sample to
   only those with two time points. We found limited decline in cognitive
   domains overall. Greater functional connectivity was associated with
   better attention/processing speed and executive function (independent of

Abstract = {{Age at symptom onset (AAO) underlies different Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   clinical variants: late-onset AD (LOAD) is characterized by memory
   deficits, while early-onset AD (EOAD) presents predominantly with
   non-memory symptoms. The involvement of different neural networks may
   explain these distinct clinical phenotypes. In this study, we tested the
   hypothesis of an early and selective involvement of neural networks
   based on AAO in AD. Twenty memory clinic patients with prodromal AD
   (i.e., mild cognitive impairment with an AD-like cerebrospinal fluid
   profile) and 30 healthy controls underwent a cognitive evaluation and a
   resting state functional MRI exam. Independent component analysis was
   performed to assess functional connectivity (FC) in the following
   networks: default mode, frontoparietal, limbic, visual, and
   sensorimotor. Patients were stratified into late-onset (pLOAD) and
   early-onset (pEOAD) prodromal AD according to the AAO and controls were
   stratified into younger and older groups accordingly. Decreased FC
   within the default mode and the limbic networks was observed in pLOAD,
   while pEOAD showed lower FC in the frontoparietal and visual networks.
   The sensorimotor network did not show differences between groups. A
   significant association was found between memory and limbic network FC
   in pLOAD, and between executive functions and frontoparietal network FC
   in pEOAD, although the latter association did not survive multiple
   comparison correction. Our findings indicate that aberrant connectivity
   in memory networks is associated with pLOAD, while networks underlying
   executive and visuo-spatial functions are affected in pEOAD. These
   findings are in line with the hypothesis that the pathophysiological
   mechanisms underlying EOAD and LOAD are distinct.}},

Abstract = {{Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are becoming prominent models
   for semi-automated diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using brain
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Although being highly accurate, deep
   CNN models lack transparency and interpretability, precluding adequate
   clinical reasoning and not complying with most current regulatory
   demands. One popular choice for explaining deep image models is
   occluding regions of the image to isolate their influence on the
   prediction. However, existing methods for occluding patches of brain
   scans generate images outside the distribution to which the model was
   trained for, thus leading to unreliable explanations. In this paper, we
   propose an alternative explanation method that is specifically designed
   for the brain scan task. Our method, which we refer to as Swap Test,
   produces heatmaps that depict the areas of the brain that are most
   indicative of AD, providing interpretability for the model's decisions
   in a format understandable to clinicians. Experimental results using an
   axiomatic evaluation show that the proposed method is more suitable for
   explaining the diagnosis of AD using MRI while the opposite trend was
   observed when using a typical occlusion test. Therefore, we believe our
   method may address the inherent black-box nature of deep neural networks
   that are capable of diagnosing AD.}},

   to present a diverging reception area by increasing the filter size and

Abstract = {{Purpose: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and Alzheimer's

   Recently, many studies on the segmentation, disease detection, or

   of this study was to differentiate iNPH and All using a residual
   extraction approach in the deep learning method.
   Methods: Twenty-three patients with iNPH, 23 patients with AD and 23
   healthy controls were included in this study. All patients and
   volunteers underwent brain MRI with a 3T unit, and we used only
   whole-brain three-dimensional (3D) T-1-weighted images. We designed a

   out of 23 controls were correctly diagnosed. The accuracy was 0.90. In
   the Grad-CAM heat map, brain parenchyma surrounding the lateral
   ventricle was highlighted in about half of the iNPH cases that were
   successfully diagnosed. The medial temporal lobe or inferior horn of the
   lateral ventricle was highlighted in many successfully diagnosed cases
   of AD. About half of the successful cases showed nonspecific heat maps.
   Conclusion: Residual extraction approach in a deep learning method
   achieved a high accuracy for the differential diagnosis of iNPH, AD, and
   healthy controls trained with a small number of cases.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate diagnosis and prediction for individuals is crucial in
   computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The existing
   structural magnetic resonance imaging based classification methods of AD
   diagnosis mainly focus on the voxel level, region level and patch level
   morphological pattern analysis. However, most of these methods extract
   features with high dimension which may lead to overfitting problem.
   Besides, the interaction of different patches is not considered in the
   classifier ensemble. In this article, we propose a novel anatomical
   landmarks and directed acyclic graph (DAG) network feature learning
   based classification algorithm for the diagnosis of AD individuals.
   First, the anatomical feature patches of gray matter image are
   identified by the morphological and statistical analysis. Second, a
   simple and efficient DAG convolutional neural network is proposed to
   extract the discriminative deep features of image representation.
   Especially, the deep features are obtained by fusing feature maps of
   different network levels which contain semantic high-level and
   high-resolution low-level features. Finally, support vector machine and
   deep features are utilized to construct the classification model and
   predict the individual of AD. Experiments on three public datasets
   including ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and MIRIAD demonstrate that the proposed method
   can effectively improve the classification performance compared with the
   state-of-the-art methods for AD diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Postmortem studies of Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains not
   only find amyloid-beta (A beta) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the
   primary and associative visual cortical areas, but also reveal a
   temporally successive sequence of AD pathology beginning in higher-order
   visual association areas, followed by involvement of lower-order visual
   processing regions with disease progression, and extending to primary
   visual cortex in late-stage disease. These findings suggest that
   neuronal loss associated with A beta and NFT aggregation in these areas
   may alter not only the local neuronal activation but also visual neural
   network activity.
   Objective: Applying a novel method to identify the visual functional
   network and investigate the association of the network changes with
   disease progression.
   Methods: To investigate the effect of AD on the face-evoked
   visual-processing network, 8 severe AD (SAD) patients, 11 mild/moderate
   AD (MAD), and 26 healthy senior (HS) controls undertook a task-fMRI
   study of viewing face photos.
   Results: For the HS, the identified group-mean visual-processing network
   in the ventral pathway started from V1 and ended within the fusiform
   gyrus. In contrast, this network was disrupted and reduced in the AD
   patients in a disease-severity dependent manner: for the MAD patients,
   the networkwas disrupted and reduced mainly in the higher-order visual
   association areas; for the SAD patients, the network was nearly absent
   in the higher-order association areas, and disrupted and reduced in the
   lower-order areas.
   Conclusion: This finding is consistent with the current canonical viewof
   the temporally successive sequence ofADpathology through visual cortical
   areas.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease (AD) which causes declination of cognitive function
   is one of the most severe social issues in the world. It has already
   been known that AD cannot be cured and treatment can only delay its
   progression. Therefore, it is very important to detect AD in early stage
   and prevent it to be worse. Furthermore, sooner the progression is
   detected, better the prognosis will be. In this research, we developed a
   novel multi-modal deep learning method to predict conversion from Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is the stage between cognitively
   normal older people and AD. In our method, the multi-modal input data
   are defined as structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images and
   clinical data including several cognitive scores, APOE genotype, gender
   and age obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort
   (ADNI). Our criteria of selecting these input data are that they are
   mostly obtained by non-invasive examination. The proposed method
   integrates features obtained from MRI images and clinical data
   effectively by using bi-linear fusion. Bi-linear fusion computes the
   products of all elements between image and clinical features, where the
   correlation between them are included. That led to a big improvement of
   prediction accuracy in the experiment. The prediction model using
   bi-linear fusion achieved to predict conversion in one year with 0.86
   accuracy, comparing with 0.76 accuracy using linear fusion. The proposed
   method is useful for screening examination for AD or deciding a
   stratification approach within clinical trials since it achieved a high
   accuracy while the input data is relatively easy to be obtained.}},

Abstract = {{Current techniques trying to predict Alzheimer's disease at an
   early-stage explore the structural information of T1-weighted MR Images.
   Among these techniques, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) is the
   most promising since it has been successfully used in a variety of
   medical imaging problems. However, the majority of works on Alzheimer's
   Disease tackle the binary classification problem only, i.e., to
   distinguish Normal Controls from Alzheimer's Disease patients. Only a
   few works deal with the multiclass problem, namely, patient
   classification into one of the three groups: Normal Control (NC),
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). In this
   paper, our primary goal is to tackle the 3-class AD classification
   problem using T1-weighted MRI and a 2D CNN approach. We used the first
   two layers of ResNet34 as feature extractor and then trained a
   classifier using 64 x 64 sized patches from coronal 2D MRI slices. Our
   extended-2D CNN proposal explores the MRI volumetric information, by
   using non-consecutive 2D slices as input channels of the CNN, while
   maintaining the low computational costs associated with a 2D approach.
   The proposed model, trained and tested on images from ADNI dataset,
   achieved an accuracy of 68.6\% for the multiclass problem, presenting
   the best performance when compared to state-of-the-art AD classification
   methods, even the 3D-CNN based ones.}},

Abstract = {{Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) plays an important role in
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection as it shows morphological changes
   caused by brain atrophy. Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been
   successfully used to achieve good performance in accurate diagnosis of

   to the small amount of sMRI data, which limits the ability of CNN to
   learn high-level features. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel
   unified CNN framework for AD identification, where both 3D CNN and 3D
   convolutional long short-term memory (3D CLSTM) are employed.
   Specifically, we firstly exploit a 6-layer 3D CNN to learn informative
   features, then 3D CLSTM is leveraged to further extract the channel-wise
   higher-level information. Extensive experimental results on ADNI dataset
   show that our model has achieved an accuracy of 94.19\% for AD
   detection, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and indicates

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia.
   Neuroimaging data is an integral part of the clinical assessment
   providing a way for clinicians to detect brain abnormalities for AD
   diagnosis. Anatomical MRI has been widely used to assess structural
   brain atrophy for AD detection and prediction. In addition to structural
   changes, metabolic changes in some brain regions such as the Posterior
   Cingulate Cortex (PCC) could be a good bio-marker for an early AD
   detection. Recently, proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS)
   have been proved to be effective to reveal a wealth of brain metabolic
   information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep leaning
   Network for early AD and Normal Control (NC) subjects classification
   using 1H-MRS raw data from the PCC area. This work is the first
   investigation of 1H-MRS data with deep-learning technique for early AD
   detection. Data of 135 subjects, collected in Poitiers university

Abstract = {{The prediction of the conversion of healthy individuals and those with
   mild cognitive impairment to the status of active Alzheimer's disease is
   a challenging task. Recently, a survival analysis based upon deep
   learning was developed to enable predictions regarding the timing of an
   event in a dataset containing censored data. Here, we investigated
   whether a deep survival analysis could similarly predict the conversion
   to Alzheimer's disease. We selected individuals with mild cognitive
   impairment and cognitively normal subjects and used the grey matter
   volumes of brain regions in these subjects as predictive features. We
   then compared the prediction performances of the traditional standard
   Cox proportional-hazard model, the DeepHit model and our deep survival
   model based on a Weibull distribution. Our model achieved a maximum
   concordance index of 0.835, which was higher than that yielded by the
   Cox model and comparable to that of the DeepHit model. To our best
   knowledge, this is the first report to describe the application of a
   deep survival model to brain magnetic resonance imaging data. Our
   results demonstrate that this type of analysis could successfully
   predict the time of an individual's conversion to Alzheimer's disease.}},

   the cells very early, but the others detect changes as a disease affects
   the organs or tissue structure. Since it rises, Positron Emission
   Tomography gained a serious role in the diagnosis and treatment of brain
   disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Dementia, in
   addition to tumors. Because of the high level of chemical activity that
   exists in abnormal tissues such as cancer cells, these cells will show
   up as bright spots on these scans. This can play a major role in the
   diagnostic process if modern image processing methods are used to
   identify bright areas, as it will assist specialists in the diagnostic
   process and monitor the pathological condition during the treatment
   period. In this paper we summarize the most prominent methods used in
   processing positron images, starting from the traditional stages through
   to machine learning techniques and then to deep learning that occupies a
   large area in recent days.}},

Abstract = {{There are many solutions for detection and classification and
   classification of dementia into its corresponding patterns using PET,
   SPECT, MRT, fMRT addressing to the classification based on the patterns.
   They are classified based on the corresponding diseased and Non-diseased
   Syndrome types. Here in this scope, solution anticipated to the
   inter-related disease with Picks Syndrome (PD) and Alzheimers Disease
   Syndrome (AD). The image data sets implied her are the functional
   Magnetic Resonance Images. The images become very contrasting based on
   many parameters - capturing intensity, noise content, geographical
   locations, Image acquisition based on the different corporate machines,
   capability of the Radiologist, the moment during the motion capturing,
   patient nature, etc., and hence many more features that comes into the
   account. Ultimately this effects the intensity and the noise level
   imposed during the motion capturing. A Daubechies Wavelet Transform is
   implied here. Its properties are: 1) Smoothening filters 2) extraction
   of frequency (feature) components 3) Median filter - removing the random
   noises better. A fourth level of extraction of features using the
   Wavelet Decomposition by Daubechies type was implied for formation of
   the feature vectors. From the sub-band regions of H-H level order with
   fourth level of decomposition level which will have high resolution was
   chosen for this act. Other have low-high combinatory, and fourth band
   has low - low combination which are very difficult to pick up the
   resolution points. This obtained features were implied for feature
   vector formation. The extraction of the features was obtained from the
   approximated co-efficients got from the Approximated sub-band levels
   thus chosen to form the input images and extracted co-efficients were
   fed to design, train and test the network for convergence, network
   framing and efficiency estimation respectively. A Self Organizing Map
   technique was chosen for designing up of the network using the
   Competitive Neural Network. This was used to classify the normal and
   Dementia based image types into its corresponding types. This enables a
   good proviso for designing up of the network and also provides
   efficiency in convergence of the network, classification of the two
   types of diseases and also in classification of the disease types into
   its individual inter dependent types such as Demential and Non-Demential
   types.}},

Abstract = {{The prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients who are at
   higher risk converting to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is critical for
   effective intervention and patient selection in clinical trials.
   Different biomarkers including neuroimaging have been developed to serve
   the purpose. With extensive methodology development efforts on
   neuroimaging, an emerging field is deep learning research. One great
   challenge facing deep learning is the limited medical imaging data
   available. To address the issue, researchers explore the use of transfer
   learning to extend the applicability of deep models on neuroimaging
   research for AD diagnosis and prognosis. Existing transfer learning
   models mostly focus on transferring the features from the pre-training
   into the fine-tuning stage. Recognizing the advantages of the knowledge
   gained during the pre-training, we propose an AD-NET (Age-adjust neural
   network) with the pre-training model serving two purposes: extracting
   and transferring features; and obtaining and transferring knowledge.
   Specifically, the knowledge being transferred in this research is an
   age-related surrogate biomarker. To evaluate the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach, AD-NET is compared with 8 classification models from
   literature using the same public neuroimaging dataset. Experimental
   results show that the proposed AD-NET outperforms the competing models
   in predicting the MCI patients at risk for conversion to the AD stage.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{27}},
Abstract = {{Background: Manual segmentation is currently the gold standard to assess
   white matter hyperintensities (WMH), but it is time consuming and
   subject to intra and inter-operator variability.
   Purpose: To compare automatic methods to segment white matter
   hyperintensities (WMH) in the elderly in order to assist radiologist and
   researchers in selecting the most relevant method for application on
   clinical or research data.
   Material and Methods: We studied a research dataset composed of 147
   patients, including 97 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 database and 50 patients from ADNI 3
   and a clinical routine dataset comprising 60 patients referred for
   cognitive impairment at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital (imaged using
   four different MRI machines). We used manual segmentation as the gold
   standard reference. Both manual and automatic segmentations were
   performed using FLAIR MRI. We compared seven freely available methods
   that produce segmentation mask and are usable by a radiologist without a
   strong knowledge of com- puter programming: LGA (Schmidt et al., 2012),
   LPA (Schmidt. 2017), BIANCA (Griffanti et al., 2016), UBO detector
   (Jiang et al., 2018), W2MHS (Ithapu et al., 2014), nicMSlesion (with and
   without retraining) (Valverde et al., 2019, 2017). The primary outcome
   for assessing segmentation accuracy was the Dice similarity coefficient
   (DSC) between the manual and the automatic segmentation software.
   Secondary outcomes included five other metrics.
   Results: A deep learning approach, NicMSlesion, retrained on data from
   the research dataset ADNI, performed best on this research dataset (DSC:
   0.595) and its DSC was significantly higher than that of all others.
   However, it ranked fifth on the clinical routine dataset and its
   performance severely dropped on data with artifacts. On the clinical
   routine dataset, the three top-ranked methods were LPA, SLS and BIANCA.
   Their performance did not differ significantly but was significantly
   higher than that of other methods.
   Conclusion: This work provides an objective comparison of methods for
   WMH segmentation. Results can be used by radiologists to select a tool.}},

Title = {{BioCNN: A Hardware Inference Engine for EEG-Based Emotion Detection}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{140896-140914}},
Abstract = {{EEG-based emotion classifiers have the potential of significantly
   improving the social integration of patients suffering from neurological
   disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis or the acute stages of
   Alzheimer's disease. Emotion classifiers have historically used software
   on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions.
   Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable
   the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires
   the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near
   real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this
   article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted,
   hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for
   EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG
   signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely,
   Emotiv Epoc C, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by
   BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of
   emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP
   and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house
   from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. Asubject-specific
   training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is
   implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6
   FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of
   11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1:65 GOps that is in line with the real-time
   specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms,
   which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times.
   Its emotion inference accuracy is competitive with the top
   software-based emotion detectors.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate segmentation of brain tissues, such as gray matter (GM), white
   matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), in magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) images, is helpful for the diagnosis of neurological
   disorders, such as schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, and dementia.
   Studies on MRI-based brain segmentation have received significant
   attention in recent years based on the non-invasive imaging and good
   soft-tissue contrast provided by MRI. A number of studies have used
   conventional machine learning strategies, as well as convolutional
   neural network approaches. In this paper, we propose a patch-wise M-net
   architecture for the automatic segmentation of brain MRI images. In the
   proposed brain segmentation method, slices from a brain MRI scan are
   divided into non-overlapping patches, which are then fed into an M-net
   model with corresponding ground-truth patches to train the network,
   which is composed of two encoder-decoder processes. Dilated
   convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in the encoder and
   decoder modules to derive abundant semantic features from brain MRI
   scans. The proposed patch-wise M-net overcomes the drawbacks of
   conventional methods and provides greater retention of fine details. The
   proposed M-net model was trained and tested on the open-access series of
   imaging studies dataset. The performance was measured quantitatively
   using the Dice similarity coefficient. Experimental results demonstrate
   that the proposed method achieves average segmentation accuracies of
   94.81\% for CSF, 95.44\% for GM, and 96.33\% for WM, meaning it
   outperforms state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Automated brain segmentation is an active research domain due to the
   association of various neurological disorders with different regions of
   the brain, to help medical professionals in prognostics and diagnostics.
   Traditional techniques like atlas-based and pattern recognition-based
   methods led to the development of various tools for automated brain
   segmentation. Recently, deep learning techniques are outperforming
   classical state-of-the-art methods and gradually becoming more mature.
   Consequently, deep learning has been extensively employed as a tool for
   precise segmentation of brain regions because of its capability to learn
   the intricate features of the high-dimensional data. In this work, a
   network for the segmentation of multiple brain regions has been proposed
   that is based on 3D convolutional neural networks and utilizes residual
   learning and dilated convolution operations to efficiently learn the
   end-to-end mapping from MRI volumes to the voxel-level brain segments.
   This research is focused on the segmentation of up to nine brain regions
   including cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and gray matter as well as
   their sub-regions. Mean dice scores of 0.879 and 0.914 have been
   achieved for three and nine brain regions, respectively by using the
   data from three different sources. Comparative analysis shows that our

   for eight brain regions segmentation with MRBrains18 dataset, is better

   biomarkers is vital in Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. Convolutional
   neural networks (CNN) have been proved to be powerful for various
   computer vision research by refining reliable and high-level feature
   maps from image patches.
   Objective: A key challenge in applying CNN to neuroimaging research is
   the limited labeled samples with high dimensional features. Another
   challenge is how to improve the prediction accuracy by joint analysis of
   multiple data sources (i.e., multiple time points or multiple
   biomarkers). To address these two challenges, we propose a novel
   multi-task learning framework based on CNN.
   Methods: First, we pre-trained CNN on the ImageNet dataset and
   transferred the knowledge from the pre-trained model to neuroimaging
   representation. We used this deep model as feature extractor to generate
   high-level feature maps of different tasks. Then a novel unsupervised
   learning method, termed Multi-task Stochastic Coordinate Coding (MSCC),
   was proposed for learning sparse features of multi-task feature maps by
   using shared and individual dictionaries. Finally, Lasso regression was
   performed on these multi-task sparse features to predict AD progression
   measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Alzheimer's

   Results: We applied this novel CNN-MSCC system on the Alzheimer's

Abstract = {{Automatic hippocampal volume measurement from brain magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) is a crucial task and an important research area,
   especially in the study of neurodegenerative diseases; hippocampal
   volume atrophy is known to be connected with Alzheimer's disease. In
   this research work, we propose a deep learning-based method to
   automatically measure the discrete hippocampal volume without prior
   segmentation of the volumetric MRI scans. We constructed a 2-D
   convolutional neural network (CNN) model that uses 3-channel 2-D patches
   to predict the number of voxels attributed to the hippocampus; the
   number of estimated hippocampal voxels is multiplied by the voxel volume
   to measure the discrete volume of the hippocampus. In addition, we
   demonstrate a preprocessing scheme to prepare the data using a
   relatively small number of MRI scans. The average errors in the measured
   volumes of the proposed approach and the compared atlas-based system
   were 4.3173 +/- 3.5436 (avg. error\% +/- STD) and 4.1562 +/- 3.5262
   (avg. error \% +/- STD) for the left and right hippocampi, respectively.
   The correlation coefficients of the proposed approach with atlas-based
   volume measurement were statistically significant (p-value < 0.01,
   R-2=0.834 (left hippocampus) and R-2=0.848 (right hippocampus) based on
   0.05 significance level), which suggests that the proposed approach can
   be used as a proxy method for the atlas-based system. Furthermore, the
   proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires less than 2
   seconds to calculate the number of voxels for an MRI scan. Moreover, our
   method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approach, such as
   2-D U-Net and SegNet in the context of voxel/volume estimation errors\%

Abstract = {{Pulse coupled neural network (PCNN) is widely used in image fusion
   framework due to its global coupling and pulse synchronization of
   neurons. However, its manual setting of parameters and inability to

   novel weighted parameter adaptive dual channel PCNN (WPADCPCNN) based
   medical fusion method is proposed in non-subsampled shearlet transform
   domain to fuse the magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission
   computed tomography images of AIDS dementia complex and Alzheimer's
   disease patients. The parameters of the proposed WPADCPCNN model are
   estimated from its inputs using fractal dimension. The high-pass
   sub-bands are fused using the WPADCPCNN model whereas the low-pass
   sub-bands are merged using a new weighted multi-scale morphological
   gradients based rule. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed

   visual quality and objective assessment.}},

Title = {{Longitudinal degradation of the default/salience network axis in
   symptomatic individuals with elevated amyloid burden}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{26}},
Abstract = {{Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a non-invasive
   imaging technique that has come into increasing use to understand
   disrupted neural network function in neuropsychiatric disease. However,
   despite extensive study over the past 15 years, the development of
   rs-fcMRI as a biomarker has been impeded by a lack of reliable
   longitudinal rs-fcMRI measures. Here we focus on longitudinal change
   along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectory and demonstrate the
   utility of Template Based Rotation (TBR) in detecting differential
   longitudinal rs-fcMRI change between higher and lower amyloid burden
   individuals with mildly impaired cognition. Specifically, we examine a
   small (N = 24), but densely sampled (similar to 5 observations over
   similar to 3 years), cohort of symptomatic individuals with serial
   rs-fcMRI imaging and PiB-PET imaging for -amyloid pathology. We observed
   longitudinal decline of the Default Mode and Salience network axis
   (DMN/SAL) among impaired individuals with high amyloid burden. No other
   networks showed differential change in high vs. low amyloid individuals
   over time. The standardized effect size of AD related DMN/SAL change is
   comparable to the standardized effect size of amyloid-related change on
   the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and hippocampal volume (HV). Last, we
   show that the AD-related change in DMN/SAL connectivity is almost
   completely independent of change on MMSE or HV, suggesting that rsfcMRI
   is sensitive to an aspect of AD progression that is not captured by
   these other measures. Together these analyses demonstrate that
   longitudinal rs-fcMRI using TBR can capture disease-relevant network
   disruption in a clinical population.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus plays an important role in the memory and cognition
   abilities of humans. Precise three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the

   the irregular shape and small volume of the hippocampus. We propose a
   novel two-stage segmentation method, which includes a localization stage
   and a segmentation stage, to handle the task of the 3D segmentation of
   the hippocampus. In the localization stage, a novel strategy for
   localizing multi-size candidate regions was developed to improve the
   sample balance for the 3D segmentation task. In the segmentation stage,
   a method which fuses the multi-size candidate regions was proposed to
   improve the accuracy in predicting the hippocampal boundary, after which

   further improve the performance. Quantitative evaluation was performed

Title = {{Ambivert degree identifies crucial brain functional hubs and improves
   detection of Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{25}},
Abstract = {{Functional modules in the human brain support its drive for
   specialization whereas brain hubs act as focal points for information
   integration. Brain hubs are brain regions that have a large number of
   both within and between module connections. We argue that weak
   connections in brain functional networks lead to misclassification of
   brain regions as hubs. In order to resolve this, we propose a new
   measure called ambivert degree that considers the node's degree as well
   as connection weights in order to identify nodes with both high degree
   and high connection weights as hubs. Using resting-state functional MRI
   scans from the Human Connectome Project, we show that ambivert degree
   identifies brain hubs that are not only crucial but also invariable
   across subjects. We hypothesize that nodal measures based on ambivert
   degree can be effectively used to classify patients from healthy
   controls for diseases that are known to have widespread hub disruption.
   Using patient data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder,
   we show that the hubs in the patient and healthy groups are very
   different for both the diseases and deep feedforward neural networks
   trained on nodal hub features lead to a significantly higher
   classification accuracy with significantly fewer trainable weights
   compared to using functional connectivity features. Thus, the ambivert
   degree improves identification of crucial brain hubs in healthy subjects
   and can be used as a diagnostic feature to detect neurological diseases
   characterized by hub disruption.}},

Title = {{Single-slice Alzheimer's disease classification and disease regional
   analysis with Supervised Switching Autoencoders}},
Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2020}},
Volume = {{116}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult to diagnose
   pathology of the brain that progressively impairs cognitive functions.
   Computer-assisted diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging
   tool to support AD diagnosis. In this article, we explore the
   application of Supervised Switching Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD
   classification using only one structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder architectures,
   combining unsupervised representation and supervised classification as
   one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of SSAs to
   capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease
   semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to
   disease state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based
   approach.
   Methods: Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches
   extracted from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and
   Sagittal anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative
   locations, exploring different patch sizes and network
   parameterizations. Then, models perform binary class prediction -
   healthy (CDR = 0) or AD-demented (CDR > 0) - on test data at patch
   level. The final subject classification is performed employing a
   majority rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition,
   relevant regions are identified, by computing accuracy densities from
   patch-level predictions, and analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional
   definitions.
   Results: Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per
   subject show that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely
   on full volumetric information and feature-engineered representations.
   SSAs classification accuracy on slices extracted along the Axial,
   Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes from a balanced cohort of 40
   independent test subjects was 87.5\%, 90.0\%, and 90.0\%, respectively.
   A top sensitivity of 95.0\% on both Coronal and Sagittal planes was also
   obtained.
   Conclusions: SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among
   previous classification proposals, including feature-engineered and
   feature learning based methods, using only one scan slice per subject,
   instead of the whole 3D volume, as it is conventionally done. In
   addition, regions identified as relevant by SSAs' were, in most part,
   coherent or partially coherent in regard to relevant regions reported on
   previous works. These regions were also associated with findings from
   medical knowledge, which gives value to our methodology as a potential
   analytical aid for disease understanding.}},

Abstract = {{We performed this research to 1) evaluate a novel deep learning method

   3-dimensional (3-D) independent component spatial maps for use as
   features in classification and regression tasks. A 3-D convolutional

   task. MMSE scores were predicted using: linear least square regression
   (LLSR), support vector regression, bagging-based ensemble regression,
   and tree regression with group independent component analysis (gICA)
   features. To improve MMSE regression performance, we applied feature
   optimization methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator and support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination
   (SVM-RFE). The mean balanced test accuracy was 85.27\% for the
   classification of AD versus healthy controls. The medial visual, default
   mode, dorsal attention, executive, and auditory related networks were
   mainly associated with AD. The maximum clinical MMSE score prediction
   accuracy with the LLSR method applied on gICA combined with SVM-RFE
   features had the lowest root mean square error (3.27 +/- 0.58) and the
   highest R-2 value (0.63 +/- 0.02). Classification of AD and healthy
   controls can be successfully achieved using only rs-fMRI and MMSE scores
   can be accurately predicted using functional independent component
   features. In the absence of trained clinicians, AD disease status and
   clinical MMSE scores can be jointly predicted using 3-D deep learning
   and regression learning approaches with rs-fMRI data.}},

Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Automatic segmentation of brain sub regions such as White Matter (GM),
   Corpus Callosum (CC), Grey Matter (WM) and Hippocampus (HC) is a
   challenging task due to the variations in the structure of the brain.
   The development of an automation process will help in identifying the
   Alzheimer disease (AD). The maximum distinctive AD related to neuronal
   loss in the brain sub regions is GM, WM, CC and HC. Several nature
   optimization algorithms are being developed to get an optimum solution
   for segmenting these kinds of very hectic regions. In this work, brain
   sub regions have been considered to diagnose the AD using four various
   optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm
   Optimization algorithm (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Cuckoo
   Search (CS). Among these optimization techniques, GWO shows promising
   results due to the proper selection of global optimum solution. The
   segmented regions have been classified using deep learning classifier
   and it has been validated with Ground Truth (GT) images. The results
   prove that GWO is capable to segment the brain sub regions with high
   accuracy of 98\% similarity among the ground truth and segmented region.
   Then, the segmented regions are classified using deep learning
   classifier and the results show the high accuracy of 95\%. From the
   above sub regions, HC proves better classification accuracy of 95\%,
   sensitivity as 95\% and specificity as 94\% compared to all other
   regions. Based on the output of segmentation and classification measures
   it is clearly observed that, the proposed method provide better
   performance than other methods. Finally, the normal and AD subjects are
   also validated clinically with mini mental state examination (MMSE)
   score. From this evaluation it is observed that, the proposed work is
   highly correlated with MMSE score. Therefore, the proposed pipeline
   witnessed that the HC region is the major factor for diagnosing AD. (C)

Abstract = {{Purpose Knowing the course of Alzheimer's disease is very important to
   prevent the deterioration of the disease, and accurate segmentation of
   sensitive lesions can provide a visual basis for the diagnosis results.
   This study proposes an improved end-to-end dual-functional 3D
   convolutional neural network for segmenting bilateral hippocampi from 3D
   brain MRI scans and diagnosing AD progression states simultaneously.
   Methods The proposed neural network is based on the V-Net and adopts an
   end-to-end structure. In order to relieve the excessive amount of
   convolutional parameters at the bottom of the V-Net, we change them to
   bottleneck architecture. Based on the segmentation network, we establish
   a classification network for diagnosing pathological states of brain. In
   order to balance the two tasks of hippocampi segmentation and brain
   pathological states diagnosis, we designed a unique loss function. This
   study included 132 samples, of which 100 were selected as training, and
   the remaining 32 were used to test the performance of our model. During
   training, we adopted fivefold cross-validation method. Results We
   selected the intersection over union and dice coefficient to evaluate
   the hippocampus segmentation performance, while the brain pathological
   states diagnosis performance was evaluated by accuracy, specificity,
   sensitivity, precision and F1 score. By using the proposed neural
   network, the left hippocampi segmentation Iou and dice coefficient reach
   0.8240 +/- 0.020 and 0.9035 +/- 0.020, respectively. The right
   hippocampi Iou and dice coefficient reach 0.8454 +/- 0.023 and 0.9162
   +/- 0.023, respectively. The accuracy, specificity, sensitivity,
   precision and F1 score of three-category classification of brain
   pathology are 84\%, 92\%, 84\%, 86\% and 85\%, respectively. Conclusion
   The proposed neural network has two functions of brain pathological
   states diagnosis and bilateral hippocampi segmentation with higher
   robustness and accuracy, respectively. The segmented bilateral
   hippocampi can be used as a reference for clinical decision making or
   intervention.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder
   accounting for 70\%-80\% dementia cases worldwide. Although, research on
   AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated
   with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this
   disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used
   to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature,
   the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification
   or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to
   diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied.
   This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class
   classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI,
   MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138
   subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To
   provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their
   applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture
   in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using
   single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and
   without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We
   experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification
   task and compared it with former research in this domain. The
   performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall,
   f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to
   significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with
   our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100\%,
   96.85\%, 97.38\%, 97.43\%, 97.40\% and 98.01\% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI,
   MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we
   achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92\%
   and 97.88\% for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The
   Analysis of results indicate that classification and prediction of
   neurodegenerative brain disorders such as AD using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging and advanced deep learning methods is promising for
   clinical decision making and have the potential to assist in early
   diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.}},

Abstract = {{Microstructural and macrostructural white matter damage occurs
   frequently with aging, is associated with negative health outcomes, and
   can be imaged non-invasively as fractional anisotropy (FA) and white
   matter hyperintensities (WMH), respectively. The extent to which
   diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white
   matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis
   that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young
   adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine
   younger participants (age = 25.8 +/- 2.8 years) underwent
   diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9
   +/- 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution
   with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of
   frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older
   adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter
   microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop
   macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in
   which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH
   in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions
   frequently segmented as WMH in older adults. We conclude that low white
   matter microstructure is observed in areas of white matter
   macrostructural damage, but white matter microstructure is also
   normatively low (i.e., at ages 20-30) in regions with high WMH
   frequency, prior to white matter macrostructural damage.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Unawareness, or anosognosia, of memory deficits is a
   challenging manifestation of Alzheimer disease (AD) that adversely
   affects a patient's safety and decision-making. However, there is a lack
   of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of
   altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and
   prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in
   awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta-amyloid (A
   beta) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the
   disease spectrum. Methods Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed
   (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the
   discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday
   Cognition scale (memory domain). A beta deposition was measured at
   baseline using {[}18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging.
   Results A beta predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such
   that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased A beta
   burden. A beta and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory
   awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants,
   but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In
   a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before
   MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of
   progression to MCI (-0.08 discrepant-points/yr). In a subset of MCI
   participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and
   continued to decline (-0.23 discrepant-points/yr), reaching anosognosia
   3.2 years before dementia onset. Interpretation A beta burden is
   associated with a progressive decrease in self-awareness of memory
   deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia

   Convolutional Neural Network and Transfer Learning}},
Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{DEC 3}},
Abstract = {{Recently, deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed for the
   classification of neuroimaging data related to Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   and significant progress has been made. However, end-to-end learning
   that is capable of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to
   receive much attention due to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging
   caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, this study presents an approach
   meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a volumetric convolutional
   neural network (CNN) model for four binary classification tasks (AD vs.
   normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) vs.
   NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI)
   based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its outcomes in
   terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In the
   proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based
   unsupervised learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and
   supervised transfer learning is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI
   classification task. To detect the most important biomarkers related to
   AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization method that approximates the
   spatial influence of the CNN model's decision was applied. To validate
   the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments on the ADNI
   database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach
   achieved the accuracies of 86.60\% and 73.95\% for the AD and pMCI

Journal = {{COMPUTERS IN BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{115}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: Medical image synthesis can simulate a target modality of
   interest based on existing modalities and has the potential to save
   scanning time while contributing to efficient data collection. This
   study proposed a three-dimensional (3D) deep learning architecture based
   on a fully convolutional network (FCN) to synthesize diffusion-tensor
   imaging (DTI) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI).
   Methods: fMRI signals derived from white matter (WM) exist and can be
   used for assessing WM alterations. We constructed an initial functional
   correlation tensor image using the correlation patterns of adjacent fMRI
   voxels as one input to the FCN. We considered T1-weighted images as an
   additional input to provide an algorithm with the structural information
   needed to synthesize DTI. Our architecture was trained and tested using
   a large-scale open database dataset (training n = 648; testing n = 293).
   Results: The average correlation value between synthesized and actual
   diffusion tensors for 38 WM regions was 0.808, which significantly
   improves upon an existing study (r = 0.480). We also validated our
   approach using two open databases. Our proposed method showed a higher
   correlation with the actual diffusion tensor than the conventional
   machine-learning method for many WM regions.
   Conclusions: Our method synthesized DTI images from fMRI images using a
   3D FCN architecture. We hope to expand our method of synthesizing
   various other imaging modalities from a single image source.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hoarding and obsessive-compulsive behaviours (OCB) are well
   documented symptoms in frontotemporal dementia (FTD). While contemporary
   models consider hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorder distinct, the
   related behaviours have not been separately examined in patients with
   FTD, and the neuroanatomical correlates of hoarding in patients with FTD
   have not been previously examined (American Psychiatric Association,
   2013; Grisham and Baldwin, 2015; Mataix-Cols et al., 2010).
   Methods: Patients with FTD who were evaluated between 2004 and 2018 at
   our centre were included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric
   analyses were completed on available T1 high resolution anatomic scans
   using FreeSurfer.
   Results: Eighty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, and 49 had scans
   available for quantitative MRI volumetric analysis. New hoarding
   behaviours were present in 29\% of patients and were more common in the
   semantic variant subtype of FTD, while 49\% of individuals had new or
   increased OCB. Hoarding behaviours were associated with decreased
   thickness in a factor comprised of left temporal, insular and anterior
   cingulate cortices. The presence of OCB was predicted by reduced
   cortical thickness and volumes in a factor comprised of the anterior
   cingulate and subcortical volumes in the bilateral amygdala and
   hippocampus. OCB were associated with greater right temporal cortical
   thickness in comparison to patients with hoarding.
   Discussion: The association of the semantic variant with hoarding,
   together with the observed associations between left temporal atrophy
   and hoarding indicate that degeneration of the left temporal lobe has a
   role in the emergence of hoarding in FTD. As in current models of
   Hoarding disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder, our results suggest
   that in patients with FTD, hoarding and OCB are clinically and
   anatomically partially dissociable phenomenon. The results may also help
   to further elucidate the cognitive processes and neural networks
   contributing to Hoarding disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder in
   persons without dementia. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Our understanding on human neurodegenerative disease was previously
   limited to clinical data and inferences about the underlying pathology
   based on histopathological examination. Animal models and in vitro
   experiments have provided evidence for a cell-autonomous and a
   non-cell-autonomous mechanism for the accumulation of neuropathology.
   Combining modern neuroimaging tools to identify distinct neural networks
   (connectomics) with target-specific positron emission tomography (PET)
   tracers is an emerging and vibrant field of research with the potential
   to examine the contributions of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous
   mechanisms to the spread of pathology. The evidence provided here
   suggests that both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes
   relate to the observed in vivo characteristics of protein pathology and
   neurodegeneration across the disease spectrum. We propose a synergistic
   model of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous accounts that
   integrates the most critical factors (i.e., protein strain, susceptible
   cell feature and connectome) contributing to the development of neuronal
   dysfunction and in turn produces the observed clinical phenotypes. We
   believe that a timely and longitudinal pursuit of such research programs
   will greatly advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving

   clinically evaluated with 3 scales for stroke: NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT.
   As a first result, NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT correlated with Small World
   index as provided by the proportional increment/decrement of low (delta)
   and vice-versa of high (beta2 and gamma) EEG frequency bands.
   Furthermore, in line with the aim of the present study, we found a
   strong correlation between NIHSS at follow up and gamma Small World
   index in the acute poststroke period, giving SW index a significant
   weight of recovery prediction. This study aimed to investigate possible
   correlations between functional abnormalities of brain networks,
   measured by small world characteristics detected in resting state EEG
   source investigation, and early post-stroke clinical outcome in order to
   find a possible predictive index of functional recovery to address
   and/or correct the rehabilitation program.}},

   been seen during the course of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and could
   potentially be used as preclinical imaging biomarkers for the prediction
   of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. In this study, a
   deep learning framework utilizing Siamese neural networks trained on
   paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is used to harness the
   discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. The method
   uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric features
   of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel
   trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across
   datasets and populations. By working with the low-dimensional features,
   Siamese networks were shown to yield comparable performance to studies
   that utilize whole-brain MR images, with the advantage of reduced
   complexity and computational time, while preserving the biological
   information density. Experimental results also show that Siamese
   networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding the
   asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods
   that do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, with no
   effective treatment currently available. However, targeting the aging
   mechanism may improve outcomes and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system
   alteration could have implications for treatment of cognitive decline in
   old age. We studied the effects of the GABA system on brain activity in
   aged APP and PS1 transgenic mice. Low dose (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) GABA(A)
   agonist muscimol and antagonist bicuculline were administered for
   moderate system activation and inhibition, respectively. EEGs from the
   hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were recorded under
   spontaneous state and during Y-maze performance. Basally, AD mice
   exhibited increased spontaneous EEG delta (2-4 Hz) and decreased
   spontaneous EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the Hip, and decreased
   Y-maze EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity in the PFC. Interestingly, GABA(A)
   activation and inhibition in AD mice reduced EEG delta activity and
   increased EEG theta activity in the PFC, and behaviorally improved
   spatial recognition memory during Y-maze testing. Decreased spontaneous
   EEG delta activity was also observed in the PFC. Specifically, GABA(A)
   activation primarily affected low frequency EEG (2-12 Hz) activity in
   the PFC, whereas inhibition affected EEG activity across many
   frequencies in the PFC and Hip. These data provide evidence for slower
   brain activity in AD mice. Importantly, improved spatial memory after
   GABA(A) activation and inhibition may be explained by brain rhythm
   recovery in certain regions. Our study highlights the potential clinical
   use of GABA(A) drugs to improve cognitive disorders and restore neural
   network activity in AD.}},

   diseases diagnosis process is accomplished by analysing the magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scans using deep learning and is followed by an
   activity monitoring framework to monitor the subjects' activities of
   daily living using body worn inertial sensors. The activity monitoring
   provides an assistive framework in daily life activities and evaluates
   vulnerability of the patients based on the activity level. The AD
   diagnosis results show up to 82\% improvement in comparison to
   well-known existing techniques. Moreover, above 95\% accuracy is
   achieved to classify the activities of daily living which is quite
   encouraging in terms of monitoring the activity profile of the subject.

Abstract = {{The human brain can be inherently modeled as a brain network, where
   nodes denote billions of neurons and edges denote massive connections
   between neurons. Analysis on functional brain networks provides powerful
   abilities to discover potential mechanisms of human brain, and to aid
   brain disease detection, such as AD (Alzheimer's disease). Effective
   discrimination of patients of AD and MCI (mild cognitive impairment)
   from NC (normal control) is important for the early diagnosis of AD.
   Therefore, this paper explores the problem of brain network
   classification for AD detection. Two deep learning methods of functional
   brain network classification are designed. The convolutional learning
   method learns the deep regional-connectivity features, while the
   recurrent learning method learns the deep adjacent positional features.
   The ELM (extreme learning machine)-boosted structure is also implemented
   to further improve the learning ability. Extensive experiments are
   conducted to evaluate and compare the AUC (area under curve), accuracy,
   recall, and training time of the proposed methods on a real-world
   dataset. Results indicate that (1) the proposed methods which learn deep
   features directly from brain networks outperform shallow learning
   methods and (2) models with the ELM-boosted structure achieve a higher
   performance. This paper explores the brain networks learning with deep
   features and ELM. The results demonstrate that the proposed methods
   provide a satisfactory learning ability in the application of AD
   detection.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated
   with different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.
   Methods Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish
   prospective population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103).
   Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at
   baseline (1991-1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from
   national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical
   records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330),
   beta-amyloid(42) and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),
   and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral
   microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009-2015).
   Results During 20 years of follow-up, 462 individuals developed dementia
   (mean age at baseline = 57.5 +/- 5.9 years, 58\% women). Higher IMT in
   midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause
   dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) =
   1.03-1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 {[}95\% CI =
   1.10-1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95
   {[}95\% CI = 0.77-1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular
   dementia when assessed as a 3-graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 {[}95\%
   CI = 1.07-3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 +/- 4.6
   years at baseline, 60\% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated
   with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio {[}OR] =
   1.47 {[}95\% CI = 1.05-2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD
   biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 {[}95\% CI = 0.87-1.90] for A beta(42)
   and 1.35 {[}95\% CI = 0.86-2.13] for A beta(42)/p-tau). Carotid plaques
   revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain
   pathologies. Interpretation Our findings support an association between

Abstract = {{Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success

   imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction

   limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep
   leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data
   analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not
   only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain
   regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic
   variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to
   the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with
   diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel method for magnetic resonance imaging

   diagnosis that systematically integrates voxel-based, region-based, and
   patch-based approaches into a unified framework. Specifically, we
   parcellate the brain into predefined regions based on anatomical
   knowledge (i.e., templates) and derive complex nonlinear relationships
   among voxels, whose intensities denote volumetric measurements, within
   each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or rectangular
   shapes, we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical
   patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each
   region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a ``regional
   abnormality representation.{''} We then make a final clinical decision
   by integrating the regional abnormality representations over the entire
   brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations
   allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a
   subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing these observations in
   the brain space. On the baseline MRI dataset from the Alzheimer's

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been proposed as a source of
   information for automatic prediction of individual diagnosis in
   schizophrenia. Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities
   is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy.
   Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample
   of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI
   session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back,
   and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of
   low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted
   global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal
   classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were
   applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based
   on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we
   quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps
   (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added
   accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included
   post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step
   sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through
   one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four
   unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back
   maps (80\% on average) achieving a maximum of 84\% with the Lasso.
   Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean
   redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0-1 range), indicating that each brain map
   contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal
   accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87\%) followed
   by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85\%
   accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the
   best unimodal classifier (84\%). From these results, we conclude that
   from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best
   unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point
   to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal
   integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.}},

Abstract = {{Motor imagery is considered as an ideal window to observe neural
   processes of action representations. Behavioral evidence has indicated
   an alteration of motor imagery in amnestic mild cognitive impairment
   (aMCI). However, it still remains unclear on the altered
   neurophysiological processing mechanism of motor imagery and whether
   this mechanism links the abnormal biological basis of motor imagery with
   impaired cognition in aMCI. This study was to investigate the altered
   neurophysiological processing mechanism of motor imagery and to examine
   the relationships between this knowledge and the altered structural
   basis of motor imagery with impaired cognition in aMCI. A hand mental
   rotation paradigm was used to manipulate the processing of motor imagery
   while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded and gray
   matter (GM) voxel-based morphometry was performed in 20 aMCI and 29
   healthy controls. Compared with controls, aMCI exhibited lower ERP
   amplitudes in parietal cortex and higher ERP amplitudes in frontal
   cortex during motor imagery. In addition, aMCI showed reduced GM volumes
   in cerebellum posterior lobe, insula and hippocampus/parahippocampal
   gyrus, and increased GM volumes in middle cingulate gyrus and superior
   frontal gyrus. Most importantly, increased ERP amplitude significantly
   mediated the association between increased GM and cognition. This study
   provided a novel evidence for the relationships between the
   electrophysiological processing mechanism and structural basis of motor
   imagery with impaired cognition in aMCI. It suggests that improving
   neural activity by stimulating the frontal lobe can potentially
   contribute to acquire motor imagery skills for neurological

Abstract = {{Brain connectivity measures represent candidate biomarkers of neuronal
   dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases. Previous findings suggest
   that the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and its
   variants (i.e., frontal and temporo-limbic) may be related to the
   vulnerability of distinct functional connectivity networks. In this
   study, 82 bvFTD patients were included, and two patient groups were
   identified as frontal and temporo-limbic bvFTD variants. Two advanced
   multivariate analytical approaches were applied to FDG-PET data, i.e.,
   sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) method and seed-based
   interregional correlation analysis (IRCA). These advanced methods
   allowed the assessment of (i) the whole-brain metabolic connectivity,
   without any a priori assumption, and (ii) the main brain resting-state
   networks of crucial relevance for cognitive and behavioural functions.
   In the whole bvFTD group, we found dysfunctional connectivity patterns
   in frontal and limbic regions and in all major brain resting-state
   networks as compared to healthy controls (HC N = 82). In the two bvFTD
   variants, SICE and IRCA analyses identified variant-specific
   reconfigurations of whole-brain connectivity and resting-state networks.
   Specifically, the frontal bvFTD variant was characterised by metabolic
   connectivity alterations in orbitofrontal regions and anterior
   resting-state networks, while the temporo-limbic bvFTD variant was
   characterised by connectivity alterations in the limbic and salience
   networks. These results highlight different neural vulnerabilities in
   the two bvFTD variants, as shown by the dysfunctional connectivity
   patterns, with relevance for the different neuropsychological profiles.
   This new evidence provides further insight in the variability of bvFTD
   and may contribute to a more accurate classification of these patients.

Abstract = {{Patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) have a considerably high
   risk of developing dementia, especially for those with mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI). The investigation of the microstructural change of
   white matter (WM) between T2DM with amnesic MCI (T2DM-aMCI) and T2DM
   with normal cognition (T2DM-NC) and their relationships to cognitive
   performances can help to understand the brain variations in T2DM-related
   amnesic cognitive impairment. In the current study, 36 T2DM-aMCI
   patients, 40 T2DM-NC patients, and 40 healthy control (HC) individuals
   underwent diffusion tensor image and T1-weighted MRI scans and
   comprehensive cognition assessments. All of these cognitive functions
   exhibited intergroup ranking differences in patients. The T2DM-NC
   patients and HC individuals did not reveal any significant differences
   in WM integrity. The T2DM-aMCI patients showed disrupted integrity in
   multiple WM tracts compared with HC and T2DM-NC. Specifically, the
   damaged WM integrity of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
   and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus exhibited significant
   correlations with episodic memory and attention function impairment in
   T2DM patients. Furthermore, cognitive impairment-related WM
   microstructural damage was associated with the degeneration of cortex
   connected to the affected WM tract. These findings indicate that
   degeneration exists extensively in WM tracts in T2DM-aMCI, whereas no
   brain WM damage is evident in T2DM-NC.}},

Title = {{Quantifying deep grey matter atrophy using automated segmentation
   approaches: A systematic review of structural MRI studies}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{201}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{The deep grey matter (DGM) nuclei of the brain play a crucial role in
   learning, behaviour, cognition, movement and memory. Although automated
   segmentation strategies can provide insight into the impact of multiple
   neurological conditions affecting these structures, such as Multiple
   Sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   Parkinson's disease (PD) and Cerebral Palsy (CP), there are a number of
   technical challenges limiting an accurate automated segmentation of the
   DGM. Namely, the insufficient contrast of T1 sequences to completely
   identify the boundaries of these structures, as well as the presence of
   iso-intense white matter lesions or extensive tissue loss caused by
   brain injury. Therefore in this systematic review, 269 eligible studies
   were analysed and compared to determine the optimal approaches for
   addressing these technical challenges. The automated approaches used
   among the reviewed studies fall into three broad categories, atlas-based
   approaches focusing on the accurate alignment of atlas priors,
   algorithmic approaches which utilise intensity information to a greater
   extent, and learning-based approaches that require an annotated training
   set. Studies that utilise freely available software packages such as
   FIRST, FreeSurfer and LesionTOADS were also eligible, and their
   performance compared. Overall, deep learning approaches achieved the
   best overall performance, however these strategies are currently
   hampered by the lack of large-scale annotated data. Improving model
   generalisability to new datasets could be achieved in future studies
   with data augmentation and transfer learning. Multi-atlas approaches
   provided the second-best performance overall, and may be utilised to
   construct a ``silver standard{''} annotated training set for deep
   learning. To address the technical challenges, providing robustness to
   injury can be improved by using multiple channels, highly elastic
   diffeomorphic transformations such as LDDMM, and by following
   atlas-based approaches with an intensity driven refinement of the
   segmentation, which has been done with the Expectation Maximisation (EM)
   and level sets methods. Accounting for potential lesions should be
   achieved with a separate lesion segmentation approach, as in
   LesionTOADS. Finally, to address the issue of limited contrast, R2{*},
   T2{*} and QSM sequences could be used to better highlight the DGM due to
   its higher iron content. Future studies could look to additionally
   acquire these sequences by retaining the phase information from standard
   structural scans, or alternatively acquiring these sequences for only a
   training set, allowing models to learn the ``improved{''} segmentation
   from T1-sequences alone.}},

   in the Nucleus Accumbens}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{13}},
Month = {{OCT 24}},
Abstract = {{The Papez circuit, including the fornix white matter bundle, is a
   well-known neural network that is involved in multiple limbic functions
   such as memory and emotional expression. We previously reported a
   large-animal study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the fornix that
   found stimulation-induced hemodynamic responses in both the medial
   limbic and corticolimbic circuits on functional resonance imaging (fMRI)
   and evoked dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as
   measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The effects of DBS on
   the fornix are challenging to analyze, given its structural complexity
   and connection to multiple neuronal networks. In this study, we extend
   our earlier work to a rodent model wherein we characterize regional
   brain activity changes resulting from fornix stimulation using
   fludeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) micro positron emission tomography (PET) and
   monitor neurochemical changes using FSCV with pharmacological
   confirmation. Both global functional changes and local changes were
   measured in a rodent model of fornix DBS. Functional brain activity was
   measured by micro-PET, and the neurochemical changes in local areas were
   monitored by FSCV. Micro-PET images revealed increased glucose
   metabolism within the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits.
   Neurotransmitter efflux induced by fornix DBS was monitored at NAc by
   FSCV and identified by specific neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. We
   found a significant increase in the metabolic activity in several key
   regions of the medial limbic circuits and dopamine efflux in the NAc
   following fornix stimulation. These results suggest that electrical
   stimulation of the fornix modulates the activity of brain memory
   circuits, including the hippocampus and NAc within the dopaminergic
   pathway.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To investigate the multifactorial processes underlying
   cognitive aging based on the hypothesis that multiple causal pathways
   and mechanisms (amyloid, vascular, and resilience) influence
   longitudinal cognitive decline in each individual through worsening
   brain health. Methods We identified 1,230 elderly subjects (aged >= 50
   years) with an average of 4.9 years of clinical follow-up and with
   amyloid positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and
   structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from the population-based
   Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging markers of amyloid and
   brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and cortical
   thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and
   early to midlife intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal
   cognitive trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling
   longitudinal cognitive decline. Results All the pathways (amyloid,
   vascular, resilience) converged through their effects on cortical
   thinning and worsening cognition and together explained patterns in
   cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging process, sex
   differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) had
   significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity.
   Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity
   through systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity
   contributed to significant cortical thinning and subsequently
   longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a
   significant proportion of cognitive decline that accelerated with longer
   follow-up times, and its primary impact was through cortical thinning.
   Interpretation We developed an integrated framework to help explain the
   dynamic and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal
   pathways. Such an approach is important for both better comprehension of
   cognitive aging processes and will aid in the development of successful
   intervention strategies. ANN NEUROL 2019}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD), including its mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   phase that may or may not progress into the AD, is the most ordinary
   form of dementia. It is extremely important to correctly identify
   patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or
   may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this
   phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single
   modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent
   studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may
   provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases
   the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In
   this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to
   discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four
   different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
   (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was
   used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four
   modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects
   were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in
   MCIc {[}MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time
   period], and 36 in MCIs {[}MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24
   months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the
   healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of
   interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg
   toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two
   APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject
   using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass
   support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was
   applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have
   used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD)
   dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features
   into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method
   achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC)
   curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24\% for AD vs. HC,
   MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs
   subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other
   state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have
   improved the classification performance over the unimodal
   classification.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, several high-dimensional, accurate, and effective
   classification methods have been proposed for the automatic
   discrimination of the subject between Alzheimer's disease (AD) or its
   prodromal phase \{i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)\} and healthy
   control (HC) persons based on T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (sMRI). These methods emphasis only on using the individual
   feature from sMRI images for the classification of AD, MCI, and HC
   subjects and their achieved classification accuracy is low. However,
   latest multimodal studies have shown that combining multiple features
   from different sMRI analysis techniques can improve the classification
   accuracy for these types of subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel
   classification technique that precisely distinguishes individuals with
   AD, aAD (stable MCI, who had not converted to AD within a 36-month time
   period), and mAD (MCI caused by AD, who had converted to AD within a
   36-month time period) from HC individuals. The proposed method combines
   three different features extracted from structural MR (sMR) images using
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM), hippocampal volume (HV), and cortical and
   subcortical segmented region techniques. Three classification
   experiments were performed (AD vs. HC, aAD vs. mAD, and HC vs. mAD) with
   326 subjects (171 elderly controls and 81 AD, 35 aAD, and 39 mAD
   patients). For the development and validation of the proposed
   classification method, we acquired the sMR images from the dataset of
   the National Research Center for Dementia (NRCD). A five-fold
   crossvalidation technique was applied to find the optimal
   hyperparameters for the classifier, and the classification performance
   was compared by using three well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbor,
   support vector machine, and random forest. Overall, the proposed model
   with the SVM classifier achieved the best performance on the NRCD
   dataset. For the individual feature, the VBM technique provided the best
   results followed by the HV technique. However, the use of combined
   features improved the classification accuracy and predictive power for
   the early classification of AD compared to the use of individual
   features. The most stable and reliable classification results were
   achieved when combining all extracted features. Additionally, to analyze
   the efficiency of the proposed model, we used the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to compare the classification
   performance of the proposed model with those of several state-of-the-art
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder
   worldwide and is one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality
   in the aging population. There is a long preclinical period followed by
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Clinical diagnosis and the rate of
   decline is variable. Progression monitoring remains a challenge in AD,
   and it is imperative to create better tools to quantify this
   progression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for
   patient assessment. However, current approaches for analysis require
   strong a priori assumptions about regions of interest used and complex
   preprocessing pipelines including computationally expensive non-linear
   registrations and iterative surface deformations. These preprocessing
   steps are composed of many stacked processing layers. Any error or bias
   in an upstream layer will be propagated throughout the pipeline.
   Failures or biases in the non-linear subject registration and the
   subjective choice of atlases of specific regions are common in medical
   neuroimaging analysis and may hinder the translation of many approaches
   to the clinical practice. Here we propose a data-driven method based on
   an extension of a deep learning architecture, DeepSymNet, that
   identifies longitudinal changes without relying on prior brain regions
   of interest, an atlas, or non-linear registration steps. Our approach is
   trained end-to-end and learns how a patient's brain structure
   dynamically changes between two-time points directly from the raw
   voxels. We compare our approach with Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines
   and voxel-based methods using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model can identify AD progression with
   comparable results to existing Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines without
   the need of predefined regions of interest, non-rigid registration
   algorithms, or iterative surface deformation at a fraction of the
   processing time. When compared to other voxel-based methods which share
   some of the same benefits, our model showed a statistically significant
   performance improvement. Additionally, we show that our model can
   differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with MCI. The
   model's decision was investigated using the epsilon layer-wise
   propagation algorithm. We found that the predictions were driven by the
   pallidum, putamen, and the superior temporal gyrus. Our novel
   longitudinal based, deep learning approach has the potential to diagnose
   patients earlier and enable new computational tools to monitor
   neurodegeneration in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction
   The earliest changes in the brain due to Alzheimer's disease are
   associated with the neural networks related to memory function. We
   investigated changes in functional and structural connectivity among
   regions that support memory function in prodromal Alzheimer's disease,
   i.e., during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage.
   Methods
   Twenty-three older healthy controls and 25 adults with MCI underwent
   multimodal MRI scanning. Limbic white matter tracts the fornix,
   parahippocampal cingulum, retrosplenial cingulum, subgenual cingulum and
   uncinate fasciculus were reconstructed in ExploreDTl using constrained
   spherical deconvolution-based tractography. Using a network-of-interest
   approach, resting-state functional connectivity time-series correlations
   among sub-parcellations of the default mode and limbic networks, the
   hippocampus and the thalamus were calculated in Conn.
   Analysis
   Controlling for age, education, and gender between group linear
   regressions of five diffusion-weighted measures and of resting state
   connectivity measures were performed per hemisphere. FDR-corrections
   were performed within each class of measures. Correlations of
   within-network Fisher Z-transformed correlation coefficients and the
   mean diffusivity per tract were performed. Whole-brain graph theory
   measures of cluster coefficient and average path length were inspecting
   using the resting state data.
   Results \& conclusion
   MCI-related changes in white matter structure were found in the fornix,
   left parahippocampal cingulum, left retrosplenial cingulum and left
   subgenual cingulum. Functional connectivity decreases were observed in
   the MCI group within the DMN-a sub-network, between the hippocampus and
   sub-areas-a and -c of the DMN, between DMN-c and DMN-a, and, in the
   right hemisphere only between DMN-c and both the thalamus and limbic-a.

Abstract = {{The hippocampus has been recognized as an important biomarker for the
   diagnosis and assessment of neurological diseases. Convenient and
   accurate automated segmentation of the hippocampus facilitates the
   analysis of large-scale neuroimaging studies. This work describes a
   novel technique for hippocampus segmentation in magnetic resonance
   images, in which interactive neural network (Inter-Net) is based on 3D
   convolutional operations. Inter-Net achieves the interaction through two
   aspects: one is the compartments, which builds an exponential ensemble
   network that integrates numerous short networks together when forward
   propagation. The other is the pathways, which realizes inter-connection
   between feature extraction and restoration. In addition, a multi-target
   architecture is proposed by designing multiple objective functions in
   terms of evaluation index, information theory, and data distribution.
   The proposed architecture is validated in fivefold cross-validation on
   the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, where
   the mean Dice similarity indices of 0.919 (+/- 0.023) and precision of
   0.926 (+/- 0.032) for the hippocampus segmentation. The running time is
   approximately 42.1 s from reading the image to outputting the
   segmentation result in our computer configuration. We compare the
   experimental results of a variety of methods to prove the effectiveness
   of the Inter-Net and contrast integrated architectures with different
   objective functions to illustrate the robustness of the fusion. The
   proposed framework is general and can be easily extended to numerous
   tissue segmentation tasks while it is tailored for the hippocampus.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic segmentation of the hippocampus from 3D magnetic resonance
   imaging mostly relied on multi-atlas registration methods. In this work,
   we exploit recent advances in deep learning to design and implement a
   fully automatic segmentation method, offering both superior accuracy and

   Networks (CNNs) and incorporates distinct segmentation and error
   correction steps. Segmentation masks are produced by an ensemble of
   three independent models, operating with orthogonal slices of the input
   volume, while erroneous labels are subsequently corrected by a
   combination of Replace and Refine networks. We explore different
   training approaches and demonstrate how, in CNN-based segmentation,
   multiple datasets can be effectively combined through transfer learning
   techniques, allowing for improved segmentation quality. The proposed
   method was evaluated using two different public datasets and compared
   favorably to existing methodologies. In the EADC-ADNI HarP dataset, the

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis of dementia helps in finding suitable treatments that
   reduce or even prevent future cognitive dysfunction of patients. In this
   paper, we use a convolutional neural network to classify the brain
   positron-emission tomography (PET) image of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a normal control (NC). The purpose of
   this study is to investigate the influence of the data increment method
   and the number of data for the best accuracy in the convolutional neural
   network (CNN) by using the AlexNet algorithm with amyloid PET images.
   All subjects had an intravenous injection of 300 MBq of F-18-Florbetaben
   (F-18-FBB, Piramal Imaging, Berlin), and PET acquisition was started 90
   min after the radio-tracer injection. The image data were classified
   into NC, MCI and AD based on the findings of the neurologist. We
   performed data augmentation using a method such as flip, rotation, and
   GAN, in addition to pre-processing and data augmentation for AlexNet, in
   order to supplement a number of deficient data. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) learning was simulated using the Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient
   Descent (MSGD) algorithm, and the learning rate was 5e-5, and the epoch
   was 100. Using a CNN and the `AlexNet' architecture, we successfully
   classified F-18-FBB PET images of AD from NC where the accuracy of the
   test data on trained data reached 98.14\%. In this work, the CNN, which
   is a deep learning neural network architecture, was used in order to
   distinguish AD and MCI from the NC. Accuracy was 98.33\%, NC recall was
   99.16\%, MCI recall was 95.83\% and AD recall was 98.16\% after learning
   the data by using rotation and LR flip to increase the number of data.
   The accuracy was increased by 4.96\%, NC recall was increased by
   10.68\%, MCI recall was decreased by 0.23\%, and AD recall was increased
   by 9.65\% after learning the data by using DCGAN to increase the number
   of data to 4020. Accuracy and recall were improved when data were
   learned through data augmentation by rotation and by left and right
   reversal. However, the effect of learning data by increasing the data by
   using up-down reversal and data augmentation through DCGAN was almost
   insignificant.}},

Abstract = {{Adequate medical images are often indispensable in contemporary deep
   learning-based medical imaging studies, although the acquisition of
   certain image modalities may be limited due to several issues including
   high costs and patients issues. However, thanks to recent advances in
   deep learning techniques, the above tough problem can be substantially
   alleviated by medical images synthesis, by which various modalities
   including T1/T2/DTI MRI images, PET images, cardiac ultrasound images,
   retinal images, and so on, have already been synthesized. Unfortunately,
   the arterial spin labeling (ASL) image, which is an important fMRI
   indicator in dementia diseases diagnosis nowadays, has never been
   comprehensively investigated for the synthesis purpose yet. In this
   paper, ASL images have been successfully synthesized from structural
   magnetic resonance images for the first time. Technically, a novel
   unbalanced deep discriminant learning-based model equipped with new
   ResNet sub-structures is proposed to realize the synthesis of ASL images
   from structural magnetic resonance images. The extensive experiments
   have been conducted. Comprehensive statistical analyses reveal that: 1)
   this newly introduced model is capable to synthesize ASL images that are
   similar towards real ones acquired by actual scanning; 2) synthesized
   ASL images obtained by the new model have demonstrated outstanding
   performance when undergoing rigorous tests of region-based and
   voxel-based corrections of partial volume effects, which are essential
   in ASL images processing; and 3) it is also promising that the diagnosis
   performance of dementia diseases can be significantly improved with the
   help of synthesized ASL images obtained by the new model, based on a
   multi-modal MRI dataset containing 355 demented patients in this paper.}},

Abstract = {{The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the
   tedious questionnaire and prolonged tests, which require involvement of
   the patient, his/her family, and the clinician. Ultimately, the success
   of subjective evaluation depends on the expertise of the clinician. To
   eradicate this subjectivity, the present work proposes a method to
   automate the diagnosis of AD. The proposed method represents complex
   brain structure of the subject (captured by MRI, a safe and non-invasive
   medical imaging modality) in terms of quantifiable features and then
   performs classification of normal and AD subjects. It does so in three
   phases: (1) MRI volume is normalized and the gray matter, which is the
   most affected tissue in AD is extracted from the regions of interest.
   (2) Surfacelet transform, a 3D multi-resolution transform that captures
   intricate directional details, is applied on the volume to extract
   features. The features are then reduced by selecting relevant and
   non-redundant features using a combination of Fisher discriminant ratio,
   and minimum redundancy and maximum relevance feature selection methods.
   (3) Based on these features, AD patients and normal subjects are
   classified using support vector machine classifier with 10 runs of 10
   fold cross-validation. The performance of the method was computed using
   three measures (sensitivity, specificity, classification accuracy) on
   three datasets, constructed from the publically available database. It
   achieved 78.04\%, 98.00\% and 84.37\% classification accuracies on the
   three datasets respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is
   validated by comparing it with other existing methods under identical
   experimental settings using the above three performance measures as well
   as receiver operating characteristic curves, ranking and statistical
   tests. Overall, it significantly outperformed the existing methods. It
   indicates that the proposed method has the potential to assist
   clinicians in the decision making for the diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and
   progressive forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), can affect the brainstem
   and are associated with atrophy that can be visualized by MRI.
   Anatomically accurate, large-scale assessments of brainstem atrophy are
   challenging due to lack of automated, accurate segmentation methods. We
   present a novel method for brainstem volumetry using a fully-automated
   segmentation approach based on multi-dimensional gated recurrent units
   (MD-GRU), a deep learning based semantic segmentation approach employing
   a convolutional adaptation of gated recurrent units. The neural network
   was trained on 67 3D-high resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from MS
   patients and healthy controls (HC) and refined using segmentations of 20
   independent MS patients' scans. Reproducibility was assessed in MR
   test-retest experiments in 33 HC. Accuracy and robustness were examined
   by Dice scores comparing MD-GRU to FreeSurfer and manual brainstem
   segmentations in independent MS and AD datasets. The mean \%-change/SD
   between test-retest brainstem volumes were 0.45\%/0.005 (MD-GRU),
   0.95\%/0.009 (FreeSurfer), 0.86\%/0.007 (manually edited segmentations).
   Comparing MD-GRU to manually edited segmentations the mean Dice
   scores/SD were: 0.97/0.005 (brainstem), 0.95/0.013 (mesencephalon),
   0.98/0.006 (pons), 0.95/0.015 (medulla oblongata). Compared to the
   manual gold standard, MD-GRU brainstem segmentations were more accurate
   than FreeSurfer segmentations (p < .001). In the multi-centric acquired
   AD data, the mean Dice score/SD for the MD-GRU-manual segmentation
   comparison was 0.97/0.006. The fully automated brainstem segmentation
   method MD-GRU provides accurate, highly reproducible, and robust
   segmentations in HC and patients with MS and AD in 200 s/scan on an
   Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU and shows potential for application in large
   and longitudinal datasets.}},

Abstract = {{With the advent of convolutional neural networks (CNN), supervised
   learning methods are increasingly being used for whole brain
   segmentation. However, a large, manually annotated training dataset of
   labeled brain images required to train such supervised methods is
   frequently difficult to obtain or create. In addition, existing training
   datasets are generally acquired with a homogeneous magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) acquisition protocol. CNNs trained on such datasets are
   unable to generalize on test data with different acquisition protocols.
   Modern neuroimaging studies and clinical trials are necessarily
   multi-center initiatives with a wide variety of acquisition protocols.
   Despite stringent protocol harmonization practices, it is very difficult
   to standardize the gamut of MRI imaging parameters across scanners,
   field strengths, receive coils etc., that affect image contrast. In this
   paper we propose a CNN-based segmentation algorithm that, in addition to
   being highly accurate and fast, is also resilient to variation in the
   input acquisition. Our approach relies on building approximate forward
   models of pulse sequences that produce a typical test image. For a given
   pulse sequence, we use its forward model to generate plausible,
   synthetic training examples that appear as if they were acquired in a
   scanner with that pulse sequence. Sampling over a wide variety of pulse
   sequences results in a wide variety of augmented training examples that
   help build an image contrast invariant model. Our method trains a single
   CNN that can segment input MRI images with acquisition parameters as
   disparate as T-1-weighted and T-2-weighted contrasts with only
   T-1-weighted training data. The segmentations generated are highly
   accurate with state-of-the-art results (overall Dice overlap = 0.94),
   with a fast run time (approximate to 45 s), and consistent across a wide
   range of acquisition protocols.}},

   patients recruited in the ongoing longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative study were included in this analysis. Patients
   were grouped into 2 classes: (1) stable mild cognitive impairment (n =

   is composed of 4 steps: (1) image preprocessing: normalization and
   smoothing; (2) identification of regions of interest (ROIs); (3) feature
   learning using deep neural networks; and (4) classification by support

Abstract = {{F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) enables

   These images have shown great promise in revealing the altered

   progressive, and leads to structural and functional alterations that lie
   on a continuum. There is a need to quantify the altered metabolism
   patterns that exist on a continuum into a simple measure. This work
   proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections
   that generates a probability score useful for interpreting the FDG-PET
   images along the continuum of AD. This network is trained and tested on
   images of stable normal control and stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's
   type (sDAT) subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.976 via repeated fivefold
   cross-validation. An independent test set consisting of images in

   the generalization performance of the network. Classification
   performance of 0.811 AUC is achieved in the task of predicting
   conversion of mild cognitive impairment to DAT for conversion time of

Journal = {{SCIENTIFIC REPORTS}},
Year = {{2019}},

Month = {{SEP 4}},
Abstract = {{Temporal fluctuation of neural activity in the brain has an important
   function in optimal information processing. Spontaneous activity is a
   source of such fluctuation. The distribution of excitatory postsynaptic
   potentials (EPSPs) between cortical pyramidal neurons can follow a
   log-normal distribution. Recent studies have shown that networks
   connected by weak synapses exhibit characteristics of a random network,
   whereas networks connected by strong synapses have small-world
   characteristics of small path lengths and large cluster coefficients. To
   investigate the relationship between temporal complexity spontaneous
   activity and structural network duality in synaptic connections, we
   executed a simulation study using the leaky integrate-and-fire spiking
   neural network with log-normal synaptic weight distribution for the
   EPSPs and duality of synaptic connectivity, depending on synaptic
   weight. We conducted multiscale entropy analysis of the temporal spiking
   activity. Our simulation demonstrated that, when strong synaptic
   connections approach a smallworld network, specific spiking patterns
   arise during irregular spatio-temporal spiking activity, and the
   complexity at the large temporal scale (i.e., slow frequency) is
   enhanced. Moreover, we confirmed through a surrogate data analysis that
   slow temporal dynamics reflect a deterministic process in the spiking
   neural networks. This modelling approach may improve the understanding
   of the spatio-temporal complex neural activity in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Precision medicine promises better healthcare delivery by improving
   clinical practice. Using evidence-based substratification of patients,
   the objective is to achieve better prognosis, diagnosis, and treatment
   that will transform existing clinical pathways toward optimizing care
   for the specific needs of each patient. The wealth of today's healthcare
   data, often characterized as big data, provides invaluable resources
   toward new knowledge discovery that has the potential to advance
   precision medicine. The latter requires interdisciplinary efforts that
   will capitalize the information, know-how, and medical data of newly
   formed groups fusing different backgrounds and expertise. The objective
   of this paper is to provide insights with respect to the
   state-of-the-art research in precision medicine. More specifically, our
   goal is to highlight the fundamental challenges in emerging fields of
   radiomics and radiogenomics by reviewing the case studies of Cancer and
   Alzheimer's disease, describe the computational challenges from a big
   data analytics perspective, and discuss standardization and open data
   initiatives that will facilitate the adoption of precision medicine
   methods and practices.}},

Abstract = {{Hippocampus is one of the first involved regions in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) andmild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD.
   Hippocampal atrophy is a validated, easily accessible, and widely used
   biomarker for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods compute the shape
   and volume features for hippocampus analysis using structural magnetic
   resonance images (MRI). However, the regions adjacent to hippocampus may
   be relevant to AD, and the visual features of the hippocampal region are
   important for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we have proposed a new
   hippocampus analysis method to combine the global and local features of
   hippocampus by three-dimensional densely connected convolutional
   networks and shape analysis for AD diagnosis. The proposed method can
   make use of the local visual and global shape features to enhance the
   classification. Tissue segmentation and nonlinear registration are not
   required in the proposed method. Our method is evaluated with the
   T1-weighted structural MRIs from 811 subjects including 192 AD, 396 MCI
   (231 stable MCI and 165 progressive MCI), and 223 normal control in
   Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database. Experimental
   results show the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of
   92.29\% and area under the ROC curve of 96.95\% for AD diagnosis.
   Results comparison demonstrates the proposed method performs better than
   other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with complex
   changes in eating behavior and metabolism, which potentially affect
   disease pathogenesis and survival. It is currently not known if body
   composition changes and changes in fat deposition also exist in FTD, the
   relationship of these changes in eating behavior and appetite, and
   whether these changes are centrally mediated. Methods Body composition
   was measured in 28 people with behavioral-variant frontotemporal
   dementia (bvFTD), 16 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 healthy
   controls, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Changes in body
   composition were correlated to brain grey matter atrophy using
   voxel-based morphometry on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.
   Results Behavioral-variant FTD was characterized by changes in body
   composition, with increased total fat mass, visceral adipose tissue area
   (VAT area), and android: gynoid ratio compared to control and AD
   participants (all P values < 0.05). Changes in body composition
   correlated to abnormal eating behavior and behavioral change (P < 0.01)
   and functional decline (P < 0.01). Changes in body composition also
   correlated to grey matter atrophy involving a distributed neural network
   that included the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, insula,
   cingulate, and cerebellum - structures known to be central to autonomic
   control - as well as the thalamus, putamen, accumbens, and caudate,
   which are involved in reward processing. Conclusions Changes in body
   composition and fat deposition extend the clinical phenomenology in
   bvFTD beyond cognition and behavior, with changes associated with
   changes in reward and autonomic processing suggesting that these
   deficits may be central in FTD}},

Abstract = {{Background. Alzheimer's is a disease for which there is no cure.
   Diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) early facilitates family planning
   and cost control. The purpose of this study is to predict the presence
   of AD using socio-demographic, clinical, and magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) data. Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce
   costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery methods also
   reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies
   (OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted
   machine (GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age,
   education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam
   (MMSE). A residual network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) predicted the
   clinical dementia rating (CDR) presence and severity from MRI's
   (multi-class classification). The GBM achieved a mean 91.3\% prediction
   accuracy (10-fold stratified cross validation) for dichotomous CDR using
   socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most important
   feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80\%
   training set resulted in 98.99\% three class prediction accuracy on 4139
   images (20\% validation set) at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class
   predication accuracy on the training set (99.34\%). Machine learning
   methods classify AD with high accuracy. GBM models may help provide
   initial detection based on non-imagery analysis, while ResNet-50 network
   models might help identify AD patients automatically prior to provider
   review.}},

Month = {{SEP}},
Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary stage condition
   between healthy people and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and other
   dementias. AD is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative
   disorder, which is a significant threat to people, age 65 and older.
   Although MCI does not always lead to AD, an early diagnosis at the stage
   of MCI can be very helpful in identifying people who are at risk of AD.
   Moreover, the early diagnosis of MCI can lead to more effective
   treatment, or at least, significantly delay the disease's progress, and
   can lead to social and financial benefits. Magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), which has become a significant tool for the diagnosis of MCI and
   AD, can provide neuropsychological data for analyzing the variance in
   brain structure and function. MCI is divided into early and late MCI
   (EMCI and LMCI) and sadly, there is no clear differentiation between the
   brain structure of healthy people and MCI patients, especially in the
   EMCI stage. This paper aims to use a deep learning approach, which is
   one of the most powerful branches of machine learning, to discriminate
   between healthy people and the two types of MCI groups based on MRI
   results. The convolutional neural network (CNN) with an efficient
   architecture was used to extract high-quality features from MRIs to
   classify people into healthy, EMCI, or LMCI groups. The MRIs of 600
   individuals used in this study included 200 control normal (CN) people,
   200 EMCI patients, and 200 LMCI patients. This study randomly selected
   70 percent of the data to train our model and 30 percent for the test
   set. The results showed the best overall classification between CN and
   LMCI groups in the sagittal view with an accuracy of 94.54 percent. In
   addition, 93.96 percent and 93.00 percent accuracy were reached for the
   pairs of EMCI/LMCI and CN/EMCI, respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain needs an impeccable analysis
   to investigate all its structure and pattern. This analysis may be a
   sharp visual analysis by an experienced medical professional or by a
   computer aided diagnosis system that can help to predict, what may be
   the recent condition. Similarly, on the basis of various information and
   technique, a system can be designed to detect whether a patient is prone
   to Alzheimer's disease or not. And this task of detection of
   abnormalities at an initial stage from brain MRI is a major challenge in
   the field of neurosciences. The main idea behind our research is to
   utilize the deep layers feature extraction benefited from deep neural
   network architecture, without extensive hardware resource training, and
   classifying the image on a basis of simple machine-learning algorithm
   with selected best features in order to reduce work load, classification
   error and hardware utilization time. We have utilized convolution neural
   network (CNN) layer using similar architecture like that of Alexnet with
   some parametric change, for the automatic extraction of features of
   images obtained from slice extraction of whole brain MRI whereas 13
   manual features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix were also
   extracted to test the impact of this features on ranking. If we had only
   classified using CNN network, the misclassification rate was much
   higher. So, feature selection is achieved with feature ranking
   algorithms like Mutinffs, ReliefF, Laplacian and UDFS and so on and also
   tested with different machine-learning techniques like Support Vector
   Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Subspace Ensemble under different
   testing condition. The performance of the result is satisfactory with
   classification accuracy around 98\% to 99\% with 7:3 ratio of random
   holdout partition of training to testing image sets and also with
   fivefolds of cross-validation on the same set using a standardized

Abstract = {{Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown
   outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying
   intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the
   domain of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early
   detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has
   recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in
   neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal
   neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep
   learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification
   of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to
   identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and
   July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by
   algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16
   studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep
   learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only
   deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine
   learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature
   selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD classification and
   83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as
   convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN),
   that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection
   have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\%
   for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was
   obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were
   combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance
   and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using
   multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is
   still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid
   data types, such as-omics data, increasing transparency with explainable
   approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and
   mechanisms.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To determine whether amyloid imaging with the positron
   emission tomography (PET) agent Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) can detect
   vascular beta-amyloid (A beta) in the essentially pure form of cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy associated with the Dutch-type hereditary cerebral
   amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) mutation. Methods PiB retention in a cortical
   composite of frontal, lateral, and retrosplenial regions (FLR) was
   measured by PiB-PET in 19 D-CAA mutation carriers (M+; 13 without
   neurologic symptoms, 6 with prior lobar intracerebral hemorrhage) and 17
   mutation noncarriers (M-). Progression of PiB retention was analyzed in
   a subset of 18 serially imaged individuals (10 asymptomatic M+, 8 M-).
   We also analyzed associations between PiB retention and cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF) A beta concentrations in 17 M+ and 11 M- participants who
   underwent lumbar puncture and compared the findings to PiB-PET and CSF A
   beta in 37 autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation
   carriers. Results D-CAA M+ showed greater age-dependent FLR PiB
   retention (p < 0.001) than M-, and serially imaged asymptomatic M+
   demonstrated greater longitudinal increases (p = 0.004). Among M+,
   greater FLR PiB retention associated with reduced CSF concentrations of
   A beta 40 (r = -0.55, p = 0.021) but not A beta 42 (r = 0.01, p =
   0.991). Despite comparably low CSF A beta 40 and A beta 42, PiB
   retention was substantially less in D-CAA than ADAD (p < 0.001).
   Interpretation Increased PiB retention in D-CAA and correlation with
   reduced CSF A beta 40 suggest this compound labels vascular amyloid,
   although to a lesser degree than amyloid deposits in ADAD. Progression
   in PiB signal over time suggests amyloid PET as a potential biomarker in

Abstract = {{Late-life depression (LLD) is an affective disorder that is highly
   prevalent among older people. Cognitive reserve (CR) refers to an active
   process that facilitates the flexibility and efficiency of the neural
   networks to compensate for impairments that emerge in consequence of
   brain pathology. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study
   investigated whether and how CR affects emotional regulation, level of
   depression severity and neural activity associated with affective
   control during emotional Stroop (eStroop) task. Altogether, 90 older
   people participated in this study, 50 of whom suffered from LLD. We used
   years of education and verbal fluency capacity as proxies for CR.
   Clinical participants with relatively higher CR presented with milder
   degrees of depression, better eStroop performance and stronger neural
   activity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) involved with exercising
   affective control. Results of the mediation analysis indicated that both
   education and verbal fluency significantly mediated the association
   between the depression severity and MEG activity. These results suggest
   a negative association between CR and age-related clinical symptoms of
   emotional dysregulation. Our neurobehavioral findings provide supportive
   evidence that CR implies efficiency of top-down emotional regulation and
   operates as a protective factor against emotional and cognitive
   vulnerability in the aging brain.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in older adults
   and represents a high-risk group for progression to Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). Medication trials in MCI have generally failed, but new
   discoveries with brain plasticity in ageing have led to the study of
   cognitive training as a potential treatment to improve cognitive
   abilities. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) involves computerised
   cognitive exercises that target specific cognitive abilities and neural
   networks to potentially improve cognitive functioning through
   neuroplasticity.
   Methods and analysis In a two-site study (New York State Psychiatric
   Institute/Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical
   Center), we will randomise 100 patients with MCI (Wechsler Memory
   Scale-III Logical Memory II score 0-11; Folstein Mini Mental State
   Examination >= 23) to home-based CCT (suite of exercises: memory,
   matching, spatial recognition, processing speed) or a home-based active
   control condition (computerised crossword puzzle training (CPT)) with 12
   weeks of intensive training followed by regular booster sessions up to
   78 weeks. All patients will receive standard neuropsychological and
   functional assessments in clinic as well as structural/functional brain
   MRI scans at study entry and endpoint. We will test if CCT, versus CPT,
   leads to improved cognitive functioning, transfers to functional ability
   and tasks of everyday life and impacts hippocampal volume changes and
   changes in the default mode network of the brain measured by
   resting-state functional MRI.
   Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted following ethics
   approval and written informed consent will be obtained from all
   subjects. Study results will be disseminated via publication,
   clinicaltrials.gov, media and conference presentations. This will be the
   first controlled long-term trial to evaluate the effects of home-based
   CCT versus computerised CPT on cognitive abilities and functional
   measures and neural outcomes as determined by MRI indices in patients
   with MCI. Positive results from trial may support further development of
   home-based CCT.

   91.13\%, 74.77\%, 81.12\%, and 81.78\% in identifying AD/healthy
   control, sMCI/pMCI, sMCI/AD, and pMCI/HC, respectively. The experimental

Abstract = {{Disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission plays a central role in

   At the systems level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the

   technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a double-blind, crossover
   design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic drug
   administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in
   a group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose
   scopolamine (0.2 mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and
   selectively decreased connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks.
   Both memory and connectivity effects were independent of beta-amyloid
   burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes within the Default and
   Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength of
   anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully
   statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance.
   These results provide experimental support for the importance of the
   Default and Salience networks to memory performance and suggest
   scopolamine-induced amnesia is underpinned by disrupted connectivity
   within and between these 2 networks. More broadly, these results support
   the potential utility of fcMRI as tool examine the systems-level
   pharmacology of psychoactive drugs.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: It is challenging at baseline to predict when and which
   individuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will
   ultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
   Methods: A deep learning method is developed and validated based on
   magnetic resonance imaging scans of 2146 subjects (803 for training and
   1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD dementia
   in a time-to-event analysis setting.
   Results: The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual
   subjects' progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762
   on 439 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects
   with follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: {[}24, 42, 54])
   and a concordance index of 0.781 on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and
   Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration
   from 18 to 54 months (quartiles: {[}18, 36, 54]). The predicted
   progression risk also clustered individual subjects into subgroups with
   significant differences in their progression time to AD dementia (P <
   .0002). Improved performance for predicting progression to AD dementia
   (concordance index = 0.864) was obtained when the deep learning-based
   progression risk was combined with baseline clinical measures.
   Discussion: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means for
   prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials
   with individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.

Title = {{Age Prediction Based on Brain MRI Image: A Survey}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{43}},
Number = {{8}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Human age prediction is an interesting and applicable issue in different
   fields. It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA
   methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images
   and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on
   images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques
   have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction
   problem. The implementations would be used in different fields,
   especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has
   attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in
   early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer,
   Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance
   Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain
   MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and
   accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of
   neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of
   it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age
   prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods,
   useful tools used in different research works and the estimation
   algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first
   the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based,
   surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML
   algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The
   modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get
   results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and
   statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related
   tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros
   and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed
   and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.}},

Title = {{Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation for Explaining Deep Neural Network
   Decisions in MRI-Based Alzheimer's Disease Classification}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{JUL 31}},
Abstract = {{Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many
   medical imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based
   on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the
   network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent,
   making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. In
   this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to
   visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI
   data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap
   in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of each voxel
   contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to
   susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation ({''}Which change
   in voxels would change the outcome most?{''}), the LRP method is able to
   directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification
   in the input space. In particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is
   very specific for individuals ({''}Why does this person have AD?{''})
   with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little relevance
   for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of relevance
   correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the
   latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per
   brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although these
   metrics produce very individual ``fingerprints{''} of relevance patterns
   for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal
   lobe including the hippocampus. After discussing several limitations
   such as sensitivity toward the underlying model and computation
   parameters, we conclude that LRP might have a high potential to assist
   clinicians in explaining neural network decisions for diagnosing AD (and
   potentially other diseases) based on structural MRI data.}},

Abstract = {{This paper addresses the issue of Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection
   from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRIs). Existing AD detection methods
   rely on global feature learning from the whole brain scans, while
   depending on the tissue types, AD related features in different tissue
   regions, e.g. grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal
   fluid (CSF), show different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a
   deep learning method for multi-scale feature learning based on segmented
   tissue areas. A novel deep 3D multi-scale convolutional network scheme
   is proposed to generate multi-resolution features for AD detection. The
   proposed scheme employs several parallel 3D multi-scale convolutional
   networks, each applying to individual tissue regions (GM, WM and CSF)
   followed by feature fusions. The proposed fusion is applied in two
   separate levels: the first level fusion is applied on different scales
   within the same tissue region, and the second level is on different
   tissue regions. To further reduce the dimensions of features and
   mitigate overfitting, a feature boosting and dimension reduction method,
   XGBoost, is utilized before the classification. The proposed deep
   learning scheme has been tested on a moderate open dataset of ADNI (1198
   scans from 337 subjects), with excellent test performance on randomly
   partitioned datasets (best 99.67\%, average 98.29\%), and good test
   performance on subject-separated partitioned datasets (best 94.74\%,
   average 89.51\%). Comparisons with state-of-the-art methods are also

Abstract = {{Background and Objective. In a previous study, we showed a new EEG
   processing methodology called Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map/Implicit
   Function As Squashing Time (MS-ROM/IFAST) performing an almost perfect
   distinction between computerized EEG of Italian children with autism
   spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing children. In this
   study, we assessed this system in distinguishing ASD subjects from
   children affected with other neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). Methods.
   At a psychiatric practice in Texas, 20 children diagnosed with ASD and
   20 children diagnosed with NPD were entered into the study. Continuous
   segments of artifact-free EEG data lasting 10 minutes were entered in
   MS-ROM/IFAST. From the new variables created by MS-ROM/IFAST, only 12
   has been selected according to a correlation criterion. The selected
   features represent the input on which supervised machine learning
   systems (MLS) acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall
   predictive capability in distinguishing ASD from other NPD cases ranged
   from 93\% to 97.5\%. The results were confirmed in further experiments
   in which Italian and US data have been combined. In this analysis, the
   best MLS reached 95.0\% global accuracy in 1 out of 3 classes
   distinction (ASD, NPD, controls). This study demonstrates the value of
   EEG processing with advanced MLS in the differential diagnosis between
   ASD and NPD cases. The results were not affected by age, ethnicity and
   technicalities of EEG acquisition, confirming the existence of a
   specific EEG signature in ASD cases. To further support these findings,
   it was decided to test the behavior of already trained neural networks
   on 10 Italian very young ASD children (25-37 months). In this test, 9
   out of 10 cases have been correctly recognized as ASD subjects in the
   best case. Conclusions. These results confirm the possibility of an
   early automatic autism detection based on standard EEG.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative dementia syndromes are characterized by spreading of
   pathological protein deposition along syndrome-specific neural networks.
   Structural and functional MRI measures can assess the integrity of these
   networks and have been proposed as biomarkers of disease progression for
   clinical trials. The relationship between in vivo imaging measures and
   pathological features, at the single subject level, remains largely
   unknown. Patient-specific maps of atrophy and seed-based intrinsic
   connectivity disruption, as compared to normal controls, were obtained
   for 27 patients subsequently diagnosed with progressive supranuclear
   palsy (n = 16, seven males, age at death 68.9 +/- 6.0 years,
   imaging-to-pathology interval = 670.2 +/- 425.1 days) or corticobasal
   degeneration (n = 11, two males, age at death 66.7 +/- 5.4 years,
   imaging-to-pathology interval = 696.2 +/- 482.2 days). A linear mixed
   effect model with crossed random effects was used to test regional and
   single-subject level associations between post-mortem regional measures
   of neurodegeneration and tau inclusion burden, on the one hand, and
   regional volume loss and seed-based intrinsic connectivity reduction, on
   the other. A significant association was found between tau inclusion
   burden and in vivo volume loss, at the regional level and independent of
   neurodegeneration severity, in both progressive supranuclear palsy {[}n
   = 340 regions; beta 0.036; 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.001, 0.072;
   P = 0.046] and corticobasal degeneration (n = 215 regions; beta 0.044;
   95\% CI: 0.009, 0.079; P = 0.013). We also found a significant
   association between post-mortem neurodegeneration and in vivo volume
   loss in both progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 340 regions; beta
   0.155; 95\% CI: 0.061, 0.248; P = 0.001) and corticobasal degeneration
   (n = 215 regions; beta 0.277; 95\% CI: 0.104, 0.450; P = 0.002). We
   found a significant association between regional neurodegeneration and
   intrinsic connectivity dysfunction in corticobasal degeneration (n = 215
   regions; beta 0.074; 95\% CI: 0.005, 0.143; P = 0.035), but no other
   associations between post-mortem measures of tauopathy and intrinsic

   suggest that in vivo structural imaging measures reflect independent
   contributions from neurodegeneration and tau burden in progressive
   supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Seed-based measures of

Abstract = {{Using a single imaging modality to diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD) or
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a challenging task.
   FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) is an
   important and effective modality used for that purpose. In this paper,
   we develop a novel method by using single modality (FDG-PET) but
   multilevel feature, which considers both region properties and
   connectivities between regions to classify AD or MCI from normal
   control. First, three levels of features are extracted: statistical,
   connectivity, and graph-based features. Then, the connectivity features
   are decomposed into three different sets of features according to a
   proposed similarity-driven ranking method, which can not only reduce the
   feature dimension but also increase the classifier's diversity. Last,
   after feeding the three levels of features to different classifiers, a
   new classifier selection strategy, maximum Mean squared Error (mMsE), is
   developed to select a pair of classifiers with high diversity. In order
   to do the majority voting, a decision-making scheme, a nested cross
   validation technique is applied to choose another classifier according
   to the accuracy. Experiments on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative database show that the proposed method outperforms most
   FDG-PET-based classification algorithms, especially for classifying
   progressive MCI (pMCI) from stable MCI (sMCI).}},

Abstract = {{Objective Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD).
   Under physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally
   enhance longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the
   ability of each polyamine metabolite to act as an age-related,
   diagnostic, and severity-associated PD biomarker. Methods Comprehensive
   metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n =
   45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in
   Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy,
   n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who
   were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion
   tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with
   disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H\&Y)
   and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III).
   Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine
   metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines. Results In
   Cohort A, N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetylputrescine levels were
   significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B,
   spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced
   in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore,
   N1,N8-diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and
   correlated with H\&Y, UPDRS-III, and axonal degeneration quantified by
   DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but
   was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine
   was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH-SY5Y cells. No
   significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated
   with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with
   controls. Interpretation Spermine synthesis and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine
   may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity-associated biomarkers

Abstract = {{Background The development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for
   Alzheimer disease is complicated by substantial clinical heterogeneity
   in prodromal stages. Many neuroimaging studies have focused on
   case-control classification and predicting conversion from mild
   cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease, but predicting scores from
   clinical assessments (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale
   or the Mini Mental State Examination) using MRI data has received less
   attention. Predicting clinical scores can be crucial in providing a
   nuanced prognosis and inferring symptomatic severity. Methods We
   predicted clinical scores at the individual level using a novel
   anatomically partitioned artificial neural network (APANN) model. The
   model combined input from 2 structural MRI measures relevant to the
   neurodegenerative patterns observed in Alzheimer disease: hippocampal
   segmentations and cortical thickness. We evaluated the performance of
   the APANN model with 10 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation in 3
   experiments, using cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI): ADNI1, ADNI2 and ADNI1 + 2. Results Pearson
   correlation and root mean square error between the actual and predicted
   scores on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADNI1: r = 0.60;
   ADNI2: r = 0.68; ADNI1 + 2: r = 0.63) and Mini Mental State Examination
   (ADNI1: r = 0.52; ADNI2: r = 0.55; ADNI1 + 2: r = 0.55) showed that
   APANN can accurately infer clinical severity from MRI data. Limitations
   To rigorously validate the model, we focused primarily on large
   cross-sectional baseline data sets with only proof-of-concept
   longitudinal results. Conclusion The APANN provides a highly robust and
   scalable framework for predicting clinical severity at the individual
   level using high-dimensional, multimodal neuroimaging data.}},

Abstract = {{The neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) has shown its effectiveness in recent years. In general,
   the multimodal neuroimaging-based CAD always outperforms the approaches
   based on a single modality. However, single-modal neuroimaging is more
   favored in clinical practice for diagnosis due to the limitations of
   imaging devices, especially in rural hospitals. Learning using
   privileged information (LUPI) is a new learning paradigm that adopts
   additional privileged information (PI) modality to help to train a more
   effective learning model during the training stage, but PI itself is not
   available in the testing stage. Since PI is generally related to the
   training samples, it is then transferred to the learned model. In this
   work, a LUPI-based CAD framework for AD is proposed. It can flexibly
   perform a classifier- or feature-level LUPI, in which the information is
   transferred from the additional PI modality to the diagnosis modality. A
   thorough comparison has been made among three classifier-level
   algorithms and five feature-level LUPI algorithms. The experimental
   results on the ADNI dataset show that all classifier-level and deep
   learning based feature-level LUPI algorithms can improve the performance

Abstract = {{White matter hyperintensities (WMH) appear as regions of abnormally high
   signal intensity on T2-weighted magnetic resonance image (MRI)
   sequences. In particular, WMH have been noteworthy in age-related
   neuroscience for being a crucial biomarker for all types of dementia and
   brain aging processes. The automatic WMH segmentation is challenging
   because of their variable intensity range, size and shape. U-Net tackles
   this problem through the dense prediction and has shown competitive
   performances not only on WMH segmentation/detection but also on varied
   image segmentation tasks. However, its network architecture is high
   complex. In this study, we propose the use of Saliency U-Net and
   Irregularity map (IAM) to decrease the U-Net architectural complexity
   without performance loss. We trained Saliency U-Net using both: a
   T2-FLAIR MRI sequence and its correspondent IAM. Since IAM guides
   locating image intensity irregularities, in which WMH are possibly
   included, in the MRI slice, Saliency U-Net performs better than the
   original U-Net trained only using T2-FLAIR. The best performance was
   achieved with fewer parameters and shorter training time. Moreover, the
   application of dilated convolution enhanced Saliency U-Net by
   recognizing the shape of large WMH more accurately through multi-context
   learning. This network named Dilated Saliency U-Net improved Dice
   coefficient score to 0.5588 which was the best score among our
   experimental models, and recorded a relatively good sensitivity of
   0.4747 with the shortest training time and the least number of
   parameters. In conclusion, based on our experimental results,
   incorporating IAM through Dilated Saliency U-Net resulted an appropriate

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{JUN 20}},
Abstract = {{The differentiation of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) using brain perfusion single photon emission tomography is
   important but is challenging because these conditions exhibit typical
   features. The cingulate island sign (CIS) is the most recently
   identified specific feature of DLB for a differential diagnosis. The
   current study aimed to examine the usefulness of deep-learningbased
   imaging classification for the diagnoses of DLB and AD. Furthermore, we
   investigated whether CIS was emphasized by a deep convolutional neural
   network (CNN) during differentiation. Brain perfusion single photon
   emission tomography images from 80 patients, each with DLB and AD, and
   80 individuals with normal cognition (NL) were used for training and 20
   each for final testing. The CNN was trained on brain surface perfusion
   images. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM) was applied
   to the CNN to visualize the features that was emphasized by the trained
   CNN. The binary classifications between DLB and NL, DLB and AD, and AD
   and NL were 93.1\%, 89.3\%, and 92.4\% accurate, respectively. The CIS
   ratios closely correlated with the output scores before softmax for
   DLB-AD discrimination (DLB/AD scores). The Grad-CAM highlighted CIS in
   the DLB discrimination. Visualization of learning process by guided
   Grad-CAM revealed that CIS became more focused by the CNN as the
   training progressed. The DLB/AD score was significantly associated with
   the three core features of DLB. Deep-learning-based imaging
   classification was useful for an objective and accurate differentiation
   of DLB from AD and for predicting clinical features of DLB. The CIS was
   identified as a specific feature during DLB classification. The
   visualization of specific features and learning processes could be
   critical in deep learning to discover new imaging features.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of the gamma
   oscillation function (40-130 Hz) to reduce Alzheimer's disease related
   pathology in a computer model of the hippocampal network dentate gyrus,
   CA3, and CA1 (DG-CA3-CA1) regions. Methods: Computer simulations were
   made for a pathological model in which Alzheimer's disease was simulated
   by synaptic degradation in the hippocampus. Pathology modeling was based
   on sequentially turning off the connections with entorhinal cortex layer
   2 (EC2) and the dentate gyrus on CA3 pyramidal neurons. Gamma induction
   modeling consisted of simulating the oscillation provided by the
   septo-hippocampal pathway with band frequencies from 40-130 Hz.
   Pathological models with and without gamma induction were compared with
   a control. Results: In the hippocampal regions of DG, CA3, and CA1, and
   jointly DG-CA3-CA1 and CA3-CA1, gamma induction resulted in a
   statistically significant improvement in terms of increased numbers of
   spikes, spikes per burst, and burst duration as compared with the model
   simulating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The positive maximal Lyapunov
   exponent was negative in both the control model and the one with gamma
   induction as opposed to the pathological model where it was positive
   within the DG-CA3-CA1 region. Gamma induction resulted in decreased
   transfer entropy in accordance with the information flow in DG -> CA3
   and CA3 -> CA1. Conclusions: The results of simulation studies show that
   inducing gamma oscillations in the hippocampus may reduce Alzheimer's
   disease related pathology. Pathologically higher transfer entropy values
   after gamma induction returned to values comparable to the control

   connectivity in default mode subnetworks and its clinical-pathological
   relationships in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We separately
   investigated the modulation of 2 default mode subnetworks, as identified
   with independent component analysis, by comparing APOE-epsilon 4
   carriers to noncarriers with AD. We further analyzed the interaction
   effects of APOE (APOE-epsilon 4 carriers vs noncarriers) with PICALM
   (rs3851179-GG vs rs3851179-A-allele carriers) on episodic memory (EM)
   deficits, reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and
   decreased metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks. The
   metabolic connectivity in the ventral default mode network (vDMN) was
   positively correlated with EM scores (beta =0.441, P < .001). The
   APOE-epsilon 4 carriers had significantly lower metabolic connectivity
   in the vDMN than the APOE-epsilon 4 carriers (t(96) = -2.233, P = .028).
   There was an effect of the APOE-PICALM (rs3851179) interactions on
   reduced CMRgl in regions of vDMN (P < .001), and on memory deficits
   (F-3,F-93 =5.568, P = .020). This study identified that PICALM may
   modulates memory deficits, reduced CMRgl and decreased metabolic
   connectivity in the vDMN in APOE-epsilon 4 carriers. {[}18F]

Abstract = {{Background: Memory for music has attracted much recent interest in
   Alzheimer's disease but the underlying brain mechanisms have not been
   defined in patients directly. Here we addressed this issue in an
   Alzheimer's disease cohort using activation fMRI of two core musical
   memory systems.
   Methods: We studied 34 patients with younger onset Alzheimer's disease
   led either by episodic memory decline (typical Alzheimer's disease) or
   by visuospatial impairment (posterior cortical atrophy) in relation to
   19 age-matched healthy individuals. We designed a novel fMRI paradigm
   based on passive listening to melodies that were either previously
   familiar or unfamiliar (musical semantic memory) and either presented
   singly or repeated (incidental musical episodic memory).
   Results: Both syndromic groups showed significant functional
   neuroanatomical alterations relative to the healthy control group. For
   musical semantic memory, disease-associated activation group differences
   were localised to right inferior frontal cortex (reduced activation in
   the group with memory-led Alzheimer's disease); while for incidental
   musical episodic memory, disease-associated activation group differences
   were localised to precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (abnormally
   enhanced activation in the syndromic groups). In post-scan behavioural
   testing, both patient groups had a deficit of musical episodic memory
   relative to healthy controls whereas musical semantic memory was
   unimpaired.
   Conclusions: Our findings define functional neuroanatomical substrates
   for the differential involvement of musical semantic and incidental
   episodic memory in major phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. The complex
   dynamic profile of brain activation group differences observed suggests
   that musical memory may be an informative probe of neural network
   function in Alzheimer's disease. These findings may guide the
   development of future musical interventions in dementia. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {{BackgroundImpairments in activities of daily living (ADL) are a
   criterion for Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, ADL gradually
   decline in AD, impacting on advanced (a-ADL, complex interpersonal or
   social functioning), instrumental (IADL, maintaining life in community),
   and finally basic functions (BADL, activities related to physiological
   and self-maintenance needs). Information and communication technologies
   (ICT) have become an increasingly important aspect of daily functioning.
   Yet, the links of ADL, ICT, and neuropathology of AD dementia are poorly
   understood. Such knowledge is critical as it can provide biomarker
   evidence of functional decline in AD.MethodsADL were evaluated with the
   Technology-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (T-ADLQ) in 33
   patients with AD and 30 controls. ADL were divided in BADL, IADL, and
   a-ADL. The three domain subscores were covaried against gray matter
   atrophy via voxel-based morphometry.ResultsOur results showed that three
   domain subscores of ADL correlate with several brain structures, with a
   varying degree of overlap between them. BADL score correlated mostly
   with frontal atrophy, IADL with more widespread frontal, temporal and
   occipital atrophy and a-ADL with occipital and temporal atrophy.
   Finally, ICT subscale was associated with atrophy in the
   precuneus.ConclusionsThe association between ADL domains and
   neurodegeneration in AD follows a traceable neuropathological pathway
   which involves different neural networks. This the first evidence of ADL
   phenotypes in AD characterised by specific patterns of functional
   decline and well-defined neuropathological changes. The identification
   of such phenotypes can yield functional biomarkers for dementias such as

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proceeding hot issue
   along with a sharp upward trend in the incidence rate. Recently, early
   diagnosis of AD employing Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a specific
   hallmark has been an increasingly significant hot topic area. In
   consideration of the limited size of available EEG spectral images, how
   to extract more abstract features for better generalization still
   remains tremendously troubling. In this paper, we demonstrate that it
   can be settled well with multi-task learning strategy based on
   discriminative convolutional high-order Boltzmann Machine with hybrid
   feature maps. First, differently from our original model - Contractive
   Slab and Spike Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (CssCDBM), we
   directly conduct EEG spectral image classification via inducing label
   layer, resulting in a discriminative version of CssCDBM, referred to as
   DCssCDBM. This demonstrates DCssCDBM can be extended well into the
   classification model instead of feature extractor alone previously.
   Then, the most important approach innovation is that we train our
   DCssCDBM with multi-task learning framework via EEG spectral images
   based Identification and verification tasks for overfitting reduction
   for the first time, which could increase the inter-subject variations
   and reduce the intra-subject variations respectively, both of which are
   essential to early diagnosis of AD. The proposed method shows the better
   ability of high-level representations extraction and demonstrates the
   advanced results over several state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2019

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
   diseases. In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great
   significance to artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms.
   Among the diverse modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET
   are widely used for this task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) to integrate all the multi-modality information
   included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET images of the hippocampal area, for
   the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning
   algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features,
   instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the
   diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the proposed
   network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images
   in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as
   CN) subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild
   cognitive impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild
   cognitive impairment (pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10\%
   for CN vs. AD task, 87.46\% for CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90\% for sMCI
   vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework yields a state-of-the-art
   performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated that (1)
   segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the
   classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data
   generates better results.}},

Title = {{Proof of principle: Preoperative cognitive reserve and brain integrity

Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Preoperative cognitive reserve and brain integrity may explain commonly
   observed intraoperative fluctuations seen on a standard anesthesia depth
   monitor used ubiquitously in operating rooms throughout the nation.
   Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and
   organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity
   changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of:
   1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and
   white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current
   cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory,
   episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative
   neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative
   tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS).
   Methods
   This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented
   older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the
   same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative
   neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic
   resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS
   was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously
   intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data
   analyses used correlation and regression modeling.
   Results
   Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The
   mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54\% were male, 89\% were white, and
   the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76
   (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly
   associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG
   intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value
   between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with
   cognitive reserve (r = -. 40, p =.003), brain integrity (r = -. 37, p
   =.007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed
   cognitive efficiency; r = -. 31, p =.021). Hierarchical regression
   models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive
   reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that
   intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p =.001), premorbid cognitive
   reserve (p =.008), and current brain integrity (p =.004) explained a
   significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from
   the BIS monitor.
   Conclusions
   Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were
   more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor.
   Researchers need to replicate findings within larger cohorts and other
   surgery types.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning (ML) is a growing field that provides tools for

   The framework was tested on data from first-episode schizophrenia

   feature extraction methods, using VBM, DBM, and a combination of both
   morphometry methods. Thus, features of different types were available
   for model adaptation. As we expected, the combination of features
   increased the MLP classification accuracy up to 73.12\%-an improvement
   of 5\% versus MLP-based only on VBM or DBM features. To further verify

Abstract = {{The complex patterns of the neuroimaging data are analyzed successfully
   with bio-medical imaging applications. The patients with/without AD can
   be discriminated effectively through several biomedical imaging
   modalities such as, sMRI, fMRI, PET and so on. In this paper, brain
   images from structural MRI (sMRI) are used for better categorization of
   3 subjects namely, NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment)
   and AD (Alzheimer's disease). Moreover, ambiguous training data employed
   for the discrimination of subjects may mislead the classifier to take
   incorrect decisions and in turn degrades the classification performance.
   In order to recover these hurdles, we propose an automated reliable
   system for the detection of AD affected patients accurately from the
   brain images of sMRI. The proposed system is a multi-stage system
   comprising four key phases namely, i) pre-processing, ii) feature
   extraction, iii) feature selection and iv) detection phase. In the
   initial phase, ROI regions related to Hippocampus (HC) and Posterior
   Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using
   Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. In the feature extraction
   stage, important texture and shape features are extracted from HC and
   PCC involved in three brain planes. Nearly, 19 highly relevant AD
   related features are selected through a multiple-criterion feature
   selection method. It should be noted that, the class labels when
   explored manually consumes more time and turns to be an expensive
   process. Therefore, it is essential to construct an automatic method to
   identify irrelevant samples in the training data to enhance the
   decision-making process. With this in mind, at the detection phase, a
   novel classification technique is proposed by combining the Kernel fuzzy
   c-means clustering (i.e. unsupervised learning technique) and
   Back-propagation artificial neural network (i.e. supervised learning
   technique) to categorize NC, MCI and AD from the brain images of sMRI.
   This proposed KFCM based BPANN algorithm can improve the classification
   performance by removing the suspicious training samples. The proposed
   frameworks efficiency is evaluated with the ADNI subset and then to the
   Bordeaux-3 city dataset. The experimental validation of our proposed
   approach attains an accuracy of 97.63\%, 95.4\%, 96.4\% for the most
   challenging classification tasks AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI,
   respectively.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Recent deep learning models have shown remarkable accuracy
   for the diagnostic classification. However, they have limitations in
   clinical application due to the gap between the training cohorts and
   real-world data. We aimed to develop a model trained only by normal
   brain PET data with an unsupervised manner to identify an abnormality in
   various disorders as imaging data of the clinical routine.
   Methods: Using variational autoencoder, a type of unsupervised learning,
   Abnormality Score was defined as how far a given brain image is from the
   normal data. The model was applied to FDG PET data of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical routine
   FDG PET data for assessing behavioral abnormality and seizures. Accuracy
   was measured by the area under curve (AUC) of
   receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. We investigated whether
   deep learning has additional benefits with experts' visual
   interpretation to identify abnormal patterns.
   Findings: The AUC of the ROC curve for differentiating AD was 0.90. The
   changes in cognitive scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up were
   significantly correlated with Abnormality Score at baseline. The AUC of
   the ROC curve for discriminating patients with various disorders from
   controls was 0.74. Experts' visual interpretation was helped by the deep
   learning model to identify abnormal patterns in 60\% of cases initially

Abstract = {{In the field of computer-aided Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis,
   jointly identifying brain diseases and predicting clinical scores using
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have attracted increasing attention
   since these two tasks are highly correlated. Most of existing joint
   learning approaches require hand-crafted feature representations for MR
   images. Since hand-crafted features of MRI and classification/regression
   models may not coordinate well with each other, conventional methods may
   lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, demographic information
   (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also be related to
   brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic performance.
   However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate such
   demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we
   propose a deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM2 L) framework for
   simultaneous brain disease classification and clinical score regression,
   using MRI data and demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we
   first identify the discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in
   a data-driven manner, and then extract multiple image patches around
   these detected landmarks. We then propose a deep multi-task
   multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint classification and
   regression. Our DM2 L framework can not only automatically learn
   discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate
   the demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We
   evaluate the proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with
   1984 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that DM2 L is
   superior to several state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the
   tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.}},

Abstract = {{Objective To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar
   degeneration (FTLD) with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-Tau)
   proteinopathy across hemispheres in primary progressive aphasia (PPA)
   using digital histopathology and to identify clinicopathological
   correlates of these distinct proteinopathies. Methods In an autopsy
   cohort of PPA (FTLD-TDP = 13, FTLD-Tau = 14), we analyzed laterality and
   regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a
   validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue
   from up to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology
   to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language
   features. Results Postmortem cortical pathology was left-lateralized in
   both FTLD-TDP (beta = -0.15, standard error {[}SE] = 0.05, p = 0.007)
   and FTLD-Tau (beta = -0.09, SE = 0.04, p = 0.015), but the degree of
   lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before
   death (beta = -8.18, SE = 3.22, p = 0.015). Among 5 core pathology
   regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal
   cortex (OFC) in FTLD-TDP, which was greater than in FTLD-Tau (F = 47.07,
   df = 1,17, p < 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD-Tau,
   which was greater than in FTLD-TDP (F = 19.34, df = 1,16, p < 0.001).
   Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic
   resonance imaging cortical thickness (beta = -0.04, SE = 0.01, p =
   0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA
   syndromic variant, single-word comprehension impairment was associated
   with greater left OFC pathology (t = -3.72, df = 10.72, p = 0.004) and
   nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t = -3.62, df = 12.00,
   p = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions. Interpretation In PPA,
   FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of
   left-lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem
   structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain
   regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex

Pages = {{1-10}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder
   with progressive impairment of memory and other mental functions.
   Magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been widely used as an important
   imaging modality of brain for AD diagnosis and monitoring the disease
   progression. The longitudinal analysis of sequential MRIs is important
   to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis
   for more accurate diagnosis. Most existing methods extracted the
   features capturing the morphological abnormalities of brain and their
   longitudinal changes using MRIs and then designed a classifier to
   discriminate different groups. However, these methods have several
   limitations. First, since the feature extraction and classifier model
   are independent, the extracted features may not capture the full
   characteristics of brain abnormalities related to AD. Second,
   longitudinal MR images may be missing at some time points for some
   subjects, which results in difficulties for extraction of consistent
   features for longitudinal analysis. In this paper, we present a
   classification framework based on combination of convolutional and
   recurrent neural networks for longitudinal analysis of structural MR
   images in AD diagnosis. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is
   constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images for the
   classification task. After that, recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with
   cascaded three bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is
   constructed on the outputs of CNN at multiple time points for extracting
   the longitudinal features for AD classification. Instead of
   independently performing feature extraction and classifier training, the
   proposed method jointly learns the spatial and longitudinal features and
   disease classifier, which can achieve optimal performance. In addition,
   the proposed method can model the longitudinal analysis using RNN from
   the imaging data at various time points. Our method is evaluated with
   the longitudinal TI-weighted MR images of 830 participants including 198
   AD, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 229 normal controls (NC)
   subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves
   classification accuracy of 91.33\% for AD vs. NC and 71.71\% for pMCI
   vs. sMCI, demonstrating the promising performance for longitudinal MR
   image analysis. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to compare the computer model of synaptic
   breakdown in an Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in the dentate gyrus
   (DG), CA3 and CA1 regions of the hippocampus with a control model using
   neuronal parameters and methods describing the complexity of the system,
   such as the correlative dimension, Shannon entropy and positive maximal
   Lyapunov exponent. The model of synaptic breakdown (from 13\% to 50\%)
   in the hippocampus modeling the dynamics of an Alzheimer's disease-like
   pathology was simulated. Modeling consisted in turning off one after the
   other EC2 connections and connections from the dentate gyrus on the CA3
   pyramidal neurons. The pathological model of synaptic disintegration was
   compared to a control. The larger synaptic breakdown was associated with
   a statistically significant decrease in the number of spikes (R = -0.79,
   P < 0.001), spikes per burst (R = -0.76, P < 0.001) and burst duration
   (R = -0.83, P < 0.001) and an increase in the inter-burst interval (R =
   0.85, P < 0.001) in DG-CA3-CA1. The positive maximal Lyapunov exponent
   in the control model was negative, but in the pathological model had a
   positive value of DG-CA3-CA1. A statistically significant decrease of
   Shannon entropy with the direction of information flow DG->CA3->CA1 (R =
   -0.79, P < 0.001) in the pathological model and a statistically
   significant increase with greater synaptic breakdown (R = 0.24, P <
   0.05) of the CA3-CA1 region was obtained. The reduction of entropy
   transfer for DG->CA3 at the level of synaptic breakdown of 35\% was
   35\%, compared with the control. Entropy transfer for CA3->CA1 at the
   level of synaptic breakdown of 35\% increased to 95\% relative to the
   control. The synaptic breakdown model in an Alzheimer's disease-like
   pathology in DG-CA3-CA1 exhibits chaotic features as opposed to the
   control. Synaptic breakdown in which an increase of Shannon entropy is
   observed indicates an irreversible process of Alzheimer's disease. The
   increase in synapse loss resulted in decreased information flow and
   entropy transfer in DG->CA3, and at the same time a strong increase in
   CA3->CA1.}},

   acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies
   implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD
   features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal
   cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter
   (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding
   areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and
   freezing of gait (FoG) and falls. Methods Ninety-four PD subjects
   underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ({[}F-18]FEOBV) PET. Results
   Thirty-five subjects (37.2\%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16\%)
   had observed FoG. Univariate volume-of-interest analyses demonstrated
   significantly reduced thalamic (p = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers
   compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in
   the striatum (p = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (p = 0.004) in freezers
   compared to nonfreezers. Whole-brain voxel-based analyses of FEOBV PET
   complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated

   the right lateral geniculate nucleus {[}LGN]), right caudate nucleus,
   and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT

   extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits
   associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus
   complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with

Abstract = {{Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a
   challenging machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect
   temporal dependencies among measurements, make parametric assumptions
   about biomarker trajectories, do not model multiple biomarkers jointly,
   and need an alignment of subjects' trajectories. In this paper,
   recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues.
   However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data,
   which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a
   pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead,
   we propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN
   architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle
   both missing predictor and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is
   applied to model the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six
   volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of
   ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus,
   and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to standard LSTM networks with
   data imputation and a parametric, regression-based DPM method. The
   results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower
   mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with p < 0.05 using
   Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of the MRI
   biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier
   applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly
   larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of
   0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical
   diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount of
   missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best
   performance up until more than 74\% missing values. Finally, it is
   illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to data with
   varying time intervals. This paper shows that built-in handling of
   missing values in training an LSTM network benefits the application of
   RNNs in neurodegenerative disease progression modeling in longitudinal
   cohorts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{White matter abnormalities, revealed by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI),
   are observed in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), representing
   neural network deficits that underlie gradual cognitive decline in
   patients. However, how DTI changes related to the development of Amyloid
   beta (A beta) and tau pathology, two key hallmarks of AD, remain
   elusive. We hypothesized that tauopathy induced by A beta could initiate
   an axonal degeneration, leading to DTI-detectable white matter
   abnormalities. We utilized the visual system of the transgenic p301L tau
   mice as a model system. A beta was injected in Lateral Geniculate
   Nucleus (LGN), where the Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) axons terminate.
   Longitudinal DTI was conducted to detect changes in the optic tract (OT)
   and optic nerve (ON), containing the distal and proximal segments of RGC
   axons, respectively. Our results showed DTI changes in OT (significant
   13.2\% reduction in axial diffusion, AxD vs. vehicle controls) followed
   by significant alterations in ON AxD and fractional anisotropy, FA.
   Histology data revealed loss of synapses, RGC axons and cell bodies
   resulting from the A beta injection. We further tested whether
   microtubule-stabilizing compound Epothilone D (EpoD) could ameliorate
   the damage. EpoD co-treatment with A beta was sufficient to prevent A
   beta-induced axon and cell loss. Using an acute injection paradigm, our
   data suggest that EpoD may mediate its protective effect by blocking
   localized, acute A beta-induced tau phosphorylation. This study
   demonstrates white matter disruption resulting from localized A beta,
   the importance of tau pathology induction to changes in white matter
   connectivity, and the use of EpoD as a potential therapeutic avenue to
   prevent the axon loss in AD.}},

Abstract = {{Some forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are the clinical
   precursors of Alzheimer's disease (AD), while other MCI types tend to
   remain stable over-time and do not progress to AD. To identify and
   choose effective and personalized strategies to prevent or slow the
   progression of AD, we need to develop objective measures that are able
   to discriminate the MCI patients who are at risk of AD from those MCI
   patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we present a novel deep
   learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D
   separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who have
   a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years.
   Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data
   as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine
   learning model compared to previous ones are the following: 1) our deep
   learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it jointly learns to
   simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD vs.
   healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature
   extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier
   employs fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which
   significantly limits data-overfitting (we use similar to 550,000 network
   parameters, which is orders of magnitude lower than other network
   designs); 3) both structural MRI images and their warp field
   characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in relation to
   the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much
   information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed
   on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192
   AD patients, n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who
   convert to AD and MCI patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184
   healthy controls).
   The most predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images
   and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast,
   the warp field metrics were of little added predictive value. The
   algorithm was able to distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within
   3 years from those patients with stable MCI over the same time-period
   with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 and a 10-fold
   cross-validated accuracy of 86\%, a sensitivity of 87.5\%, and
   specificity of 85\%. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance
   achieved so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC
   of 1 and 100\% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying
   patients with AD from healthy controls. Our classification framework was
   also robust to the use of different co-registration templates and
   potentially irrelevant features/image portions.
   Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging
   modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The
   convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image
   dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis
   system targeting the prediction of several medical conditions and
   neuropsychiatric disorders via multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical
   data.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of
   progressive and irreversible dementia, and accurate diagnosis of AD at
   its prodromal stage is clinically important. Currently, computer-aided
   diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using
   F-18-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET)
   imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features or deep learning
   methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient classification
   accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore aimed to
   implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to improve
   the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can
   reveal pathological information. Methods: In this study, F-18-FDG PET
   and clinical assessments were collected in a cohort of 422 individuals
   {[}including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy controls (HCs)]
   from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 44
   individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital,
   Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a
   two-sample Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs)
   based on 30 AD patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on
   two time scans of 32 HCs from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha
   coefficient for radiomic feature stability analyses. Pearson's
   correlation coefficients were regarded as a feature selection criterion,
   to select effective features associated with the clinical cognitive
   scale {[}clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes (CDRSB);
   Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times
   cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to
   test the ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD
   patients. Results: As a result, we identified brain regions which were
   mainly distributed in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs.
   A total of 168 radiomic features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The
   classification experiment led to maximal accuracies of 91.5\%, 83.1\%
   and 85.9\% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI versus HCs and AD versus
   MCI. Conclusion: The research in this paper proved that the novel

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis of the neurodegenerative, irreversible disease
   Alzheimer's is crucial for effective disease management. Dementia from
   Alzheimer's is an agglomerated result of complex criteria taking roots
   at both medical, social, educational backgrounds. There being multiple
   predictive features for the mental state of a subject, machine learning
   methodologies are ideal for classification due to their extremely
   powerful feature-learning capabilities. This study primarily attempts to
   classify subjects as having or not having the early symptoms of the
   disease and on the sidelines, endeavors to detect if a subject has
   already transformed towards Alzheimer's. The research utilizes the OASIS
   (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) longitudinal dataset which has a
   uniform distribution of demented, nondemented subjects and establishes
   the use of novel features such as socio-economic status and educational
   background for early detection of dementia, proven by performing
   exploratory data analysis. This research exploits three data-engineered
   versions of the OASIS dataset with one eliminating the incomplete cases,
   another one with synthetically imputed data and lastly, one that
   eliminates gender as a feature-eventually producing the best results and
   making the model a gender-neutral unique piece. The neural network
   applied is of three layers with two ReLU hidden layers and a third
   softmax classification layer. The best accuracy of 86.49\% obtained on
   cross-validation set upon trained parameters is greater than traditional
   learning algorithms applied previously on the same data. Drilling down
   to two classes namely demented and non-demented, 100\% accuracy has been
   remarkably achieved. Additionally, perfect recall and a precision of
   0.8696 for the `demented' class have been achieved. The significance of
   this work consists in endorsing educational, socio-economic factors as
   useful features and eliminating the gender-bias using a simple neural
   network model without the need for complete MRI tuples that can be
   compensated for using specialized imputation methods.}},

Abstract = {{Background
   Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI) is essential for timely treatment. Machine learning and
   multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for the diagnosis of brain
   disorders are explicitly attracting attention in the neuroimaging
   community. In this paper, we propose a voxel-wise discriminative
   framework applied to multi-measure resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) that
   integrates hybrid MVPA and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the
   automated discrimination of AD and MCI from the cognitive normal (CN)
   state.
   Materials and methods
   We used two rs-fMRI cohorts: the public Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative database (ADNI2) and an in-house Alzheimer's disease cohort
   from South Korea, both including individuals with AD, MCI, and normal
   controls. After extracting three-dimensional (3-D) patterns measuring
   regional coherence and functional connectivity during the resting state,
   we performed univariate statistical t-tests to generate a 3-D mask that
   retained only voxels showing significant changes. Given the initial
   univariate features, to enhance discriminative patterns, we implemented
   MVPA feature reduction using support vector machine-recursive feature
   elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection
   operator (LASSO), in combination with the univariate t-test.
   Classifications were performed by an ELM, and its efficiency was
   compared to linear and nonlinear (radial basis function) SVMs.

   The maximal accuracies achieved by the method in the ADNI2 cohort were
   98.86\% (p<0.001) and 98.57\% (p<0.001) for AD and MCI vs. CN,
   respectively. In the in-house cohort, the same accuracies were 98.70\%
   (p<0.001) and 94.16\% (p<0.001).
   Conclusion
   From a clinical perspective, combining extreme learning machine and
   hybrid MVPA applied on concatenations of multiple rs-fMRI biomarkers can
   potentially assist the clinicians in AD and MCI diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{In this article, the authors aim to maximally utilize multimodality
   neuroimaging and genetic data for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   and its prodromal status, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), from normal
   aging subjects. Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET
   provide valuable insights into brain abnormalities, while genetic data
   such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a
   patient's AD risk factors. When these data are used together, the
   accuracy of AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are
   heterogeneous (e.g., with different data distributions), and have
   different number of samples (e.g., with far less number of PET samples
   than the number of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using
   these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage
   deep feature learning and fusion framework, where deep neural network is
   trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature
   representations for different combinations of modalities, via effective
   training using the maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in
   the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level
   features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity
   among modalities can be partially addressed, and high-level features
   from different modalities can be combined in the next stage. In the
   second stage, we learn joint latent features for each pair of modality
   combination by using the high-level features learned from the first
   stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the
   learned joint latent features from the second stage. To further increase
   the number of samples during training, we also use data at multiple
   scanning time points for each training subject in the dataset. We
   evaluate the proposed framework using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging
   initiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis, and the experimental results
   show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art
   methods.}},

Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{FEB 13}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition
   marked by a decline in cognitive functions with no validated disease
   modifying treatment. It is critical for timely treatment to detect AD in
   its earlier stage before clinical manifestation. Mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between cognitively normal
   older adults and AD. To predict conversion from MCI to probable AD, we
   applied a deep learning approach, multimodal recurrent neural network.
   We developed an integrative framework that combines not only
   cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also
   longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance
   biomarkers obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
   cohort (ADNI). The proposed framework integrated longitudinal
   multi-domain data. Our results showed that 1) our prediction model for
   MCI conversion to AD yielded up to 75\% accuracy (area under the curve
   (AUC) = 0.83) when using only single modality of data separately; and 2)
   our prediction model achieved the best performance with 81\% accuracy
   (AUC = 0.86) when incorporating longitudinal multi-domain data. A
   multi-modal deep learning approach has potential to identify persons at
   risk of developing AD who might benefit most from a clinical trial or as
   a stratification approach within clinical trials.}},

   Learning and Group ICA for rs-fMRI Measurements}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{11}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To perform automatic assessment of dementia severity using a
   deep learning framework applied to resting-state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data.
   Method: We divided 133 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with clinical
   dementia rating (CDR) scores from 0.5 to 3 into two groups based on
   dementia severity; the groups with very mild/mild (CDR: 0.5-1) and
   moderate to severe (CDR: 2-3) dementia consisted of 77 and 56 subjects,
   respectively. We used rs-fMRI to extract functional connectivity
   features, calculated using independent component analysis (ICA), and
   performed automated severity classification with three-dimensional
   convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) based on deep learning.
   Results: The mean balanced classification accuracy was 0.923 +/- 0.042
   (p < 0.001) with a specificity of 0.946 +/- 0.019 and sensitivity of
   0.896 +/- 0.077. The rs-fMRI data indicated that the medial frontal,
   sensorimotor, executive control, dorsal attention, and visual related
   networks mainly correlated with dementia severity.
   Conclusions: Our CDR-based novel classification using rs-fMRI is an
   acceptable objective severity indicator. In the absence of trained
   neuropsychologists, dementia severity can be objectively and accurately
   classified using a 3D-deep learning framework with rs-fMRI independent
   components.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's is the main reason which leads to memory loss of a human
   being. The living style of an affected person also varies. This
   variation in the lifestyle creates difficulties for a person to spend a
   normal life. The detection of Alzheimer's disease in the initial stage
   accurately has a great significance in the early treatment of the
   disease. Therefore, it is considered as a challenging task. An efficient
   method is proposed to detect the Alzheimer's disease in the early stage
   using magnetic resonance imaging. k-Means clustering is used to develop
   the proposed method for efficient segmentation of the white matter,
   cerebrospinal fluid, and grey matter. The amalgam feature vectors are
   formed using the grey-level co-occurrence matrix and speeded-up robust
   features based on textural feature extraction. Statistical and histogram
   of gradients is used from shape-based features. Fisher linear
   discriminant analysis is used for dimensionality reduction and the
   resampling method is used to handle the class imbalance problem. The
   algorithm is evaluated using the three classifiers k-nearest neighbour,
   support vector machine and random forest. The dataset of OASIS is used
   to assess the outcomes. The proposed approach achieved the optimum

Abstract = {{An early intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly essential
   due to the fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major
   life-threatening issues, especially memory loss among patients in
   society. Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive
   Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience
   benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a
   reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or
   without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a
   novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN)
   classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to
   structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels.
   Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization
   stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and
   Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted
   using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen
   highly relevant AD related features are selected through
   Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN
   classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from
   the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification
   performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both
   the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The
   experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to
   the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves
   an accuracy of about 98.63\%, 95.4\%, 96.4\% in terms of classification
   with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The experimental results suggest
   that the removal of noisy samples from the training data can enhance the
   decision generation process of the expert systems.}},

Abstract = {{The APOE epsilon 4 allele is associated with impaired intrinsic
   functional connectivity in neural networks, especially in the default
   mode network (DMN). However, effective connectivity (EC) reflects the
   direct causal effects of one brain region to another, which has rarely
   been investigated. Recently, Granger causality analysis (GCA) proved
   suitable for the study of directionality in neuronal interactions. Using
   GCA, we examined the differences in the EC between the anterior medial
   prefrontal cortex/posterior cingulate cortex (aMPFC/PCC) and the whole
   brain in 17 epsilon 4 carrying and 32 non-carrying cognitively intact
   elderly individuals. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed
   between the abnormal EC and cognition/neuropathological indices.
   Compared with the non-carriers, the results showed that the epsilon 4
   carriers exhibited decreased EC from the PCC to the whole brain in the
   middle temporal gyrus (MTG), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and
   the precuneus (PCu). Meanwhile, the epsilon 4 carriers demonstrated
   increased EC from the whole brain to the aMPFC in the inferior parietal
   lobe (IPL) and the postcentral gyrus (PCG). The correlation analyses
   suggested that the EC from the IPL/PCG to the aMPFC was related to
   episodic memory in non-carriers, while the decreased EC from the PCC to
   the ACC was associated with increased levels of t-tau in the epsilon 4
   carriers. In epsilon 4 carriers, a negative influence can be traced from
   the PCC to both the anterior and posterior DMN subsystems; meanwhile,
   the anterior DMN subsystem receives compensatory effects from the
   parietal cortex. Early increases in AD-related pathologies in the PCC
   may act as first factors during this pathological process.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives Amyloid-beta (A beta) and tau pathologies are commonly
   observed among clinically normal older individuals at postmortem and can
   now be detected with in vivo neuroimaging. The association and
   interaction of these proteinopathies with prospective cognitive decline
   in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be
   fully elucidated. Methods One hundred thirty-seven older individuals
   (age = 76.3 +/- 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain
   Study underwent A beta (C-11-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau
   (F-18-flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective
   neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of
   cognitive visits = 2.8 +/- 1.1). Tau and A beta PET measures were
   assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex-wise map
   analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive
   Function composites. Results Higher levels of A beta and tau were both
   associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive
   function. Higher cortical A beta was associated with higher tau levels
   in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were
   observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated A beta. A
   significant interaction between tau and A beta was observed in both ROI
   and map-level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was
   observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.
   Interpretation Our results are consistent with the supposition that both
   A beta and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical
   stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging
   and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary
   prevention trials in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1-3 ANN NEUROL

Abstract = {{Objective To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older
   adults (OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the
   relationship of tau accumulation to cortical atrophy. Methods Two
   longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21
   Pittsburg compound B {[}PiB](+), age = 77.6 +/- 4.6 years, 25 female
   {[}F]/17 male {[}M]) and 19 PiB(+) patients with AD (age = 63.1 +/- 10.3
   years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow-up. FTP change, structural
   MRI measures of atrophy, and cross-modal correlations were examined on a
   voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also
   calculated. Results Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest
   increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same
   interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas,
   where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in
   bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy
   in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change
   in FTP and sex, PiB, or APOE. Regional FTP significantly increased at
   follow-up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed
   greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA
   based on PiB status. Interpretation Our findings indicate that tau
   accumulates even in amyloid-negative healthy OA and this process can be
   measured with in vivo tau-PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share
   a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation
   occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant
   atrophy. Ann Neurol 2019; 1-12 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:229-240.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that
   cerebrovascular disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently
   co-occur in older adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease
   influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging
   newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined
   whether a well-validated measure of systemic vascular risk and
   beta-amyloid (A beta) burden have an interactive association with
   regional tau burden. Methods Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in
   152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 +/- 6.1 years) with
   the office-based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk
   algorithm (FHS-CVD). We acquired A beta (C-11-Pittsburgh compound B) and
   tau (F-18-flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A beta PET
   was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 +/- 1.1
   years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early
   site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an
   early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear
   regression models examined FHS-CVD and A beta as interactive predictors
   of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon 4 status, and
   the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan. Results We
   observed a significant interaction between FHS-CVD and A beta burden on
   subsequently measured ITC tau (p < 0.001), whereby combined higher
   FHS-CVD and elevated A beta burden was associated with increased tau.
   The interaction was not significant for EC tau (p = 0.16).
   Interpretation Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when
   coupled with high A beta burden. These results suggest a potential link
   between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol

Abstract = {{Purpose: To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts
   the final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive
   impairment, or neither at fluorine 18 (F-18) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)
   PET of the brain and compare its performance to that of radiologic
   readers.
   Materials and Methods: Prospective F-18-FDG PET brain images from the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies
   from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set
   (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected.
   Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural
   network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90\% of ADNI data set
   and tested on the remaining 10\%, as well as the independent test set,
   with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with
   sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC),
   saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding.
   Results: The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95\%
   confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final
   clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82\% specificity
   at 100\% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final
   diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57\%
   {[}four of seven] sensitivity, 91\% {[}30 of 33] specificity; P<.05).
   Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with
   focus on the entire brain.
   Conclusion: By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a
   deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer
   disease achieved 82\% specificity at 100\% sensitivity, an average of
   75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis. (c) RSNA, 2018}},

Abstract = {{Whole brain segmentation from structural magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) is a prerequisite for most morphological analyses, but is
   computationally intense and can therefore delay the availability of
   image markers after scan acquisition. We introduce QuickNAT, a fully
   convolutional, densely connected neural network that segments a MRI
   brain scan in 20 s. To enable training of the complex network with
   millions of learnable parameters using limited annotated data, we
   propose to first pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing
   segmentation software. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned
   on manual labels to rectify errors in auxiliary labels. With this
   learning strategy, we are able to use large neuroimaging repositories
   without manual annotations for training. In an extensive set of
   evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology,
   and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior
   segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art
   methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. The speed up
   facilitates processing of large data repositories and supports
   translation of imaging biomarkers by making them available within
   seconds for fast clinical decision making.}},

Abstract = {{A data-driven machine deep learning approach is proposed for
   differentiating subjects with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI) and Healthy Control (HC), by only analyzing noninvasive
   scalp EEG recordings. The methodology here proposed consists of
   evaluating the power spectral density (PSD) of the 19-channels EEG
   traces and representing the related spectral profiles into 2-d gray
   scale images (PSD-images). A customized Convolutional Neural Network
   with one processing module of convolution, Rectified Linear Units (ReLu)
   and pooling layer (CNN1) is designed to extract from PSD-images some
   suitable features and to perform the corresponding two and three-ways
   classification tasks. The resulting CNN is shown to provide better
   classification performance when compared to more conventional learning
   machines; indeed, it achieves an average accuracy of 89.8\% in binary
   classification and of 83.3\% in three-ways classification. These results
   encourage the use of deep processing systems (here, an engineered first
   stage, namely the PSD-image extraction, and a second or multiple CNN
   stage) in challenging clinical frameworks. Crown Copyright (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Predicting the age progression of individual brain images from
   longitudinal data has been a challenging problem, while its solution is
   considered key to improve dementia prognosis. Often, approaches are
   limited to group-level predictions, lack the ability to extrapolate, can
   not scale to many samples, or do not operate directly on image inputs.
   We address these issues with the first approach to artificial aging of
   brain images based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks. We
   develop a novel recursive generator model for brain image time series,
   and train it on large-scale longitudinal data sets (ADNI/AIBL). In
   addition to thorough analysis of results on healthy and demented
   subjects, we demonstrate the predictive value of our brain aging model
   in the context of conversion prognosis from mild cognitive impairment to
   Alzheimer's disease. Conversion prognosis for a baseline image is
   achieved in two steps. First, we estimate the future brain image with
   the Generative Adversarial Network. This follow-up image is passed to a
   CNN classifier, pre-trained to discriminate between mild cognitive
   impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It estimates the Alzheimer
   probability for the follow-up image, which represents an effective
   measure for future disease risk.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) are
   cognitive diminished conditions that requires neuropsychological, images
   and complementary test for diagnosis. The electroencephalogram equipment
   is a less expensive, less invasive and a more portable option that image
   ones so there is an increased interest in an EEG based methodology for
   cognitive impairment diagnosis. In this work is presented an eyes closed
   resting state condition EEG signal diagnosis tool, based on wavelet
   decomposition and wavelet entropy. The methodology allows discriminating
   among Healthy, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease people.
   For this purpose theta band-EEG power ratio, beta band-EEG power ratio
   and entropy values distribution through time in 14 electrodes are used.
   Wavelet decomposition is performed on five levels using Haar wavelet
   mother on two seconds windows. After decomposition wavelet power ratio
   and entropy distribution calculation are performed. The characteristics
   are used in a Healthy-MCI, Healthy-AD and MCI-AD classification using
   Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel providing six inputs to a
   neural network (two layer, 13 neurons in the hidden layer) in charge of

Abstract = {{Increasing numbers of MRI brain scans, improvements in image resolution,
   and advancements in MRI acquisition technology are causing significant
   increases in the demand for and burden on radiologists' efforts in terms
   of reading and interpreting brain MRIs. Content-based image retrieval
   (CBIR) is an emerging technology for reducing this burden by supporting
   the reading of medical images. High dimensionality is a major challenge
   in developing a CBIR system that is applicable for 3D brain MRIs. In
   this study, we propose a system called disease-oriented data
   concentration with metric learning (DDCML). In DDCML, we introduce deep
   metric learning to a 3D convolutional autoencoder (CAE). Our proposed
   DDCML scheme achieves a high dimensional compression rate (4096:1) while
   preserving the disease-related anatomical features that are important
   for medical image classification. The low-dimensional representation
   obtained by DDCML improved the clustering performance by 29.1\% compared
   to plain 3D-CAE in terms of discriminating Alzheimer's disease patients
   from healthy subjects, and successfully reproduced the relationships of
   the severity of disease categories that were not included in the

Abstract = {{During the last decade, deep learning and Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNNs) have produced a devastating impact on computer vision, yielding
   exceptional results on a variety of problems, including analysis of

   images with the downside of a large increase in the computational load.
   In particular, state of the art CNNs have been used for brain Nuclear
   Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging, with the aim of estimating the
   patients' age. In fact, a large discrepancy between the real and the
   estimated age is a clear alarm for the onset of neurodegenerative

Abstract = {{The accurate classification of AD is very essential for both patient and
   social care, and it will be more significant once the treatment options
   are available to reverse the progress of the disease. The recent success
   of deep learning techniques has rapidly advanced the automatic
   classification of AD using neuroimaging biomarkers such as MRI. However,
   there exist two major challenges. First, training a deep convolutional
   neural network (CNN) from scratch relies on a large number of labeled
   training data to obtain high accuracy without overfitting. Second, due
   to high computational cost, most of the existing techniques employ 2D
   CNN that cannot leverage the complete spatial information; hence, it
   loses the inter-slice correlation. To address these limitations, we
   combine a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically long short-term
   memory (LSTM) on top of the bottleneck layer of pre-trained DenseNet
   architecture, a deep CNN has already been trained on a large-scale
   dataset called ImageNet. In addition to the intra-slice features
   extracted from the deep CNN, the proposed technique exploits the
   inter-slice features through LSTM in order to discriminate the patients
   having AD and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status from the brain MRI
   data. Through experimental results, we show that our proposed model has
   better performance than state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the

Abstract = {{Emotion classification using EEG signal processing has the potential of
   significantly improving the social integration of patients suffering
   from neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)

   the implementation of high-fidelity emotion recognition systems is the
   inadequacy of EEG data in terms of Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   duration, and subject-to-subject variability. In this paper, we present
   a novel, integrated framework for semigeneric emotion detection using
   (1) independent component analysis for EEG preprocessing, (2) EEG
   subject clustering by unsupervised learning, and (3) a convolutional
   neural network (CNN) for EEG-based emotion recognition. The training and
   testing data was built using the combination of two publicly available
   repositories (DEAP and DREAMER), and a local dataset collected at

Abstract = {{Early prediction of diseased brain conditions is critical for curing
   illness and preventing irreversible neuronal dysfunction and loss.
   Generically regarding the different neuroimaging modalities as filtered,
   complementary insights of brain's anatomical and functional
   organization, multimodal data fusion could be hypothesized to enhance
   the predictive power as compared to a unimodal prediction of disease
   progression. More recently, deep learning (DL) based methods on
   structural MRI (sMRI) data have outperformed classical machine learning
   approaches in several neuroimaging applications including diagnostic
   classification and prediction. Similarly, functional MRI (fMRI) features
   estimated using a dynamic (i.e. time-varying) functional connectivity
   (FC) approach have been found to be more discriminative and predictive
   of the clinical diagnosis than those based on the static FC approach.
   Motivated by this, we introduce a novel multimodal data fusion framework
   featuring deep residual learning of non-linear sMRI features and dynamic
   FC (dFC) based extraction of fMRI features to predict the subset of
   individuals with mild cognitive impairments who would progress to
   Alzheimer's disease within a time-period of three years from the
   baseline scanning sessions. Our cross-validated results from the
   developed multimodal (sMRI-fMRI) data fusion framework demonstrate a
   significant improvement in performance over the unimodal prediction
   analyses with the fMRI (p = 7.03 x 10(-7)) and sMRI (p = 6.72 x 10(-4))
   modalities. As such, the findings in this work highlight the benefits of
   combining multiple neuroimaging data modalities via data fusion,
   corroborate the predictive value of the tested DL and dFC features and
   argue in favor of exploration of similar approaches to learn
   neuroanatomical and functional alterations in the neuroimaging data.}},

   similar images existing in the database and also to take a correct
   decision during diagnosis. So, we carried out our studies by collecting
   the images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from the Open Access
   Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. Later, we have categorized
   the collected MRI images into three different groups based on the size
   of a ventricular region of the brain and then employed second and higher
   order statistical methods to extract the textural features from each
   image. Thus, we obtain multiple textural features using Gray Level
   Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Law Texture Energy Measure. After
   obtaining the textural features, the top matched images are retrieved
   based on the similarity measure computed between the feature vector of a
   query image and the images present in the database. Finally, the
   retrieval performance is compared for the extracted texture features

   methods. The combination of features from the above methods shows the

Abstract = {{Determining Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in its early stages is very
   important to prepare proper care for the patient. In this study, we
   aimed to create fast and accurate automated classification system to
   determine AD with the minimum data collected from the patient. Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) is widely used to diagnose AD. When the cost of
   the technique and risks of the procedures are considered, there is a
   need for different solutions. With the availability of neural network
   chips, it is even possible to build portable devices for Alzheimer's
   detection. We propose fast and successful method to detect Alzheimer
   using Deep Neural Network (DNN). To reduce the complexity of the
   algorithm, Random Forest method was used to eliminate some of the
   features. Success of Random Forest to eliminate the features and success
   of DNN to detect AD are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's Disease is an irreversible, progressive brain disorder that
   slowly destroys cognitive abilities. In recent years, the relationship
   between the prodromal Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) stage and the
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) stage has been extensively researched in hopes
   of finding a path towards early diagnosis. Early detection at the MCI
   stage can help determine appropriate treatment plans as well as assist
   in clinical trial enrollment as 32\% of individuals with MCI will
   develop AD within 5 years. Computer vision studies leveraging Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and
   Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have led to encouraging results in
   classifying the different stages of AD. Studies around DTI specifically
   have shown that structural differences in white matter are prevalent
   between these stages. Rather than classification between stages, we
   propose a recurrent neural network model (RNN) based on the DTI modality
   for identifying the subset (32\%) of individuals with Early Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) that will develop AD. Our results are
   state-of-the-art and demonstrate high accuracy in determining which
   individuals will develop AD within the next 5-7 years. Additionally, we
   propose our augmentation methods for DTI data as well as our
   classification accuracy across the traditional AD stage categories.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, machine learning gained considerable attention

   Given its ability to detect subtle and complicated patterns, deep
   learning (DL) has been utilized widely in neuroimaging studies for
   medical data analysis and automated diagnostics with varying degrees of
   success. In this paper, we question the remarkable accuracies of the
   best performing models by assessing generalization performance of the
   state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) models on the
   classification of two most common neurodegenerative diseases, namely
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Parkinson's Disease (PD) using MRI. We
   demonstrate the impact of the data division strategy on the model
   performances by comparing the results derived from two different split
   approaches. We first evaluated the performance of the CNN models by
   dividing the dataset at the subject level in which all of the MRI slices
   of a patient are put into either training or test set. We then observed
   that pooling together all slices prior to applying cross-validation, as
   erroneously done in a number of previous studies, leads to inflated
   accuracies by as much as 26\% for the classification of the diseases.}},

Abstract = {{An estimated 24 million people worldwide have dementia, the majority of
   whom are thought to have Alzheimer's disease(AD). Nowadays, Alzheimer's
   disease represents a significant public health concern and has been
   identified as a research priority. Most unfortunately, there is little
   chance of a cure for Alzheimer's disease, and the disease is difficult
   to detect before the dominant characteristics such as memory loss are
   manifested. Therefore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has become
   an urgent problem today. Studies have shown that mild cognitive
   impairment(MCI) is a state between Alzheimer's disease and normal, and
   the chance of it turning into Alzheimer's disease is high. Therefore, if
   machines can automatically learn the characteristics of three kinds of
   human brain magnetic resonance(MR) images through deep learning, and
   help doctors to diagnose patients with mild cognitive impairment or
   Alzheimer's disease accurately, it will be beneficial for the early
   diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we improve the
   Inception(V3) neural network and further test the effectiveness of the
   enhanced network based on the international Alzheimer's disease data
   set, which consists of brain magnetic resonance images. The results show
   that the average accuracy of our approach can reach 85.7\%.}},

   networks can be extended to non-standard data types such as structured
   data (e.g., graphs) or manifold-valued data (e.g., unit vectors or
   special matrices). Often, sizable empirical improvements are possible
   when the geometry of such data spaces are incorporated into the design
   of the model, architecture, and the algorithms. Motivated by
   neuroimaging applications, we study formulations where the data are
   sequential manifold-valued measurements. This case is common in brain
   imaging, where the samples correspond to symmetric positive definite
   matrices or orientation distribution functions. Instead of a recurrent
   model which poses computational/technical issues, and inspired by recent
   results showing the viability of dilated convolutional models for
   sequence prediction, we develop a dilated convolutional neural network
   architecture for this task. On the technical side, we show how the
   modules needed in our network can be derived while explicitly taking the
   Riemannian manifold structure into account. We show how the operations
   needed can leverage known results for calculating the weighted Frechet
   Mean (wFM). Finally, we present scientific results for group difference
   analysis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where the groups are derived using
   AD pathology load: here the model finds several brain fiber bundles that
   are related to AD even when the subjects are all still cognitively
   healthy.}},

   image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical
   studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together
   with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The
   key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative
   model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of
   how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are
   influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal
   measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates
   recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provide a
   smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be
   easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning
   variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller
   sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two
   video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for
   both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples.
   Further, using our generated longitudinal image samples, we show that we
   can capture the pathological progressions in the brain that turn out to
   be consistent with the existing literature, and could facilitate various

Abstract = {{Incomplete data problem is unavoidable in automated brain disease
   diagnosis using multi-modal neuroimages (e.g., MRI and PET). To utilize
   all available subjects to train diagnostic models, deep networks have
   been proposed to directly impute missing neuroimages by treating all
   voxels in a 3D volume equally. These methods are not diagnosis-oriented,
   as they ignore the disease-image specific information conveyed in
   multi-modal neuroimages, i.e., (1) disease may cause abnormalities only
   at local brain regions, and (2) different modalities may highlight
   different disease-associated regions. In this paper, we propose a
   unified disease-image specific deep learning framework for joint image
   synthesis and disease diagnosis using incomplete multi-modal
   neuroimaging data. Specifically, by using the whole-brain images as
   input, we design a disease-image specific neural network (DSNN) to
   implicitly model disease-image specificity in MRI/PET scans using the
   spatial cosine kernel. Moreover, we develop a feature-consistent
   generative adversarial network (FGAN) to synthesize missing images,
   encouraging DSNN feature maps of synthetic images and their respective
   real images to be consistent. Our DSNN and FGAN can be jointly trained,
   by which missing images are imputed in a task-oriented manner for brain
   disease diagnosis. Experimental results on 1, 466 subjects suggest that
   our method not only generates reasonable neuroimages, but also achieves
   the state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) identification and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion
   prediction.}},

Abstract = {{Simulating images representative of neurodegenerative diseases is
   important for predicting patient outcomes and for validation of
   computational models of disease progression. This capability is valuable
   for secondary prevention clinical trials where outcomes and screening
   criteria involve neuroimaging. Traditional computational methods are
   limited by imposing a parametric model for atrophy and are extremely
   resource-demanding. Recent advances in deep learning have yielded
   data-driven models for longitudinal studies (e.g., face ageing) that are
   capable of generating synthetic images in real-time. Similar solutions
   can be used to model trajectories of atrophy in the brain, although new
   challenges need to be addressed to ensure accurate disease progression
   modelling. Here we propose Degenerative Adversarial NeuroImage Net
   (DaniNet)-a new deep learning approach that learns to emulate the effect
   of neurodegeneration on MRI by simulating atrophy as a function of ages,
   and disease progression. DaniNet uses an underlying set of Support
   Vector Regressors (SVRs) trained to capture the patterns of regional
   intensity changes that accompany disease progression. DaniNet produces
   whole output images, consisting of 2D-MRI slices that are constrained to
   match regional predictions from the SVRs. DaniNet is also able to
   maintain the unique brain morphology of individuals. Adversarial
   training ensures realistic brain images and smooth temporal progression.
   We train our model using 9652 T1-weighted (longitudinal) MRI extracted
   from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We
   perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a separate test set
   of 1283 images (also from ADNI) demonstrating the ability of DaniNet to
   produce accurate and convincing synthetic images that emulate disease
   progression.}},

   time-consuming and error-prone. We propose a convolutional neural
   network for structural segmentation based on deformation of an example

   The hippocampus is one of the first subcortical structures affected by
   Alzheimer's disease, atrophying as the disease progresses. As the
   disease state may be unknown, and due to the varying degrees of atrophy,
   an accurate shape prior is not always available. The proposed network is
   based on an adapted spatial transformer network that learns a
   deformation field to resample an initial binary mask, to create an
   output segmentation. This segmentation is learnt by the network from the
   input T1-weighted MRI in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on the HarP
   dataset show that the network outperforms other segmentation methods and
   is consistent across disease states, independent of the degree of
   disease-related atrophy. We also explore the effect of the initial
   binary mask on the segmentation, showing that the it is insensitive to
   the size and initial location of the binary mask.}},

   still difficult to integrate multi-modal imaging data into a single deep
   model, to gain benefit from complementary datasets as much as possible.
   To address this challenge, we propose a cascaded deep model to capture
   both brain structural and functional characteristic for MCI
   classification. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, a graph convolution network
   (GCN) is constructed based on brain structural connectome and it works
   with a one-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) which is responsible for
   inferring the temporal features from brain functional activities. We
   named this cascaded deep model as Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural
   Network (GCRNN). Using Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
   (ADNI-3) dataset as a test-bed, our method can achieve 97.3\% accuracy
   between normal controls (NC) and MCI patients.}},

Abstract = {{The procedure of aligning a positron emission tomography (PET) image
   with a common coordinate system, spatial normalization, typically
   demands a corresponding structural magnetic resonance (MR) image.
   However, MR imaging is not always available or feasible for the subject,
   which calls for enabling spatial normalization without MR, MR-less
   spatial normalization. In this work, we propose a template-free approach
   to MR-less spatial normalization for {[}18F]flortaucipir tau PET images.
   We use a deep neural network that estimates an aligning transformation
   from the PET input image, and outputs the spatially normalized image as
   well as the parameterized transformation. In order to do so, the
   proposed network iteratively estimates a set of rigid and affine
   transformations by means of convolutional neural network regressors as
   well as spatial transformer layers. The network is trained and validated
   on 199 tau PET volumes with corresponding ground truth transformations,
   and tested on two different datasets. The proposed method shows
   competitive performance in terms of registration accuracy as well as
   speed, and compares favourably to previously published results.}},

   been collected, 941 images for train data and 349 images for test
   images. Images collected at the centers were labeled age. In this paper,
   the Alexnet model is used in CNN architecture. The used architecture of
   the architecture has 5 Convolutional layers and 3 Sub-sampling layers

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease that results in

   We select thirty slices from the upper region of the brain, above the

   extract the best features of the selected region. After that, we put the

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative sickness. Recently, the
   end-to-end process of using neural networks to classify patterns has
   gradually replaced the tedious process of manually extracting features.
   The residual neural network (ResNet) can effectively avoid gradient
   explosion, gradient disappearance and network degradation. For AD, this
   paper attempts to apply ResNet to the diagnosis. Although the ResNet
   works better compared with the machine learning methods. However, the
   performance of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Control (NC)
   recognition is poor due to the insignificant difference in magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) brain image features. In this paper, the
   selective kernel network (SKNet) and channel shuffle are introduced in
   the Resnet network, and an enhanced Resnet (EResNet) is proposed to
   accurately diagnose the AD symptoms. The method solves the influence of
   the multiple scales of input information on the network through SKNet,
   and evenly disturbs the channel feature through the channel shuffle, so
   that the network can fully utilize the feature information of the input
   image to improve the network identification capability. To evaluate the
   performance of the EResNet, MRI images of the brain were used to
   diagnosis of AD. The classification accuracy in AD / MCI and MCI / NC
   control groups reached 96.47\% and 90.70\%. The experimental results
   show that the proposed model presents a good performance on AD
   classification.}},

   Latest advances of machine learning techniques grant another chance of

   exploring and designing new machine learning techniques towards
   multi-modality medical and health dataset for predicting occurrences and
   modeling progression of AD. This paper aims at giving a systemic survey

   progression modeling, and discuss the potential and limitations of these
   techniques in practical applications. We summarize three key techniques
   for modeling AD progression: multi-task model, time series model and
   deep learning. In particular, we discuss the basic structural elements
   of most representative multi-task learning algorithms, and analyze a
   multi-task disease prediction model based on longitudinal time. Lastly,

Abstract = {{In recent years, number of classification techniques for Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) have been developed that produced methods based on the use
   of hand-crafted machine learning and obscure deep learning models. This
   study proposed a new classification framework based on the combination
   of Unet-like 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multinomial
   logistic regression classifier, which learns the intra-slice for
   multi-class classification after the selection of the 3D positron
   emission tomography (PET) image into a sequence of 2D slices. The CNNs
   are performed to generate the attention features of the brain while the
   logistic regression incorporated to learn those specifically localized
   features of various classes for AD classification. At the end of the
   network, we used a average pooling layer before the softmax for
   four-class classification problem. It can efficiently generate a
   flexible class of transformations and that can be trained end-to-end by
   back propagation. The results indicated that the proposed multi-instance
   learning (MIL) learns region of interest (ROI) itself and thus that
   could help to efficiently identify the precise patterns for AD. The
   proposed combined Unet-like CNN with multinomial regression classifier
   approach achieved highest accuracy of 97.9\% and 96.7\% on the

   Finally the SVM classified the brain MRI images into healthy,

Abstract = {{Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a non-invasive clinical
   technique used for treatment of several neurological diseases such as

   always challenging to accurately adjust the electric field on different
   specific brain regions due to the requirement of several stimulation
   parameters' optimizations. A major factor of brain induced electric
   field is the inter-subject variability, therefore a computer simulation
   is frequently used to simulate different TMS setups using anatomical
   models generated from MR images of the examined subject. Human head
   models are generated by segmentation of MR images into different
   anatomical tissues with a uniform electric conductivity value for each
   tissue. This process is time-consuming and requires a special experience
   to segment a relatively large number of tissues.
   In this paper, we propose a deep convolution network for human head
   segmentation that is convenient for simulation of electrical field
   distribution, such as TMS. The proposed network is used to generate head

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease is a brain disorder which causes the malfunction of
   neurons. This disease can cause loss of brain function and dementia
   which can further damage memory, thought process and human behaviour.
   Regardless of being a worst disease, it has no cure. Only handful of
   classification strategies have been proposed in the literature that too
   with a small set of training images. Existing methods for the detection
   of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images make use of only certain
   selective subsets of data based on age, gender etc., and often rely on
   clinical data to aid in their classification. This paper proposes a
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for recognition and detection
   of Alzheimer's disease from MRI images, trained on the Open Access
   Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. CNNs are the most popular
   deep learning architectures used for image related problems in recent
   times. In addition to that, CNNs are also robust for classification,
   which eliminates the need to ignore certain subsets of data, and solely
   focus on the image data. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 80\%
   and can be expected to achieve even higher accuracy with a substantial
   increase in the amount of data provided for training. We have
   incorporated Keras library in the python environment for building

Abstract = {{Arguably, unsupervised learning plays a crucial role in the majority of
   algorithms for processing brain imaging. A recently introduced
   unsupervised approach Deep InfoMax (DIM) is a promising tool for
   exploring brain structure in a flexible non-linear way. In this paper,
   we investigate the use of variants of DIM in a setting of progression to
   Alzheimer's disease in comparison with supervised AlexNet and ResNet
   inspired convolutional neural networks. As a benchmark, we use a
   classification task between four groups: patients with stable, and
   progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI), with Alzheimer's disease,
   and healthy controls. Our dataset is comprised of 828 subjects from the
   Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our
   experiments highlight encouraging evidence of the high potential utility
   of DIM in future neuroimaging studies.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) leads to memory loss and impairment, which may
   cause further symptoms. It affects lives of patients seriously and is
   not curable, but early confirmation of AD may be helpful to start proper
   treatment so as to avoid further brain damage. Over the past decades,
   machine learning methods have been applied to the classification of AD
   with results based on manually prepared features and a classifier having
   a multiple-step architecture. Recently, with the development of deep
   learning, the end-to-end process of neural networks has been employed
   for pattern classification. In this paper, we focus on early diagnosis
   of AD based on convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) by using
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Image slices of gray matter and white
   matter from MRI have been used as the inputs for classification.
   Ensemble learning methods have been employed after the convolutional
   operations for improving the classification by combining outputs of deep
   learning classifiers {[}27]. Three base ConvNets were designed,
   implemented, and compared in this paper. Our method was evaluated based
   on a dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative for
   the early diagnosis of this illness. In particular, the accuracy rates
   of our classifications have reached up to 97.65\% for AD/mild cognitive
   impairment and 88.37\% for mild cognitive impairment/normal control.}},

Title = {{Brain Arrhythmias Induced by Amyloid Beta and Inflammation: Involvement
   in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Inflammation-related Pathologies}},
Journal = {{CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH}},

Volume = {{16}},

Pages = {{1108-1131}},
Abstract = {{A variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),
   involve amyloid beta (A beta) accumulation and/or neuroinflammation,
   which can alter synaptic and neural circuit functions. Consequently,
   these pathological conditions induce changes in neural network rhythmic
   activity (brain arrhythmias), which affects many brain functions. Neural
   network rhythms are involved in information processing, storage and
   retrieval, which are essential for memory consolidation, executive
   functioning and sensory processing. Therefore, brain arrhythmias could
   have catastrophic effects on circuit function, underlying the symptoms
   of various neurological diseases. Moreover, brain arrhythmias can serve
   as biomarkers for a variety of brain diseases. The aim of this review is
   to provide evidence linking AD and inflammation to neural network
   dysfunction, focusing on alterations in brain rhythms and their impact
   on cognition and sensory processing. I reviewed the most common brain
   arrhythmias characterized in AD, in AD transgenic models and those
   induced by A beta. In addition, I reviewed the modulations of brain
   rhythms in neuroinflammatory diseases and those induced by immunogens,
   interleukins and microglia. This review reveals that A beta and
   inflammation produce a complex set of effects on neural network
   function, which are related to the induction of brain arrhythmias and
   hyperexcitability, both closely related to behavioral alterations.
   Understanding these brain arrhythmias can help to develop therapeutic
   strategies to halt or prevent these neural network alterations and treat
   not only the arrhythmias but also the symptoms of AD and other
   inflammation-related pathologies.}},

Title = {{Uncovering convolutional neural network decisions for diagnosing
   multiple sclerosis on conventional MRI using layer-wise relevance
   propagation}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{24}},
Abstract = {{Machine learning-based imaging diagnostics has recently reached or even
   surpassed the level of clinical experts in several clinical domains.
   However, classification decisions of a trained machine learning system
   are typically non-transparent, a major hindrance for clinical
   integration, error tracking or knowledge discovery. In this study, we
   present a transparent deep learning framework relying on 3D
   convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise relevance
   propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), the most
   widespread autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease. MS is commonly
   diagnosed utilizing a combination of clinical presentation and
   conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically the
   occurrence and presentation of white matter lesions in T2-weighted
   images. We hypothesized that using LRP in a naive predictive model would
   enable us to uncover relevant image features that a trained CNN uses for
   decision-making. Since imaging markers in MS are well-established this
   would enable us to validate the respective CNN model. First, we
   pre-trained a CNN on MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (n = 921), afterwards specializing the CNN to discriminate
   between MS patients (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 71). Using LRP,
   we then produced a heatmap for each subject in the holdout set depicting
   the voxel-wise relevance for a particular classification decision. The
   resulting CNN model resulted in a balanced accuracy of 87.04\% and an
   area under the curve of 96.08\% in a receiver operating characteristic
   curve. The subsequent LRP visualization revealed that the CNN model
   focuses indeed on individual lesions, but also incorporates additional
   information such as lesion location, non-lesional white matter or gray
   matter areas such as the thalamus, which are established conventional
   and advanced MRI markers in MS. We conclude that LRP and the proposed
   framework have the capability to make diagnostic decisions of CNN models
   transparent, which could serve to justify classification decisions for
   clinical review, verify diagnosis-relevant features and potentially
   gather new disease knowledge.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus plays an indispensable role in episodic memory,
   particularly during the consolidation process. However, its precise role
   in retrieval of episodic memory is still ambiguous. In this study, we
   investigated the correlation of hippocampal morphometry and the
   performance in an autobiographical memory task in 27 healthy controls
   and 24 patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most
   importantly, correlations were defined separately and comparatively for
   memory contents with different retrieval frequency in the past. In
   healthy subjects, memory performance for seldom retrieved
   autobiographical events was significantly associated with gray matter
   density in the bilateral hippocampus, whereas this correlation was not
   present for events with high retrieval frequency. This pattern of
   findings confirms that retrieval frequency plays a critical role in the
   consolidation of episodic autobiographical memories, thereby making them
   more independent of the hippocampal system. In AD patients, on the other
   hand, successful memory retrieval appeared to be related to hippocampal
   morphometry irrespective of the contents' retrieval frequency,
   comprising events with high retrieval frequency, too. The observed
   differences between patients and control subjects suggest that
   AD-related neurodegeneration not only impairs the function, but also
   decreases the functional specialization of the hippocampal memory
   system, which, thus, may be considered as marker for AD.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)
   are representative disorders of dementia of the elderly and the
   neuroimaging has contributed to early diagnosis by estimation of
   alterations of brain volume, blood flow and metabolism. A brain network
   analysis by MR imaging (MR connectome) is a recently developed technique
   and can estimate the dysfunction of the brain network in AD and DLB. A
   graph theory which is a major technique of network analysis is useful
   for a group study to extract the feature of disorders, but is not
   necessarily suitable for the disorder differentiation at the individual
   level. In this investigation, we propose a deep learning technique as an
   alternative method of the graph analysis for recognition and
   classification of AD and DLB at the individual subject level.
   Materials and Methods: Forty-eight brain structural connectivity data of
   18 All, 8 DLB and 22 healthy controls were applied to the machine
   learning consisting of a six-layer convolution neural network (CNN)
   model. Estimation of the deep learning model to classify AD, DLB and
   non-AD/DLB was performed using the 4-fold cross-validation method.
   Results: The accuracy, average precision and recall of our CNN model
   were 0.73, 0.78 and 0.73, and the specificity precision and recall were
   0.68 and 0.79 in AD, 0.94 and 0.65 in DLB and 0.73 and 0.75 in
   non-AD/DLB. The triangular probability map of the MR connectome revealed
   the probability of AD, DLB and non-AD/DLB in each subject.
   Conclusion: Our preliminary investigation revealed the adaptation of
   deep learning to the MR connectome and proposed its utility in the
   differentiation of dementia disorders at the individual subject level.}},

   of the prerequisites for achieving good results in the domain of an
   automatic diagnostics is the size and quality of the training set. One
   of the most serious challenges in the domain of a medical image analysis
   is the lack of manually annotated data. In this work, we use a

   Based on a quantitative analysis of multiple techniques, we propose to
   use a specific set of data augmentation techniques to improve the
   generalization of the deep neural network model. The proposed approach
   was compared with three different approaches using the same neural
   network - one approach with no data augmentation, one with
   regularization not specific to visual data (dropout and weight decay)
   and one with extensive data augmentation specific for images. We

   this line of research. From our literature review, we realised that one
   of the current trends is using transfer learning for 2D convolutional
   neural networks to classify subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In this
   way, each 3D MRI volume is divided into 2D image slices and a
   pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network can be re-trained to
   classify image slices independently. One issue here, however, is that
   the 2D convolutional neural network would not be able to consider the
   relationship between 2D image slices in an MRI volume and make decisions
   on them independently. To address this issue, we propose to use a
   recurrent neural network after a convolutional neural network to
   understand the relationship between sequences of images for each subject
   and make a decision based on all input slices instead of each of the
   slices. Our results show that training the recurrent neural network on

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the intermediate stage
   between normal cerebral aging and dementia associated with Alzheimers
   disease (AD). Early diagnosis of MCI and AD through artificial
   intelligence has captured considerable scholarly interest; researchers
   hope to develop therapies capable of slowing or halting these processes.
   We developed a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm based on an
   optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) topology called MCADNNet
   that simultaneously recognizes MCI, AD, and normally aging brains in
   adults over the age of 75 years, using structural and functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Following highly detailed
   preprocessing, four-dimensional (4D) fMRI and 3D MRI were decomposed to
   create 2D images using a lossless transformation, which enables maximum
   preservation of data details. The samples were shuffled and
   subject-level training and testing datasets were completely independent.
   The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted invariant and
   hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by
   multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer. A
   decision-making algorithm was also designed to stabilize the outcome of
   the trained models. To measure the performance of classification, the
   accuracy rates for various pipelines were calculated before and after
   applying the decision-making algorithm. Accuracy rates of 99.77 0.36 and
   97.5 1.16 were achieved for MRI and fMRI pipelines, respectively, after
   applying the decision-making algorithm. In conclusion, a cutting-edge
   and optimized topology called MCADNNet was designed and preceded a
   preprocessing pipeline; this was followed by a decision-making step that
   yielded the highest performance achieved for simultaneous classification
   of the three cohorts examined.}},

Abstract = {{Objective and efficient diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has been a
   major topic with extensive researches in recent years, and some
   promising results have been shown for imaging markers using magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data. Beside conventional machine learning
   methods, deep learning based methods have been developed in several
   studies, where layer-by-layer neural network settings were purposed to
   extract features for disease classification from the patches or whole
   images. However, as the disease develops from subcortical nuclei to
   cortical regions, specific brain regions with morphological changes
   might contribute to the diagnosis of disease progress. Therefore, we
   propose a novel spatial and depth weighted neural network structure to
   extract effective features, and further improve the performance of AD
   diagnosis. Specifically, we first use group comparison to detect the
   most distinctive AD-related landmarks, and then sample landmark-based
   image patches as our training data. In the model structure, with a
   15-layer DenseNet as backbone, we introduce a attention bypass to
   estimate the spatial weights in the image space to guide the network to
   focus on specific regions. A squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanism is
   also adopted to further weight the feature map channels. We used 2335
   subjects from public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO) for
   experiment and results show that our framework achieves 90.02\%
   accuracy, 81.25\% sensitivity, and 96.33\% specificity in diagnosis AD

Abstract = {{We introduce a novel conditional generative model for unsupervised
   learning of anatomical shapes based on a conditional variational
   autoencoder (CVAE). Our model is specifically designed to learn latent,
   low-dimensional shape embeddings from point clouds of large datasets. By
   using a conditional framework, we are able to introduce side information
   to the model, leading to accurate reconstructions and providing a
   mechanism to control the generative process. Our network design provides
   invariance to similarity transformations and avoids the need to identify
   point correspondences between shapes. Contrary to previous
   discriminative approaches based on deep learning, our generative method
   does not only allow to produce shape descriptors from a point cloud, but
   also to reconstruct shapes from the embedding. We demonstrate the
   advantages of this approach by: (i) learning low-dimensional
   representations of the hippocampus and showing low reconstruction errors
   when projecting them back to the shape space, and (ii) demonstrating
   that synthetic point clouds generated by our model capture morphological
   differences associated to Alzheimer's disease, to the point that they
   can be used to train a discriminative model for disease classification.}},

Abstract = {{The increase in AD population calls for an automated and accurate method
   for efficiently diagnosing AD through MRI, preferably at the stage of
   Early MCI (EMCI). Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), ReLU, Dropout
   contribute to better performance of Artificial Neural Network (ANN),
   resulting in a considerable decline in error rates for computer vision
   tasks like MRI-based diagnosis through classification. CNN-based
   architectures such as AlexNet have become dominant in image
   classification challenges. VGG-like architectures emerged as improved
   variants of AlexNet but the large numbers of kernels and layers in VGG
   tend to slow down the training process. VoxCNN has been designed for
   binary AD/LMCI/EMCI/Normal classification of 3D MRI images,
   incorporating batch normalization, Dropout and Adam for training.
   Although VoxCNN output decent results with a relatively small dataset as
   input, the fact that 150 epochs have to be performed for each run of
   classification is prone to yield a lengthy training process. We tweaked
   Dropout probability and managed to reduce training time of VoxCNN by
   49\% while maintaining the same level of prediction performance in
   binary AD/LMCI/EMCI/Normal classification. Both ROC AUC and accuracy
   exhibited minor loss, i.e., 0.3\% and 1.4\%, respectively. Standard
   deviation of both ROC AUC and accuracy at Epoch 75 was improved on the
   whole after adjustment of Dropout probability.}},

Abstract = {{Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) aim to extend the data
   representation and classification capabilities of convolutional neural
   networks, which are highly effective for signals defined on regular
   Euclidean domains, e.g. image and audio signals, to irregular,
   graph-structured data defined on non-Euclidean domains. Graph-theoretic
   tools that enable us to study the brain as a complex system are of great
   significance in brain connectivity studies. Particularly, in the context
   of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated
   with network dysfunction, graph-based tools are vital for disease
   classification and staging. Here, we implement and test a multi-class
   GCNN classifier for network based classification of subjects on the AD
   spectrum into four categories: cognitively normal, early mild cognitive
   impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD. We train and
   validate the network using structural connectivity graphs obtained from
   diffusion tensor imaging data. Using receiver operating characteristic
   curves, we show that the GCNN classifier outperforms a support vector
   machine classifier by margins that are reliant on disease category. Our
   findings indicate that the performance gap between the two methods
   increases with disease progression from CN to AD. We thus demonstrate
   that GCNN is a competitive tool for staging and classification of
   subjects on the AD spectrum.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},

Volume = {{23}},
Abstract = {{Quantifying the degree of atrophy is done clinically by
   neuroradiologists following established visual rating scales. For these
   assessments to be reliable the rater requires substantial training and
   experience, and even then the rating agreement between two radiologists
   is not perfect. We have developed a model we call AVRA (Automatic Visual
   Ratings of Atrophy) based on machine learning methods and trained on
   2350 visual ratings made by an experienced neuroradiologist. It provides
   fast and automatic ratings for Scheltens' scale of medial temporal
   atrophy (MTA), the frontal subscale of Pasquier's Global Cortical
   Atrophy (GCA-F) scale, and Koedam's scale of Posterior Atrophy (PA). We
   demonstrate substantial inter-rater agreement between AVRA's and a
   neuroradiologist ratings with Cohen's weighted kappa values of kappa(w)
   = 0.74/0.72 (MTA left/right), kappa(w) = 0.62 (GCA-F) and kappa(w) =
   0.74 (PA). We conclude that automatic visual ratings of atrophy can

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{23}},
Abstract = {{Combining machine learning with neuroimaging data has a great potential
   for early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). However, it remains unclear how well the classifiers built
   on one population can predict MCI/AD diagnosis of other populations.
   This study aimed to employ a spectral graph convolutional neural network
   (graph-CNN), that incorporated cortical thickness and geometry, to
   identify MCI and AD based on 3089 T-1-weighted MRI data of the ADNI-2
   cohort, and to evaluate its feasibility to predict AD in the ADNI-1
   cohort (n = 3602) and an Asian cohort (n = 347). For the ADNI-2 cohort,
   the graph-CNN showed classification accuracy of controls (CN) vs. AD at
   85.8\% and early MCI (EMCI) vs. AD at 79.2\%, followed by CN vs. late
   MCI (LMCI) (69.3\%), LMCI vs. AD (65.2\%), EMCI vs. LMCI (60.9\%), and
   CN vs. EMCI (51.8\%). We demonstrated the robustness of the graph-CNN
   among the existing deep learning approaches, such as
   Euclidean-domain-based multilayer network and 1D CNN on cortical
   thickness, and 2D and 3D CNNs on T-1-weighted MR images of the ADNI-2
   cohort. The graph-CNN also achieved the prediction on the conversion of
   EMCI to AD at 75\% and that of LMCI to AD at 92\%. The find-tuned
   graph-CNN further provided a promising CN vs. AD classification accuracy
   of 89.4\% on the ADNI-1 cohort and > 90\% on the Asian cohort. Our study
   demonstrated the feasibility to transfer AD/MCI classifiers learned from
   one population to the other. Notably, incorporating cortical geometry in
   CNN has the potential to improve classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Background: We propose a classification method for Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) based on the texture of the hippocampus, which is the organ that is
   most affected by the onset of AD.
   Methods: We obtained magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of Alzheimer's
   patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   dataset. This dataset consists of image data for AD, mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NCs), classified according to the
   cognitive condition. In this study, the research methods included image
   processing, texture analyses, and deep learning. Firstly, images were
   acquired for texture analyses, which were then re-spaced, registered,
   and cropped with Gabor filters applied to the resulting image data. In
   the texture analyses, we applied the 3-dimensional (3D) gray-level
   co-occurrence (GLCM) method to evaluate the textural features of the
   image, and used Fisher's coefficient to select the appropriate features
   for classification. In the last stage, we implemented a deep learning
   multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model, which we divided into three types,
   namely, AD-MCI, AD-NC, and MCI-NC.
   Results: We used this model to assess the accuracy of the proposed
   method. The classification accuracy of the proposed deep learning model
   was confirmed in the cases of AD-MCI (72.5\%), ADNC (85\%), and MCI-NC
   (75\%). We also evaluated the results obtained using a confusion matrix,
   support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier
   and analyzed the results to objectively verify our model. We obtained
   the highest accuracy of 85\% in the AD-NC.
   Conclusion: The proposed model was at least 6-19\% more accurate than
   the SVM and KNN classifiers, respectively. Hence, this study confirms
   the validity and superiority of the proposed method, which can be used
   as a diagnostic tool for early Alzheimer's diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive malfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and disconnections in
   neural networks are core deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 5xFAD
   mice, a transgenic model of AD, are characterized by an enhanced level
   of amyloid-beta and abnormal neurotransmission. The dopaminergic (DA)
   system has been shown to be involved in amyloid-beta transformations and
   neuronal plasticity; however, its role in functional network changes in
   familial AD still remains unclear. In 5xFAD and non-transgenic freely
   moving mice, electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded
   from the secondary motor cortex (MC), superficial layers of the
   hippocampal CA1 area (HPC), substantia nigra (SN), and ventral tegmental
   area (VTA). EEGs and their frequency spectra were analyzed before and
   after systemic injection of a DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO). In
   the baseline EEG from MC and HPC of 5xFAD mice, delta and alpha
   oscillations were enhanced and beta activity was attenuated, compared to
   control mice. In VTA and SN of 5xFAD mice, delta-theta activity was
   decreased and beta oscillations dominated. In control mice, APO
   suppressed delta activity in VTA to a higher extent than in MC, whereas
   in 5xFAD mice, this difference was eliminated due to attenuation of the
   delta suppression in VTA. APO increased beta activity in MC of mice from
   both groups while significant beta suppression was observed in VTA of
   5xFAD mice. These mice were characterized by significant decrease of
   tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in both VTA and SN and of DA
   transporter in MC and hippocampal dentate gyrus. We suggest that the EEG
   modifications observed in 5xFAD mice are associated with alterations in
   dopaminergic transmission, resulting in adaptive changes in the cerebral
   networks in the course of familial AD development.}},

Abstract = {{There is ongoing research for the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's

   learning-based approaches are becoming a popular choice for AD
   diagnosis. The state-of-the-art techniques that consider multimodal
   diagnosis have been shown to have accuracy better than a manual
   diagnosis. However, collecting data from different modalities is
   time-consuming and expensive, and some modalities may have radioactive
   side effects. Our study is confined to structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (sMRI). The objectives of our attempt are as follows: 1) to
   increase the accuracy level that is comparable to the state-of-the-art
   methods; 2) to overcome the overfitting problem, and; 3) to analyze
   proven landmarks of the brain that provide discernible features for AD
   diagnosis. Here, we focused specifically on both the left and right
   hippocampus areas. To achieve the objectives, at first, we incorporate
   ensembles of simple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as feature
   extractors and softmax cross-entropy as the classifier. Then,
   considering the scarcity of data, we deployed a patch-based approach. We
   have performed our experiment on the Gwangju Alzheimer's and Related

Title = {{Hippocampus Localization Using a Two-Stage Ensemble Hough Convolutional
   Neural Network}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{73436-73447}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a two-stage ensemble-based approach to
   localize the anatomical structure of interest from magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scans. We combine a Hough voting method with a
   convolutional neural network to automatically localize brain anatomical
   structures such as the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the
   regions that can be affected by the Alzheimer's disease, and this region
   is known to be related to memory loss. The structural changes of the
   hippocampus are important biomarkers for dementia. To analyze the
   structural changes, accurate localization plays a vital role.
   Furthermore, for segmentation and registration of anatomical structures,
   exact localization is desired. Our proposed models use a deep
   convolutional neural network (CNN) to calculate displacement vectors by
   exploiting the Hough voting strategy from multiple 3-viewpoint patch
   samples. The displacement vectors are added to the sample position to
   estimate the target position. To efficiently learn from samples, we
   employed a local and global strategy. The multiple global models were
   trained using randomly selected 3-viewpoint patches from the whole MRI
   scan. The results from global models are aggregated to obtain global
   predictions. Similarly, we trained multiple local models, extracting
   patches from the vicinity of the hippocampus location and assembling
   them to obtain a local prediction. The proposed models exploit the
   Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset and the
   Gwangju Alzheimer's and related dementia (GARD) cohort MRI dataset for
   training, validating and testing. The average prediction error using the
   proposed two-stage ensemble Hough convolutional neural network
   (Hough-CNN) models are 2.32 and 2.25 mm for the left and right
   hippocampi, respectively, for 65 test MRIs from the GARD cohort dataset.
   Similarly, for the ADNI MRI dataset, the average prediction error for
   the left and right hippocampi are 2.31 and 2.04 mm, respectively, for 56
   MRI scans.}},

   in a Novel Locus Coeruleus Tau-Seeding Mouse Model of Alzheimer's
   Disease}},
Journal = {{NEURAL PLASTICITY}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{2019}},
Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease
   characterized by loss of synapses and disrupted functional connectivity
   (FC) across different brain regions. Early in AD progression, tau
   pathology is found in the locus coeruleus (LC) prior to amyloid-induced
   exacerbation of clinical symptoms. Here, a tau-seeding model in which
   preformed synthetic tau fibrils (K18) were unilaterally injected into
   the LC of P301L mice, equipped with multichannel electrodes for
   recording EEG in frontal cortical and CA1-CA3 hippocampal areas, was
   used to longitudinally quantify over 20 weeks of functional network
   dynamics in (1) power spectra; (2) FC using intra- and intersite
   phase-amplitude theta-gamma coupling (PAC); (3) coherence, partial
   coherence, and global coherent network efficiency (Eglob) estimates; and
   (4) the directionality of functional connectivity using extended partial
   direct coherence (PDC). A sustained leftward shift in the theta peak
   frequency was found early in the power spectra of hippocampal CA1
   networks ipsilateral to the injection site. Strikingly, hippocampal CA1
   coherence and Eglob measures were impaired in K18-treated animals.
   Estimation of instantaneous EEG amplitudes revealed deficiency in the
   propagation directionality of gamma oscillations in the CA1 circuit.
   Impaired PAC strength evidenced by decreased modulation of the theta
   frequency phase on gamma frequency amplitude further confirms
   impairments of the neural CA1 network. The present results demonstrate
   early dysfunctional hippocampal networks, despite no spreading tau
   pathology to the hippocampus and frontal cortex. The ability of the K18
   seed in the brainstem LC to elicit such robust functional alterations in
   distant hippocampal structures in the absence of pathology challenges
   the classic view that tau pathology spread to an area is necessary to
   elicit functional impairments in that area.}},

Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},

Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{72726-72735}},
Abstract = {{Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI
   through machine learning has been a subject of intense research in
   recent years. The recent success of deep learning in computer vision has
   progressed such research. However, common limitations with such
   algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and the
   requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep
   networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer
   learning, where the state-ofthe-art VGG architecture is initialized with
   pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural
   images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where
   only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink
   the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most
   informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show
   that with the training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other
   contemporary methods, we reach the state-of-the-art performance in AD
   vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4\%
   and a 7\% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI
   and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide a detailed analysis of the
   effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the
   training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned.
   Finally, we provide class activation maps (CAM) that demonstrate how the
   proposed model focuses on discriminative image regions that are
   neuropathologically relevant and can help the healthcare practitioner in
   interpreting the model's decision-making process.}},

Title = {{Identification of Early Vascular Dementia Patients With EEG Signal}},
Journal = {{IEEE ACCESS}},
Year = {{2019}},
Volume = {{7}},
Pages = {{68618-68627}},
Abstract = {{Effort has been made to find biomarkers for vascular dementia (VaD).
   Nevertheless, the current findings are typically obtained through
   statistical tests of group level differences. In clinical practice,
   however, it is more common to perform individual level inferences, e.g.,
   to determine if a subject is suffering from VaD, which cannot be
   resolved with statistical analysis. The goal of this study is to develop
   a method to effectively discriminate early VaD patients from normal
   controls by combining EEG features with machine learning methods. The
   EEG signals were recorded from a total of 15 VaD patients and 21
   controls during a visual oddball task. Interregional directed
   connectivity was derived from directed transfer function (DTF) analysis
   and used as features in classification. Three machine learning methods,
   including linear discriminant analyais (LDA), error back-propagation
   (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) were used as
   classifiers, and their classification performance was compared. It was
   found that VaD patients can be effectively identified using the BP and
   SVM classifiers with high accuracy. In particular, when the SVM
   classifier was combined with feature selection by Fisher score, it
   reached an accuracy 86.11\%, sensitivity 86.67\%, and specificity
   85.71\%. The area under the curve (AUC, 0.854) indicates a good
   identification of VaD patients from the normal controls. Since the EEG
   is noninvasive, inexpensive, and widely available to use, the current
   study presents a novel clinical application of machine learning methods
   and could facilitate automatic screening and diagnosis of the VaD at an
   early stage in future.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible progressive
   neurodegenerative disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the
   prodromal state of AD, which is further classified into a progressive
   state (i.e., pMCI) and a stable state (i.e., sMCI). With the development
   of deep learning, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made
   great progress in image recognition using magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) for AD diagnosis. However,
   due to the limited availability of these imaging data, it is still
   challenging to effectively use CNNs for AD diagnosis. Toward this end,
   we design a novel deep learning framework. Specifically, the virtues of
   3D-CNN and fully stacked bidirectional long short-term memory
   (FSBi-LSTM) are exploited in our framework. First, we design a 3D-CNN
   architecture to derive deep feature representation from both MRI and
   PET. Then, we apply FSBi-LSTM on the hidden spatial information from
   deep feature maps to further improve its performance. Finally, we
   validate our method on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset.
   Our method achieves average accuracies of 94.82\%, 86.36\%, and 65.35\%
   for differentiating AD from normal control (NC), pMCI from NC, and sMCI
   from NC, respectively, and outperforms the related algorithms in the

   wavelet energy distribution in each sub-band is calculated and used as a

   the feature set with ANN. The method was tested on EEG data sets
   obtained from that belongs to three subject groups: (a) healthy, (b)
   seizure-free interval, and (c) epileptic syndrome during a seizure. The

Abstract = {{Objective To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients
   with narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in
   patients with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral
   spinal fluid (CSF) markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and
   cognitive profile. Methods Cognitive and F-18-florbetapir positron
   emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged
   >= 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of
   clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's
   Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized
   uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of
   interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio
   normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a
   composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio >= 1.17 defined
   positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed
   in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean
   cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 +/- 0.15, 1.11 +/- 0.18 {[}p <
   0.0001], and 1.14 +/- 0.17 {[}p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar
   results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all
   cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1
   (4.4\%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5\% in the ADNI and
   30.4\% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional
   amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or
   neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden,
   assessed by F-18-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed
   appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:74-83.}},

Abstract = {{Here, we tested that healthy elderly (Nold) and Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   individuals can be discriminated with a moderate accuracy using resting
   state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) markers. Eyes-closed
   rsEEG data were collected in 100 Nold and 120 AD subjects. eLORETA
   freeware estimated the source current density (SCD) and functional
   connectivity (lagged linear connectivity, LLC) in frontal, central,
   parietal, occipital, temporal, and limbic regions. Delta (2-4 Hz), theta
   (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), and alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz) were the
   frequency bands of interest. Univariate (i.e., single rsEEG marker with
   receiver operating characteristic, ROC, curve) and multivariate (i.e.,
   multiple rsEEG markers with artificial neural networks, ANNs)
   classifiers were used. The best accuracy was of 76\% with univariate
   classifiers and 77\% with multiple classifiers. The present results
   suggest that both univariate and multivariate rsEEG classifiers allowed
   a moderate classification rate between Nold and AD individuals.
   Interestingly, the accuracy based on multiple rsEEG markers as inputs to
   ANNs was similar to that obtained with a single rsEEG marker, unveiling
   their information redundancy for classification purposes. In future AD
   studies, multiple rsEEG markers should also include other classes of
   independent linear (i.e. directed transfer function) and nonlinear (i.e.
   entropy) variables to improve the classification.}},

   dedicated to a specific cognitive function are spatially clustered and

   segregation. However, it is not well known that such a local segregation
   is associated with sub-networks which may act as building blocks of
   brain networks. In this work, we used machine learning techniques to
   analyze brain networks. Specifically, using an auto-encoder and a graph
   auto-encoder, we decomposed brain networks into several essential
   building blocks, and compared their results through various measures of

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised pre-training method to

   to typical deep learning tasks, the size of the resting-state functional
   Magnetic Resonance Image (rs-fMRI) datasets for training is limited.
   Thus, the available data should be very efficiently used to learn the
   complex patterns underneath the brain connectivity dynamics. To address
   this issue, we use residual connections to alleviate the training
   complexity through recurrent multi-scale representation and pre-training
   the architecture unsupervised way. We conduct two classification tasks
   to differentiate early and late stage Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
   from Normal healthy Control (NC) subjects. The experiments verify that
   our proposed residual D-net indeed learns the brain connectivity
   dynamics, leading to significantly higher classification accuracy

Abstract = {{Machine learning and pattern recognition have been widely investigated
   in order to look for the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   However, most existing methods extract features by seed-based
   correlation, which not only requires prior information but also ignores
   the relationship between resting state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) voxels. In this study, we proposed a deep learning
   classification framework with multivariate data-driven based feature
   extraction for automatic diagnosis of AD. Specifically, a three-level
   hierarchical partner matching independent components analysis
   (3LHPM-ICA) approach was proposed first in order to address the issues
   in spatial individual ICA, including the uncertainty of the numbers of
   components, the randomness of initial values, and the correspondence of
   ICs of multiple subjects, resulting in stable and reliable ICs which
   were applied as the intrinsic brain functional connectivity (FC)
   features. Second, Granger causality (GC) was utilized to infer
   directional interaction between the ICs that were identified by the
   3LHPM-ICA method and extract the effective connectivity features.
   Finally, a deep learning classification framework was developed to
   distinguish AD from controls by fusing the functional and effective
   connectivities. A resting state fMRI dataset containing 34 AD patients
   and 34 normal controls (NCs) was applied to the multivariate deep
   learning platform, leading to a classification accuracy of 95.59\%, with
   a sensitivity of 97.06\% and a specificity of 94.12\% with leave-one-out
   cross validation (LOOCV). The experimental results demonstrated that the
   measures of neural connectivities of ICA and GC followed by deep
   learning classification represented the most powerful methods of
   distinguishing AD clinical data from NCs, and these aberrant brain
   connectivities might serve as robust brain biomarkers for AD. This
   approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to classify other
   psychiatric disorders.}},

Abstract = {{According to the network-based neurodegeneration hypothesis,
   neurodegenerative diseases target specific large-scale neural networks,
   such as the default mode network, and may propagate along the structural
   and functional connections within and between these brain networks.
   Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) represents an early prodromal
   stage but few studies have examined brain topological changes within and
   between brain structural and functional networks. To this end, we
   studied the structural networks {[}diffusion magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI)] and functional networks (task-free functional MRI) in CIND (61
   mild, 56 moderate) and healthy older adults (97 controls). Structurally,
   compared with controls, moderate CIND had lower global efficiency, and
   lower nodal centrality and nodal efficiency in the thalamus, somatomotor
   network, and higher-order cognitive networks. Mild CIND only had higher
   nodal degree centrality in dorsal parietal regions. Functional
   differences were more subtle, with both CIND groups showing lower nodal
   centrality and efficiency in temporal and somatomotor regions.
   Importantly, CIND generally had higher structural-functional connectome
   correlation than controls. The higher structural-functional topological
   similarity was undesirable as higher correlation was associated with
   poorer verbal memory, executive function, and visuoconstruction. Our
   findings highlighted the distinct and progressive changes in brain
   structural-functional networks at the prodromal stage of

Title = {{Prediction of Autopsy Verified Neuropathological Change of Alzheimer's
   Disease Using Machine Learning and MRI}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of
   dementia. While neuropathological changes pathognomonic for AD have been
   defined, early detection of AD prior to cognitive impairment in the
   clinical setting is still lacking. Pioneer studies applying machine
   learning to magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD have yielded high accuracies, however,
   an algorithm predicting neuropathological change is still lacking. The
   objective of this study was to compute a prediction model supporting a
   more distinct diagnostic criterium for AD compared to clinical
   presentation, allowing identification of hallmark changes even before
   symptoms occur.
   Methods: Autopsy verified neuropathological changes attributed to AD, as
   described by a combined score for 4-peptides, neurofibrillary tangles
   and neuritic plaques issued by the National Institute on Aging -
   Alzheimer's Association (NIAA), the ABC score for AD, were predicted
   from structural MRI data with RandomForest (RF). MRI scans were
   performed at least 2 years prior to death. All subjects derive from the
   prospective Vienna Trans-Danube Aging (VITA) study that targeted all
   1750 inhabitants of the age of 75 in the starting year of 2000 in two
   districts of Vienna and included irregular follow-ups until death,
   irrespective of clinical symptoms or diagnoses. For 68 subjects MRI as
   well as neuropathological data were available and 49 subjects (mean age
   at death: 82.8 +/- 2.9, 29 female) with sufficient MRI data quality were
   enrolled for further statistical analysis using nested cross-validation
   (CV). The decoding data of the inner loop was used for variable
   selection and parameter optimization with a fivefold CV design, the new
   data of the outer loop was used for model validation with optimal
   settings in a fivefold CV design. The whole procedure was performed ten
   times and average accuracies with standard deviations were reported.
   Results: The most informative ROls included caudal and rostral anterior
   cingulate gyrus, entorhinal, fusiform and insular cortex and the
   subcortical ROls anterior corpus callosum and the left vessel, a ROI
   comprising lacunar alterations in inferior putamen and pallidum. The
   resulting prediction models achieved an average accuracy for a three
   leveled NIAA AD score of 0.62 within the decoding sets and of 0.61 for
   validation sets. Higher accuracies of 0.77 for both sets, respectively,
   were achieved when predicting presence or absence of neuropathological
   change.
   Conclusion: Computer-aided prediction of neuropathological change
   according to the categorical NIAA score in AD, that currently can only
   be assessed post-mortem, may facilitate a more distinct and definite
   categorization of AD dementia. Reliable detection of neuropathological
   hallmarks of AD would enable risk stratification at an earlier level
   than prediction of MCI or clinical AD symptoms and advance precision

Abstract = {{An accurate and reliable brain partition atlas is vital to
   quantitatively investigate the structural and functional abnormalities
   in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), generally considered to be a
   prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we proposed an
   automated structural classification method to identify MCI from healthy
   controls (HC) and investigated whether the classification performance
   was dependent on the brain parcellation schemes, including Automated
   Anatomical Labeling (AAL-90) atlas, Brainnetome (BN-246) atlas, and
   AAL-1024 atlas. In detail, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI)
   data of 69 MCI patients and 63 HC matched well on gender, age, and
   education level were collected and analyzed with voxel-based morphometry
   method first, then the volume features of every region of interest (ROI)
   belonging to the above-mentioned three atlases were calculated and
   compared between MCI and HC groups, respectively. At last, the abnormal
   volume features were selected as the classification features for a
   proposed support vector machine based identification method. After the
   leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate the classification
   performance, our results reported accuracies of 83, 92, and 89\% with
   AAL-90, BN-246, and AAL-1024 atlas, respectively, suggesting that future
   studies should pay more attention to the selection of brain partition
   schemes in the atlas-based studies. Furthermore, the consistent atrophic
   brain regions among three atlases were predominately located at
   bilateral hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal, bilateral amygdala,
   bilateral cingulate gyrus, left angular gyrus, right superior frontal
   gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and left

Abstract = {{In healthcare sector, it is of crucial importance to accurately diagnose
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prophase called mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) so as to prevent degeneration and provide early
   treatment for AD patients. In this paper, a framework is proposed for
   the diagnosis of AD, which consists of MRI images preprocessing, feature
   extraction, principal component analysis, and the support vector machine
   (SVM) model. In particular, a new switching delayed particle swarm
   optimization (SDPSO) algorithm is proposed to optimize the SVM
   parameters. The developed framework based on the SDPSO-SVM model is
   successfully applied to the classification of AD and MCI using MRI scans
   from ADNI dataset. Our developed algorithm can achieve excellent
   classification accuracies for 6 typical cases. Furthermore, experiment
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms several SVM
   models and also two other state-of-art methods with deep learning
   embedded, thereby serving as an effective AD diagnosis method. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder
   with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions.
   Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) play important role to
   evaluate the brain anatomical changes for AD Diagnosis. Machine learning
   technologies have been widely studied on MRI computation and analysis
   for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis of AD. Most
   existing methods extract the hand-craft features after image processing
   such as registration and segmentation, and then train a classifier to
   distinguish AD subjects from other groups. Motivated by the success of
   deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a
   classification method based on multiple cluster dense convolutional
   neural networks (DenseNets) to learn the various local features of MR
   brain images, which are combined for AD classification. First, we
   partition the whole brain image into different local regions and extract
   a number of 3D patches from each region. Second, the patches from each
   region are grouped into different clusters with the K-Means clustering
   method. Third, we construct a DenseNet to learn the patch features for
   each cluster and the features learned from the discriminative clusters
   of each region are ensembled for classification. Finally, the
   classification results from different local regions are combined to
   enhance final image classification. The proposed method can gradually
   learn the MRI features from the local patches to global image level for
   the classification task. There are no rigid registration and
   segmentation required for preprocessing MRI images. Our method is
   evaluated using T1-weighted MRIs of 831 subjects including 199 AD
   patients, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 229 normal control
   (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an
   accuracy of 89.5\% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.4\% for
   AD vs. NC classification, and an accuracy of 73.8\% and an AUC of 77.5\%
   for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the promising
   classification performances. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Title = {{Detection of white matter lesion regions in MRI using SLICO and

Abstract = {{Background and Objective: White matter lesions are non-static brain
   lesions that have a prevalence rate up to 98\% in the elderly
   population. Because they may be associated with several brain diseases,
   it is important that they are detected as soon as possible. Magnetic
   Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides three-dimensional data with the
   possibility to detect and emphasize contrast differences in soft
   tissues, providing rich information about the human soft tissue anatomy.
   However, the amount of data provided for these images is far too much
   for manual analysis/interpretation, representing a difficult and
   time-consuming task for specialists. This work presents a computational
   methodology capable of detecting regions of white matter lesions of the
   brain in MRI of FLAIR modality. The techniques highlighted in this
   methodology are SLICO clustering for candidate segmentation and
   convolutional neural networks for candidate classification.
   Methods: The methodology proposed here consists of four steps: (1)
   images acquisition, (2) images pre-processing, (3) candidates
   segmentation and (4) candidates classification.
   Results: The methodology was applied on 91 magnetic resonance images
   provided by DASA, and achieved an accuracy of 98.73\%, specificity of
   98.77\% and sensitivity of 78.79\% with 0.005 of false positives,
   without any false positives reduction technique, in detection of white
   matter lesion regions.
   Conclusions: It is demonstrated the feasibility of the analysis of brain
   MRI using SLICO and convolutional neural network techniques to achieve
   success in detection of white matter lesions regions. (C) 2018 Elsevier

   Is Preprocessing Needed?}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Spatial and intensity normalizations are nowadays a prerequisite for
   neuroimaging analysis. Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate
   comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied
   to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging
   modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in
   Parkinson's disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity
   normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and
   furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the
   information contained in them. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for
   their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and
   have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation,
   size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs
   account for spatial and intensity differences when analyzing nuclear
   brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalizations still needed? To
   answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on
   well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and
   intensity normalization preprocessings. The results show that a
   sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the
   ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a
   diagnosis accuracy of 94.1\% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984.
   The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these
   models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the
   literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial
   normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization and its
   type - is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of
   the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted.}},

Abstract = {{We developed a kernelled support tensor machine (KSTM)-based model with
   tumor tensors derived from pre-treatment PET and CT imaging as input to
   predict distant failure in early stage non-small cell lung cancer
   (NSCLC) treated with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). The
   patient cohort included 110 early stage NSCLC patients treated with
   SBRT, 25 of whom experienced failure at distant sites. Three-dimensional
   tumor tensors were constructed and used as input for the KSTM-based
   classifier. A KSTM iterative algorithm with a convergent proof was
   developed to train the weight vectors for every mode of the tensor for
   the classifier. In contrast to conventional radiomics approaches that
   rely on handcrafted imaging features, the KSTM-based classifier uses 3D
   imaging as input, taking full advantage of the imaging information. The
   KSTM-based classifier preserves the intrinsic 3D geometry structure of
   the medical images and the correlation in the original images and trains
   the classification hyper-plane in an adaptive feature tensor space. The
   KSTM-based predictive algorithm was compared with three conventional
   machine learning models and three radiomics approaches. For PET and CT,
   the KSTM-based predictive method achieved the highest prediction results

Volume = {{12}},
Month = {{NOV 5}},
Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Identifying MCI subjects who are at high risk of
   converting to AD is crucial for effective treatments. In this study, a
   deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is
   designed to accurately predict MCI-to-AD conversion with magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) data. First, MRI images are prepared with
   age-correction and other processing. Second, local patches, which are
   assembled into 2.5 dimensions, are extracted from these images. Then,
   the patches from AD and normal controls (NC) are used to train a CNN to
   identify deep learning features of MCI subjects. After that, structural
   brain image features are mined with FreeSurfer to assist CNN. Finally,
   both types of features are fed into an extreme learning machine
   classifier to predict the AD conversion. The proposed approach is
   validated on the standardized MRI datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. This approach achieves an
   accuracy of 79.9\% and an area under the receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 86.1\% in leave-one-out cross validations.
   Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed one
   outperforms others with higher accuracy and AUC, while keeping a good
   balance between the sensitivity and specificity. Results demonstrate
   great potentials of the proposed CNN-based approach for the prediction
   of MCI-to-AD conversion with solely MRI data. Age correction and
   assisted structural brain image features can boost the prediction
   performance of CNN.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, a number of new products introduced to the global
   market combine intelligent robotics, artificial intelligence and smart
   interfaces to provide powerful tools to support professional decision
   making. However, while brain disease diagnosis from the brain scan
   images is supported by imaging robotics, the data analysis to form a
   medical diagnosis is performed solely by highly trained medical
   professionals. Recent advances in medical imaging techniques, artificial
   intelligence, machine learning and computer vision present new
   opportunities to build intelligent decision support tools to aid the
   diagnostic process, increase the disease detection accuracy, reduce
   error, automate the monitoring of patient's recovery, and discover new
   knowledge about the disease cause and its treatment. This article
   introduces the topic of medical diagnosis of brain diseases from the MRI
   based images. We describe existing, multi-modal imaging techniques of
   the brain's soft tissue and describe in detail how are the resulting
   images are analyzed by a radiologist to form a diagnosis. Several
   comparisons between the best results of classifying natural scenes and
   medical image analysis illustrate the challenges of applying existing
   image processing techniques to the medical image analysis domain. The
   survey of medical image processing methods also identified several
   knowledge gaps, the need for automation of image processing analysis,
   and the identification of the brain structures in the medical images
   that differentiate healthy tissue from a pathology. This survey is
   grounded in the cases of brain tumor analysis and the traumatic brain
   injury diagnoses, as these two case studies illustrate the vastly
   different approaches needed to define, extract, and synthesize
   meaningful information from multiple MRI image sets for a diagnosis.
   Finally, the article summarizes artificial intelligence frameworks that
   are built as multi-stage, hybrid, hierarchical information processing
   work-flows and the bene fits of applying these models for medical
   diagnosis to build intelligent physician's aids with knowledge
   transparency, expert knowledge embedding, and increased analytical
   quality.}},

Abstract = {{Feature representations extracted from hippocampus in magnetic resonance
   (MR) images are widely used in computer-aided Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   diagnosis, and thus accurate segmentation for the hippocampus has been
   remaining an active research topic. Previous studies for hippocampus
   segmentation require either human annotation which is tedious and
   error-prone or pre-processing MR images via time-consuming non-linear
   registration. Although many automatic segmentation approaches have been
   proposed, their performance is often limited by the small size of
   hippocampus and complex confounding information around the hippocampus.
   In particular, human-engineered features extracted from segmented
   hippocampus regions (e.g., the volume of the hippocampus) are essential
   for brain disease diagnosis, while these features are independent of
   diagnosis models, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these
   issues, we propose a multi-task deep learning (MDL) method for joint
   hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression using MR images.
   The prominent advantages of our MDL method lie on that we don't need any
   time-consuming non-linear registration for pre-processing MR images, and
   features generated by MDL are consistent with subsequent diagnosis
   models. Specifically, we first align all MR images onto a standard
   template, followed by a patch extraction process to approximately locate
   hippocampus regions in the template space. Using image patches as input
   data, we develop a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for
   joint hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression. The
   proposed CNN network contains two subnetworks, including 1) a U-Net with
   a Dice-like loss function for hippocampus segmentation, and 2) a
   convolutional neural network with a mean squared loss function for
   clinical regression. Note that these two subnetworks share a part of
   network parameters, to exploit the inherent association between these
   two tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on 407 subjects with MRI data
   from baseline Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. The experimental results suggest that our MDL method achieves
   promising results in both tasks of hippocampus segmentation and clinical
   score regression, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.}},

Abstract = {{Objective Methods We investigated the association of plasma amyloid beta
   (Abeta)40, Abeta42, and total tau (tTau) with the presence of Alzheimer
   pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with subjective
   cognitive decline (SCD). We included 248 subjects with SCD (61 +/- 9
   years, 42\% female, Mini-Mental State Examination = 28 +/- 2) from the
   SCIENCe project and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Subjects were
   dichotomized as amyloid abnormal by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and
   positron emission tomography (PET). Baseline plasma Abeta40, Abeta42,
   and tTau were measured using Simoa technology. Associations between
   plasma levels and amyloid status were assessed using logistic regression
   analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Association of
   plasma levels with risk of clinical progression to mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) or dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard
   models. Results Interpretation Fifty-seven (23\%) subjects were
   CSF-amyloid abnormal. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and plasma Abeta42
   alone, but not tTau, identified abnormal CSF-amyloid status (plasma
   ratio: area under the curve {[}AUC] = 77\%, 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI] = 69-84\%; plasma Abeta42: AUC = 66\%, 95\% CI: 58-74\%).
   Combining plasma ratio with age and apolipoprotein E resulted in AUC =
   83\% (95\% CI = 77-89\%). The Youden cutoff of the plasma ratio gave a
   sensitivity of 76\% and specificity of 75\%, and applying this as a
   prescreener would reduce the number of lumbar punctures by 51\%. Using
   PET as outcome, a comparable reduction in number of PET scans would be
   achieved when applying the plasma ratio as prescreener. In addition, low
   plasma ratio was associated with clinical progression to MCI or dementia
   (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95\% CI = 1.4-2.3). Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio
   has potential as a prescreener to identify Alzheimer pathological
   changes in cognitively normal individuals with SCD. Ann Neurol

Abstract = {{Objective Methods Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron
   emission tomography (PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to
   measure the association of systemic vascular health with brain health
   after accounting for the impact of Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies.
   We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health-related magnetic
   resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural
   integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular
   health. We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n
   = 1,035) of individuals, aged >= 60 years, along the cognitive continuum
   with imaging from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of
   Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing
   cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records
   (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery
   disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using
   multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and
   brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD
   burden (from amyloid and tau PET). Results Interpretation Systemic
   vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning,
   widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity
   in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix.
   Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the
   genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal
   cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and
   independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance
   above and beyond amyloid deposition. Systemic vascular health has
   significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying
   prodromal cerebrovascular health-related brain measures that are
   independent of AD pathology-related changes has great utility for
   cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713-724}},

Abstract = {{Objective Methods To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity,
   defined by positron emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   biomarkers and/or neuropathological examination, in primary progressive
   aphasia (PPA) variants. We conducted a meta-analysis with individual
   participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including
   logopenic {[}lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent {[}nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic
   {[}svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable {[}n = 74] variants of PPA)
   from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-beta pathology (CSF {[}n =
   600], PET {[}n = 366], and/or autopsy {[}n = 378]) available. The
   estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant,
   age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon 4 status was determined using
   generalized estimating equation models. Results Interpretation
   Amyloid-beta positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86\%) than in
   nfvPPA (20\%) or svPPA (16\%; p < 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-beta
   positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10\% at age 50 years to
   27\% at age 80 years, p < 0.01) and svPPA (from 6\% at age 50 years to
   32\% at age 80 years, p < 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across
   PPA variants, ApoE epsilon 4 carriers were more often amyloid-beta
   positive (58.0\%) than noncarriers (35.0\%, p < 0.001). Autopsy data
   revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic
   diagnosis in lvPPA (76\%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in
   svPPA (80\%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA
   (64\%). This study shows that the current PPA classification system
   helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and
   clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be
   considered when interpreting amyloid-beta biomarkers in PPA patients.

   present an automatic method to segment these lesions based on an

   its overcomplete nature while minimizing the segmentation error by using
   a boosted ensemble of neural networks. The proposed method compared
   favourably to state of the art techniques using two different

Volume = {{309}},
Pages = {{81-90}},

Abstract = {{Background: In diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, the
   three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (3D-MRI) has been heavily
   researched. Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common
   neurodegenerative disorders.
   New method: The performances of five different classification approaches
   using five different attribute rankings each followed with an adaptive
   Fisher stopping criteria feature selection (FS) method are evaluated. To
   improve the performance of PD detection, a source fusion technique which
   combines the gray matter (GM) and white (WM) tissue maps and a decision
   fusion technique which combines the outputs of all classifiers using the
   correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method by majority voting are
   used.
   Results: Among the five FS methods, the CFS provides the highest results
   for all five classification algorithms and the SVM provides the best
   classification performances for all five different FS methods. The
   classification accuracy of 77.50\% and 81.25\% are obtained for the GM
   and WM tissues, respectively. However, the fusion of GM and WM datasets
   improves the classification accuracy of the proposed methodology up to
   95.00\%.
   Comparison with Existing Methods: An f-contrast is used to generate 3D
   masks for GM and WM datasets and a fusion technique, combining the GM
   and WM datasets is used. Several classification algorithms using several
   FS methods are performed and a decision fusion technique is used.
   Conclusions: Using the combination of the 3D masked GM and WM tissue
   maps and the fusion of the outputs of multiple classifiers with CFS
   method gives the classification accuracy of 95.00\%.}},

Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Purpose: To demonstrate accurate MR image reconstruction from
   undersampled k-space data using cross-domain convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs)
   Methods: Cross-domain CNNs consist of 3 components: (1) a deep CNN
   operating on the k-space (KCNN), (2) a deep CNN operating on an image
   domain (ICNN), and (3) an interleaved data consistency operations. These
   components are alternately applied, and each CNN is trained to minimize
   the loss between the reconstructed and corresponding fully sampled
   k-spaces. The final reconstructed image is obtained by
   forward-propagating the undersampled k-space data through the entire
   network.
   Results: Performances of K-net (KCNN with inverse Fourier transform),
   I-net (ICNN with interleaved data consistency), and various combinations
   of the 2 different networks were tested. The test results indicated that
   K-net and I-net have different advantages/disadvantages in terms of
   tissue-structure restoration. Consequently, the combination of K-net and
   I-net is superior to single-domain CNNs. Three MR data sets, the T-2
   fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T-2 FLAIR) set from the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and 2 data sets acquired at our local
   institute (T-2 FLAIR and T-1 weighted), were used to evaluate the
   performance of 7 conventional reconstruction algorithms and the proposed
   cross-domain CNNs, which hereafter is referred to as KIKI-net. KIKI-net
   outperforms conventional algorithms with mean improvements of 2.29 dB in
   peak SNR and 0.031 in structure similarity.
   Conclusion: KIKI-net exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art
   conventional algorithms in terms of restoring tissue structures and
   removing aliasing artifacts. The results demonstrate that KIKI-net is
   applicable up to a reduction factor of 3 to 4 based on variable-density
   Cartesian undersampling.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Biomarkers that predict clinical outcomes in depression are
   essential for increasing the precision of treatments and clinical
   outcomes. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive
   neurophysiological test that has promise as a biomarker sensitive to
   treatment effects. The aim of our study was to investigate a novel
   non-linear index of resting state EEG activity as a predictor of
   clinical outcome, and compare its predictive capacity to traditional
   frequency-based indices.
   Methods: EEG was recorded from 62 patients with treatment resistant
   depression (TRD) and 25 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. TRD patients
   were treated with excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic
   stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4
   to 6 weeks. EEG signals were first decomposed using the empirical mode
   decomposition (EMD) method into band-limited intrinsic mode functions
   (IMFs). Subsequently, Permutation Entropy (PE) was computed from the
   obtained second IMF to yield an index named PEIMF2. Receiver Operator
   Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and ANOVA test were used to evaluate
   the efficiency of this index (PEIMF2) and were compared to
   frequency-band based methods.
   Results: Responders (RP) to rTMS exhibited an increase in the PEIMF2
   index compared to non-responders (NR) at F3, FCz and FC3 sites (p <
   0.01). The area under the curve (AUC) for ROC analysis was 0.8 for
   PEIMF2 index for the FC3 electrode. The PEIMF2 index was superior to
   ordinary frequency band measures.
   Conclusion: Our data show that the PEIMF2 index, yields superior outcome
   prediction performance compared to traditional frequency band indices.
   Our findings warrant further investigation of EEG-based biomarkers in
   depression; specifically entropy indices applied in band-limited EEG
   components.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},

Abstract = {{Studies have demonstrated that there are widespread significant
   differences in spontaneous brain activity between eyes-open (EO) and
   eyes-closed (EC) resting states. However, it remains largely unclear
   whether spontaneous brain activity is effectively related to EO and EC
   resting states. The amplitude, local functional concordance,
   inter-hemisphere functional synchronization, and network centrality of
   spontaneous brain activity were measured by the fraction amplitude of
   low frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo),
   voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and degree centrality (DC),
   respectively. Using the public Eyes-open/Eyes-closed dataset, we
   employed the support vector machine (SVM) and bootstrap technique to
   establish linking models for the fALFF, ReHo, VMHC and DC dimensions.
   The classification accuracies of linking models are 0.72 (0.59, 0.82),
   0.88 (0.79, 0.97), 0.82 (0.74, 0.91) and 0.70 (0.62, 0.79),
   respectively. Specifically, we observed that brain activity in the EO
   condition is significantly greater in attentional system areas,
   including the fusiform gyrus, occipital and parietal cortex, but
   significantly lower in sensorimotor system areas, including the
   precentral/postcentral gyrus, paracentral lobule (PCL) and temporal
   cortex compared to the EC condition from the four dimensions. The
   results consistently indicated that spontaneous brain activity is
   effectively related to EO and EC resting states, and the two resting
   states are of opposite brain activity in sensorimotor and occipital
   regions. It may provide new insight into the neural substrate of the
   resting state and help computational neuroscientists or
   neuropsychologists to choose an appropriate resting state condition to
   investigate various mental disorders from the resting state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique.}},

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range
   of clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the
   central nervous system leading to loss of brain function and eventual
   death. The most prevalent of these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which
   affects approximately 50 million people worldwide and is predicted to
   reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative diseases can only be fully
   diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological assessment of the type and
   distribution of protein deposits which characterise each different
   condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in aiding
   patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these
   conditions for many years. In this review, we consider the range of
   MR-based measurements and describe the findings in AD, but also contrast
   these with the second most common dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies
   (DLB).
   The most definitive observation is the major structural brain changes
   seen in AD using conventional T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, where medial
   temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most symptomatic
   patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings are
   sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic
   criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in
   tissue microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased
   fractional anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter
   structures. There are suggestions that there are subtle differences
   between AD and DLB populations. At the metabolic level,
   atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of healthy neurons in
   brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to show higher
   deposits of pathogenic proteins.
   As studies have moved from patients with advanced disease and clear
   dysfunction to patients with earlier presentation such as with mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some represents the first signs of
   their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to detect differences has
   been weaker and further work is still required, ideally in much larger
   cohorts than previously studied.
   The vast majority of imaging research in dementia populations has been
   univariate with respect to the MR-derived parameters considered. To
   date, none of these measurements has uniquely replicated the patterns of
   tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, and the ability of MR
   techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. Future
   opportunities may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches
   (position emission tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of
   structural and metabolic changes. Such developments will require
   multi-variate analyses, possibly combined with artificial intelligence
   or deep learning algorithms, to enhance our ability to combine the array
   of image derived information, genetic, gender and lifestyle factors. (C)

Abstract = {{In this paper, we introduce an automatic and robust method to detect and
   identify Alzheimer's disease (AD) using the magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. AD research as
   utilized with clinical and computer aid diagnostic tools has been
   strongly developed in recent decades. Several studies have resulted in
   many methods of early detection of AD, which benefit patient outcomes
   and new findings on the development of a deeper understanding of the
   mechanisms of this disease. Therefore, using the operation of electronic
   computers to diagnose automatically the incident of AD has served a
   vital role in supporting clinicians as well as easing significant
   elaboration on manual and subjectively AD diagnosing of clinicians for
   the patient's beneficial outcomes. To this end, we propose a deep
   learning approach-based model of AD detection applying to MRI and PET
   images. Individually, we extract non-white matter of brain PET images,
   which are guided by MRI images as an anatomical mask. Before running the
   classification module, we build an unsupervised network entitled the
   high-level layer concatenation autoencoder to pre-train the network with
   inputs as three-dimensional patches extracted from pre-processed scans.
   The learned parameters are reused for a well-known convolutional neural
   network to boost up the training procedure. We conduct experiments on a
   public data set ADNI and classified a subject into one of three groups:
   normal control, mild cognitive impairment, and AD. Our proposed method
   outperforms for AD detection problem than other methods.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, a novel electroencephalographic (EEG)-based method is
   introduced for the quantification of brain-electrical connectivity
   changes over a longitudinal evaluation of mild cognitive impaired (MCI)
   subjects. In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed
   by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals,
   Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes
   according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings.
   Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is
   calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling
   strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard
   distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series
   introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within
   a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at
   time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were
   diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying
   the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly
   increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength,
   specifically in delta and theta bands and in the overall range (0.5-32
   Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients
   exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, theta,
   alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the
   method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed
   method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach,
   appears to provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density
   modifications associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing
   noninvasive EEG signals.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays important
   role for patient care and development of future treatment. Structural
   and functional neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) and
   positron emission tomography (PET), are providing powerful imaging
   modalities to help understand the anatomical and functional neural
   changes related to AD. In recent years, machine learning methods have
   been widely studied on analysis of multi-modality neuroimages for
   quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most
   existing methods extract the hand-craft imaging features after image
   preprocessing such as registration and segmentation, and then train a
   classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. This paper
   proposes to construct cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to
   learn the multi-level and multimodal features of MRI and PET brain
   images for AD classification. First, multiple deep 3D-CNNs are
   constructed on different local image patches to transform the local
   brain image into more compact high-level features. Then, an upper
   high-level 2D-CNN followed by softmax layer is cascaded to ensemble the
   high-level features learned from the multi-modality and generate the
   latent multimodal correlation features of the corresponding image
   patches for classification task. Finally, these learned features are
   combined by a fully connected layer followed by softmax layer for AD
   classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic
   multi-level and multimodal features from multiple imaging modalities for
   classification, which are robust to the scale and rotation variations to
   some extent. No image segmentation and rigid registration are required
   in pre-processing the brain images. Our method is evaluated on the
   baseline MRI and PET images of 397 subjects including 93 AD patients,
   204 mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 76 pMCI +128 sMCI) and 100 normal
   controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an
   accuracy of 93.26\% for classification of AD vs. NC and 82.95\% for
   classification pMCI vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification
   performance.}},

Abstract = {{As Alzheimer's disease (AD) is featured with degeneration and
   irreversibility, the diagnosis of AD at early stage is important. In
   recent years, some researchers have tried to apply neural network (NN)
   to classify AD patients from healthy controls (HC) based on functional
   MRI (fMRI) data. But most study focus on a single NN and the
   classification accuracy was not high. Therefore, this paper used the
   random neural network cluster which was composed of multiple NNs to
   improve classification performance. Sixty one subjects (25 AD and 36 HC)
   were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
   (ADNI) dataset. This method not only could be used in the
   classification, but also could be used for feature selection. Firstly,
   we chose Elman NN from five types of NNs as the optimal base classifier
   of random neural network cluster based on the results of feature
   selection, and the accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster
   could reach to 92.31\% which was the highest and stable. Then we used
   the random Elman neural network cluster to select significant features
   and these features could be used to find out the abnormal regions.
   Finally, we found out 23 abnormal regions such as the precentral gyrus,
   the frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area. These results fully show
   that the random neural network cluster is worthwhile and meaningful for
   the diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate spatial normalization (SN) of amyloid positron emission

   robust and accurate SN of amyloid PET without using matched 3D MR
   images. Using 681 pairs of simultaneously acquired C-11-PIB PET and
   T1-weighted 3D MRI scans of AD, MCI, and cognitively normal subjects, we
   trained and tested two deep neural networks {[}convolutional
   auto-encoder (CAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN)] that
   produce adaptive best PET templates. More specifically, the networks
   were trained using 685,100 pieces of augmented data generated by
   rotating 527 randomly selected datasets and validated using 154
   datasets. The input to the supervised neural networks was the 3D PET
   volume in native space and the label was the spatially normalized 3D PET
   image using the transformation parameters obtained from MRI-based SN.
   The proposed deep learning approach significantly enhanced the
   quantitative accuracy of MRI-less amyloid PET assessment by reducing the
   SN error observed when an average amyloid PET template is used. Given an
   input image, the trained deep neural networks rapidly provide
   individually adaptive 3D PET templates without any discontinuity between
   the slices (in 0.02 s). As the proposed method does not require 3D MRI
   for the SN of PET images, it has great potential for use in routine
   analysis of amyloid PET images in clinical practice and research.}},

Abstract = {{Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize
   hand-crafted (e.g., voxel-based or region-based) biomarkers from
   structural magnetic resonance (MR) images as feature representations.
   However, these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or

   possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and
   the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal
   performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a
   landmark-based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically
   extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's disease. We first identify discriminative anatomical
   landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a

   have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public

Abstract = {{The concept of cognitive reserve (CR) can explain individual differences
   in susceptibility to cognitive or functional impairment in the presence
   of age or disease-related brain changes. Epidemiologic evidence
   indicates that CR helps maintain performance in the face of pathology
   across multiple cognitive domains. We therefore tried to identify a
   single, ``task-invariant{''} CR network that is active during the
   performance of many disparate tasks. In imaging data acquired from 255
   individuals age 20-80 while performing 12 different cognitive tasks, we
   used an iterative approach to derive a multivariate network that was
   expressed during the performance of all tasks, and whose degree of
   expression correlated with IQ, a proxy for CR. When applied to held out
   data or forward applied to fMRI data from an entirely different
   activation task, network expression correlated with IQ. Expression of
   the CR pattern accounted for additional variance in fluid reasoning
   performance over and above the influence of cortical thickness, and also
   moderated between cortical thickness and reasoning performance,
   consistent with the behavior of a CR network. The identification of a

   Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom
   trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental

   nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical

Abstract = {{Neural network dysfunction may contribute to functional decline and
   disease progression in neurodegenerative disorders. Diverse lines of
   evidence suggest that neuronal accumulation of tau promotes network
   dysfunction and cognitive decline. The A152T-variant of human tau
   (hTau-A152T) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several
   other tauopathies. When overexpressed in neurons of transgenic mice, it
   causes age-dependent neuronal loss and cognitive decline, as well as
   non-convulsive epileptic activity, which is also seen in patients with
   AD. Using intracranial EEG recordings with electrodes implanted over the
   parietal cortex, we demonstrate that hTau-A152T increases the power of
   brain oscillations in the 0.5-6 Hz range more than wildtype human tau in
   transgenic lines with comparable levels of human tau protein in brain,
   and that genetic ablation of endogenous tau in Mapt(-/-) mice decreases
   the power of these oscillations as compared to wildtype controls.
   Suppression of hTau-A152T production in doxycycline-regulatable
   transgenic mice reversed their abnormal network activity. Treatment of
   hTau-A152T mice with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam also rapidly
   and persistently reversed their brain dysrhythmia and network
   hypersynchrony. These findings suggest that both the level and the
   sequence of tau modulate the power of specific brain oscillations. The
   potential of EEG spectral changes as a biomarker deserves to be explored
   in clinical trials of tau-lowering therapeutics. Our results also
   suggest that levetiracetam treatment is able to counteract tau-dependent
   neural network dysfunction. Tau reduction and levetiracetam treatment
   may be of benefit in AD and other conditions associated with brain
   dysrhythmias and network hypersynchrony.}},

Abstract = {{Brain functional imaging data, especially functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) data, have been employed to reflect functional
   integration of the brain. Alteration in brain functional connectivity
   (FC) is expected to provide potential biomarkers for classifying or

   review in order to provide guidance about the available brain FC
   measures and typical classification strategies. We survey the
   state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static
   functional connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic
   functional connectivity (DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of
   interest (ROIs), data-driven spatial network and functional network
   connectivity (FNC) are often computed to reflect SFC from different
   angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a sliding-window framework, and
   intrinsic connectivity states along the time-varying connectivity
   patterns are typically extracted using clustering or decomposition
   approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches.
   Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection
   including the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model
   building, we include traditional classifiers as well as more recently
   applied deep learningmethods. Moreover, we review representative
   applications with remarkable classification accuracy for psychosis and
   mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and neurological disorders
   using fMRI data. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum
   disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD),
   Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed.

Title = {{The association between ``Brain-Age Score{''} (BAS) and traditional
   neuropsychological screening tools in Alzheimer's disease}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: We present the Brain-Age Score (BAS) as a magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI)-based index for Alzheimer's disease (AD). We
   developed a fully automated framework for estimating the BAS in healthy
   controls (HCs) and individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or
   AD, using MRI scans.
   Methods: We trained the proposed framework using 385 HCs from the IXI
   and OASIS datasets and evaluated 146 HCs, 102 stable-MCI (sMCI), 112
   progressive-MCI (pMCI), and 147 AD patients from the J-ADNI dataset. We
   used a correlation test to determine the association between the BAS and
   four traditional screening tools of AD: the Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE), Clinical Dementia Ratio (CDR), Alzheimer's Disease
   Assessment Score (ADAS), and Functional Assessment Questionnaire (FAQ).
   Furthermore, we assessed the association between BAS and anatomical MRI
   measurements: the normalized gray matter (nGM), normalized white matter
   (nWM), normalized cerebrospinal fluid (nCSF), mean cortical thickness as
   well as hippocampus volume.
   Results: The correlation results demonstrated that the BAS is in line
   with traditional screening tools of AD (i.e., the MMSE, CDR, ADAS, and
   FAQ scores) as well as anatomical MRI measurements (i.e., nGM, nCSF,
   mean cortical thickness, and hippocampus volume).
   Discussion: The BAS may be useful for diagnosing the brain atrophy level
   and can be a reliable automated index for clinical applications and
   neuropsychological screening tools.}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded as an intermediate
   stage between typical aging and dementia, with nearly 50\% of patients
   with amnestic MCI (aMCI) converting to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within
   30 months of follow-up (Fischer et al., 2007). The growing literature
   using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging reveals both
   increased and decreased connectivity in individuals with MCI and
   connectivity loss between the anterior and posterior components of the
   default mode network (DMN) throughout the course of the disease
   progression (Hillary et al., 2015; Sheline \& Raichle, 2013; Tijms et
   al., 2013). In this paper, we use dynamic connectivity modeling and
   graph theory to identify unique brain ``states,{''} or temporal patterns
   of connectivity across distributed networks, to distinguish individuals
   with aMCI from healthy older adults (HOAs). We enrolled 44 individuals
   diagnosed with aMCI and 33 HOAs of comparable age and education. Our
   results indicated that individuals with aMCI spent significantly more
   time in one state in particular, whereas neural network analysis in the
   HOA sample revealed approximately equivalent representation across four
   distinct states. Among individuals with aMCI, spending a higher
   proportion of time in the dominant state relative to a state where
   participants exhibited high cost (a measure combining connectivity and
   distance), predicted better language performance and less perseveration.
   This is the first report to examine neural network dynamics in
   individuals with aMCI.}},

   functional connectivity in primary insomnia patients}},
Journal = {{MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{97}},

Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{The aim of the study was to study the changes in brain structure and
   functional connectivity in primary insomnia (PI) patients, as well as to
   explore the biological characteristics of PI abnormality and the
   pathophysiological mechanism underlying the brain structure and the
   abnormal functional connectivity under depression.
   Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) technique and resting-state functional
   connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fcMRI) techniques were used
   to investigate the brain structure and rs-fc in PI and light-moderate
   primary insomnia with depression (PID) patients; healthy individuals
   were used as the normal control (NC) group. The differences between the
   3 groups, the correlation between the brain network connection of the
   anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and clinical information were compared.
   Compared with the NC group, patients in PI and PID groups showed changes
   in brain structure and brain functional connectivity, which might be
   related to the pathophysiological mechanism of primary insomnia. PI
   patients had enhanced connections in the left anterior cingulate
   cortex/insula, left posterior cingulate, and the right limbic
   lobe/cingulate gyrus/paracingulate gyrus with ACC. Compared with PI
   patients, PID patients had weaker brain functional connectivity in the
   left corpus callosum/posterior cingulate with ACC and enhanced
   functional connectivity in the frontal and limbic lobes with ACC,
   suggesting that PI patients with depression had abnormal brain network
   connection.
   Primary insomnia has abnormalities in intracephalic multisystem
   structure and neural network connection. The interaction and influence
   between depression and insomnia aggravate the cognitive function damage.
   This study provided the theoretical basis for exploring the
   neuropathology underlying the PID disorder and cognitive function.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{176}},
Pages = {{71-82}},
Month = {{AUG 1}},
Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have suggested that
   advanced age may mediate the effects of transcranial direct current
   stimulation (tDCS) on brain function. However, studies directly
   comparing neural tDCS effects between young and older adults are scarce
   and limited to task-related imaging paradigms. Resting-state (rs-) fMRI,
   that is independent of age-related differences in performance, is well
   suited to investigate age-associated differential neural tDCS effects.
   Three ``online{''} tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, sham) were
   compared in a cross-over, within-subject design, in 30 young and 30
   older adults. Active stimulation targeted the left sensorimotor network
   (active electrode over left sensorimotor cortex with right supraorbital
   reference electrode). A graph-based rs-fMRI data analysis approach
   (eigenvector centrality mapping) and complementary seed-based analyses
   characterized neural tDCS effects. An interaction between anodal tDCS
   and age group was observed. Specifically, centrality in bilateral
   paracentral and posterior regions (precuneus, superior parietal cortex)
   was increased in young, but decreased in older adults. Seed-based
   analyses revealed that these opposing patterns of tDCS-induced
   centrality modulation originated from differential effects of tDCS on
   functional coupling of the stimulated left paracentral lobule. Cathodal
   tDCS did not show significant effects. Our study provides first evidence
   for differential tDCS effects on neural network organization in young
   and older adults. Anodal stimulation mainly affected coupling of
   sensorimotor with ventromedial prefrontal areas in young and decoupling
   with posteromedial areas in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveMild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition intermediate
   between physiological brain aging and dementia. Amnesic-MCI (aMCI)
   subjects progress to dementia (typically to Alzheimer-Dementia=AD) at an
   annual rate which is 20 times higher than that of cognitively intact
   elderly. The present study aims to investigate whether EEG network Small
   World properties (SW) combined with Apo-E genotyping, could reliably
   discriminate aMCI subjects who will convert to AD after approximately a
   year.
   Methods145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according
   to the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD (C-MCI,
   71) or Stable (S-MCI, 74).
   ResultsResults showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1,
   alpha2, beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD.
   Receiver Operating Characteristic(ROC) curve, based on a first-order
   polynomial regression of SW, showed 57\% sensitivity, 66\% specificity
   and 61\% accuracy(area under the curve: AUC=0.64). In 97 out of 145 MCI,
   Apo-E allele testing was also available. Combining this genetic risk
   factor with Small Word EEG, results showed: 96.7\% sensitivity, 86\%
   specificity and 91.7\% accuracy(AUC=0.97). Moreover, using only the
   Small World values in these 97 subjects, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.63;
   the resulting classifier presented 50\% sensitivity, 69\% specificity
   and 59.6\% accuracy. When different types of EEG analysis (power density
   spectrum) were tested, the accuracy levels were lower (68.86\%).
   InterpretationConcluding, this innovative EEG analysis, in combination
   with a genetic test (both low-cost and widely available), could evaluate
   on an individual basis with great precision the risk of MCI progression.
   This evaluation could then be used to screen large populations and
   quickly identify aMCI in a prodromal stage of dementia. Ann Neurol 2018

Abstract = {{A long-standing question is how to best use brain morphometric and
   genetic data to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from
   cognitively normal (CN) subjects and to predict those who will progress
   from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. Here, we use a neural
   network (NN) framework on both magnetic resonance imaging-derived
   quantitative structural brain measures and genetic data to address this
   question. We tested the effectiveness of NN models in classifying and
   predicting AD. We further performed a novel analysis of the NN model to
   gain insight into the most predictive imaging and genetics features and
   to identify possible interactions between features that affect AD risk.
   Data were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort and
   included baseline structural MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphism
   (SNP) data for 138 AD patients, 225 CN subjects, and 358 MCI patients.
   We found that NN models with both brain and SNP features as predictors
   perform significantly better than models with either alone in
   classifying AD and CN subjects, with an area under the receiver
   operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992, and in predicting the
   progression from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.835). The most important predictors
   in the NN model were the left middle temporal gyrus volume, the left
   hippocampus volume, the right entorhinal cortex volume, and the APOE (a
   gene that encodes apolipoprotein E) epsilon 4 risk allele. Furthermore,
   we identified interactions between the right parahippocampal gyrus and
   the right lateral occipital gyrus, the right banks of the superior
   temporal sulcus and the left posterior cingulate, and SNP rs10838725 and
   the left lateral occipital gyrus. Our work shows the ability of NN
   models to not only classify and predict AD occurrence but also to
   identify important AD risk factors and interactions among them. (C) 2018

Abstract = {{Task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging (tfMRI) has been widely
   used to study functional brain networks under task performance. Modeling
   tfMRI data is challenging due to at least two problems: the lack of the
   ground truth of underlying neural activity and the highly complex
   intrinsic structure of tfMRI data. To better understand brain networks
   based on fMRI data, data-driven approaches have been proposed, for
   instance, independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary
   learning (SDL). However, both ICA and SDL only build shallow models, and
   they are under the strong assumption that original fMRI signal could be
   linearly decomposed into time series components with their corresponding
   spatial maps. As growing evidence shows that human brain function is
   hierarchically organized, new approaches that can infer and model the
   hierarchical structure of brain networks are widely called for.
   Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has drawn much
   attention, in that deep CNN has proven to be a powerful method for
   learning high-level andmid-level abstractions from low-level raw data.
   Inspired by the power of deep CNN, in this paper, we developed a new
   neural network structure based on CNN, called deep convolutional
   auto-encoder (DCAE), in order to take the advantages of both data-driven
   approach and CNN's hierarchical feature abstraction ability for the
   purpose of learning mid-level and high-level features from complex,
   large-scale tfMRI time series in an unsupervised manner. The DCAE has
   been applied and tested on the publicly available human connectome
   project tfMRI data sets, and promising results are achieved.}},

Abstract = {{Structural MR images concomitantly acquired with PET images can provide
   crucial anatomic information for precise quantitative analysis. However,
   in the clinical setting, not all the subjects have corresponding MR
   images. Here, we developed a model to generate structural MR images from
   amyloid PET using deep generative networks. We applied our model to
   quantification of cortical amyloid load without structural MR. Methods:
   We used florbetapir PET and structural MR data from the Alzheimer
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The generative network was
   trained to generate realistic structural MR images from florbetapir PET
   images. After the training, the model was applied to the quantification
   of cortical amyloid load. PET images were spatially normalized to the
   template space using the generated MR, and then SUV ratio (SUVR) of the
   target regions was measured by predefined regions of interest. A real
   MR-based quantification was used as the gold standard to measure the
   accuracy of our approach. Other MR-less methods-a normal PET
   template-based, a multiatlas PET template-based, and a PET
   segmentation-based normalization/quantification-were also tested. We
   compared the performance of quantification methods using generated MR
   with that of MR-based and MR-less quantification methods. Results:
   Generated MR images from florbetapir PET showed signal patterns that
   were visually similar to the real MR. The structural similarity index
   between real and generated MR was 0.91 +/- 0.04. The mean absolute error
   of SUVR of cortical composite regions estimated by the generated
   MR-based method was 0.04 +/- 0.03, which was significantly smaller than
   other MR-less methods (0.29 +/- 0.12 for the normal PET template, 0.12
   +/- 0.07 for the multiatlas PET template, and 0.08 +/- 0.06 for the PET
   segmentation-based methods). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the
   generated MR-based SUVR quantification was the closest to the SUVRs
   estimated by the real MR-based method. Conclusion: Structural MR images
   were successfully generated from amyloid PET images using deep
   generative networks. Generated MR images could be used as templates for
   accurate and precise amyloid quantification. This generative method
   might be used to generate multimodal images of various organs for
   further quantitative analyses.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveIncreasing evidence suggests that cerebellar damage impacts on
   cognitive functions. Frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are
   neurodegenerative brain conditions, primarily affecting the frontal
   and/or temporal lobe. Three main phenotypes are recognized, each with a
   distinct clinical and cognitive profile: behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD),
   semantic dementia (SD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). The
   severity of cerebellar changes and their relation to cognition in FTD,
   however, remain unclear. This study aimed to establish cerebellar gray
   matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their relation to
   profiles of cognitive deficits in FTD subtypes.
   MethodsNinety-six FTD patients (45 bvFTD, 28 SD, and 23 PNFA), meeting
   current clinical diagnostic criteria, and 35 age-, sex-, and
   education-matched controls underwent brain MRI and cognitive assessment.
   Cerebral and cerebellar gray matter integrity were investigated using
   voxel-based morphometry.
   ResultsCompared with controls, widespread bilateral cerebellar changes
   were observed in all FTD subtypes, with the greatest atrophy present in
   bvFTD. Significant associations were found between cerebellar integrity
   and cognitive performance in attention and working memory in bvFTD,
   visuospatial function in SD, and language-motor function in PNFA.
   Bilateral atrophy of crus and lobule VI were most commonly associated
   with cognitive deficits, irrespective of FTD phenotype.
   InterpretationThis study is the first to identify distinct patterns of
   cerebellar atrophy across FTD syndromes, which in turn relate to
   discrete cognitive dysfunctions, after accounting for the effect of
   cerebral atrophy. These findings extend our understanding of the
   cerebellum and point to its involvement across an array of processes
   beyond the domain of motor function. Ann Neurol 2018;83:98-109}},

Abstract = {{Medical Images data is widely acknowledged for its large volumes, high
   complexities and limited labels information, which makes learning-based
   tasks challenging to obtain promising performance based on such images
   data. Also, Alzheimer's disease, one of the five most severe
   non-communicable diseases all around the world, receives much attention
   in both academic research and clinical diagnosis for the time being. It
   is generally acknowledged that magnetic resonance imaging, a popular
   imaging tool because of its free of radiation exposure in terms of
   patients safety issues, has been vastly employed in Alzheimer's disease
   diagnosis in recent years. However, most contemporary clinical diagnosis
   efforts still heavily rely on clinicians' expertise to realize the
   disease diagnosis task. In this study, inspired by the recent rapid
   development of deep learning and low-resource learning techniques, a
   novel image-based disease diagnosis scheme is proposed to automatically
   fulfil the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on arterial spin
   labeling magnetic resonance images. This new end-to-end low-resource
   learning scheme is conducted following four steps. First, raw arterial
   spin labeling images need to be acquired and essential pre-processing
   steps should be carried out on raw images. Second, the popular
   convolutional neural network technique is adopted to automatically
   extract latent trainable features from processed arterial spin labelling
   images, instead of traditional hand-crafted features. Third, a novel
   low-resource pair-wise learning method inspired by the semi-supervised
   learning theory is carried out based on latent trainable features for
   automatically determining disease similarity functions. Forth, learned
   outcomes are then fed into a multi-nominal logistic regression model and
   a regression process with the highest posterior probability is capable
   to reveal the corresponding disease diagnosis outcome. Extensive
   experiments based on a database composed of magnetic resonance images
   acquired from 350 real demented patients are carried out with the newly
   poroposed scheme being compared towards several other well-known
   diagnosis tools. All diagnosis results have undergone rigorous and
   comprehensive statistical analysis composed of analysis of variance and
   multiple comparison tests. The superiority of the new scheme has been
   demonstrated therein.}},

   greater beta power at rest than patients with aMCI patients; (b) during

   presented greater beta power than aMCI patients; (c) both groups showed

   but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and (d) aMCI patients
   presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderly during the
   task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differs
   from that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of
   task-related EEG activity extends evidences obtained during resting and
   suggests that during the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is
   a reduced efficiency in information exchange by large-scale neural
   networks. The study for the first time shows the potential of
   task-related beta responses as early markers of aMCI impairments.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain degenerative disorder
   affecting people aged older than 65 years. Currently, there is no
   effective cure for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some
   treatments. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient
   care and development of future treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons
   emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a functional molecular imaging
   modality, which proves to be powerful to help understand the anatomical
   and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most existing methods extract
   the handcrafted features from images, and then design a classifier to
   distinguish AD from other groups. These methods highly depends on the
   preprocessing of brain images, including image rigid registration and
   segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image
   classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based
   on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent
   neural networks (RNNs), which learns the intra-slice and inter-slice
   features for classification after decomposition of the 3D PET image into
   a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are built to capture the features
   of image slices while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is cascaded
   to learn and integrate the inter-slice features for image
   classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for
   PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline FDG-PET images
   acquired from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive
   impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that
   the proposed method achieves an area under receiver operating
   characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.3\% for AD vs. NC classification and
   83.9\% for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the promising
   classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo characterize {[}C-11]-PBR28 brain uptake using positron
   emission tomography (PET) in people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
   (ALS) and primary lateral sclerosis (PLS). We have previously shown
   increased {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral gyrus in a small group
   of ALS patients. Herein, we confirm our initial finding, study the
   longitudinal changes, and characterize the gray versus white matter
   distribution of {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake in a larger cohort of patients
   with ALS and PLS.
   MethodsEighty-five participants including 53 with ALS, 11 with PLS, and
   21 healthy controls underwent integrated {[}C-11]-PBR28 PET-magnetic
   resonance brain imaging. Patients were clinically assessed using the
   Upper Motor Neuron Burden (UMNB) and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis
   Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake was
   quantified as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and compared
   between groups. Cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy were
   compared between groups and correlated with SUVR and the clinical data.
   {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake and ALSFRS-R were compared longitudinally over 6
   months in 10 ALS individuals.
   ResultsWhole brain voxelwise, surface-based, and region of interest
   analyses revealed increased {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral and
   paracentral gyri in ALS, and in the subcortical white matter for the
   same regions in PLS, compared to controls. The increase in
   {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake colocalized and correlated with cortical thinning,
   reduced fractional anisotropy, and increased mean diffusivity, and
   correlated with higher UMNB score. No significant changes were detected
   in {[}C-11]-PBR28 uptake over 6 months despite clinical progression.

Abstract = {{We propose an adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) scheme
   proposed for segmenting brain lesions with considerable mass-effect, to
   segment white matter hyperintensities (WMH) characteristic of brains
   with none or mild vascular pathology in routine clinical brain magnetic
   resonance images (MRI). This is a rather difficult segmentation problem
   because of the small area (i.e., volume) of the WMH and their similarity
   to non pathological brain tissue. We investigate the effectiveness of
   the 2D CNN scheme by comparing its performance against those obtained
   from another deep learning approach: Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), two
   conventional machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM)
   and Random Forest (RF), and a public toolbox: Lesion Segmentation Tool
   (LST), all reported to be useful for segmenting WMH in MRI. We also
   introduce a way to incorporate spatial information in convolution level
   of CNN for WMH segmentation named global spatial information (GSI).
   Analysis of covariance corroborated known associations between WMH
   progression, as assessed by all methods evaluated, and demographic and
   clinical data. Deep learning algorithms outperform conventional machine
   learning algorithms by excluding MRI artefacts and pathologies that
   appear similar to WMH. Our proposed approach of incorporating GSI also
   successfully helped CNN to achieve better automatic WMH segmentation
   regardless of network's settings tested. The mean Dice Similarity
   Coefficient (DSC) values for LST-LGA, SVM, RF, DBM, CNN and CNN-GSI were

Abstract = {{For effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to
   identify subjects who are most likely to exhibit rapid cognitive
   decline. We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system
   based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately
   predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   patients using fiurodeoxyglucose and fiorbetapir positron emission
   tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with
   MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using
   3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually
   defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined
   region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it
   used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has
   been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive
   outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction
   accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was
   compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach.
   Accuracy of prediction (84.2\%) for conversion to AD in MCI patients
   outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC
   analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was
   significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification
   methods (p < 0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly
   correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p <
   0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep learning as a
   practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its onset in
   subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on structural
   MRI features is one of the most important open issues in neuroimaging.
   Accordingly, a scientific challenge has been promoted, on the
   international Kaggle platform, to assess the performance of different
   classification methods for prediction of MCI and its conversion to AD.
   New method: This work presents a classification strategy based on Random
   Forest feature selection and Deep Neural Network classification using a
   mixed cohort including the four classes of classification problem, that
   is HC, AD, MCI and cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this
   approach with a novel classification strategy based on fuzzy logic
   learned on a mixed cohort including only HC and AD.
   Experiments: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including
   mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data
   included AD patients, MCI subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects
   and healthy controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy
   (38.8\%) over 19 participating teams. Comparison with existing
   method(s): The ``International challenge for automated prediction of MCI
   from MRI data{''} hosted by the Kaggle platform has been promoted to
   validate different methodologies with a common set of data and
   evaluation procedures.
   Conclusion: DNNs reach a classification accuracy significantly higher
   than other machine learning strategies; on the other hand, fuzzy logic
   is particularly accurate with cMCI, suggesting a combination of these
   approaches could lead to interesting future perspectives. (C) 2017

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 8}},
Abstract = {{Background/Objectives : Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been
   associated with risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previous
   investigations have suggested that vascular risk factors (VRFs) were
   associated with cognitive decline and AD pathogenesis, and the
   intervention of VRFs may be a possible way to prevent dementia. However,
   in MCI, little is known about the potential impacts of VRFs on neural
   networks and their neural substrates, which may be a neuroimaging
   biomarker of the disease progression.
   Methods : 128 elderly Han Chinese participants (67 MCI subjects and 61
   matched normal elderly) with or without VRFs (hypertension, diabetes
   mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and alcohol drinking) underwent
   the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
   neuropsychological tests. We obtained the default mode network (DMN) to
   identify alterations in MCI with the varying number of the VRF and
   analyzed the significant correlation with behavioral performance.
   Results: The effects of VRF on the DMN were primarily in bilateral
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (i.e., middle frontal gyrus).
   Normal elderly showed the gradually increased functional activity of
   DLPFC, while a fluctuant activation of DLPFC was displayed in MCI with
   the growing number of the VRF. Interestingly, the left DLPFC further
   displayed significantly dynamic correlation with executive function as
   the variation of VRF loading. Initial level of compensation was observed
   in normal aging and none-vascular risk factor (NVRF) MCI, while these
   compensatory neural processes were suppressed in One-VRF MCI and were
   subsequently re-aroused in Over-One-VRF MCI.
   Conclusions: These findings suggested that the dose-dependent effects of
   VRF on DLPFC were highlighted in MCI, and the dynamic compensatory
   neural processes that fluctuated along with variations of VRF loading
   could be key role in the progression of MCI.}},

   MethodsWe conducted 3 analyses to explore associations between
   serotoninergic neurotransmission and cerebral A burden in PD. The first
   was a cross-sectional imaging study of PD subjects (n=23) using the
   serotoninergic transporter positron emission tomography (PET) ligand
   {[}C-11]3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfaryl)-benzonitrile

   was a baseline study of Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative
   (PPMI) subjects exploring the influence of serotoninergic medications on
   cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A-42 levels (n=389), controlling for age, sex,
   Geriatric Depression Scale, disease duration, and education. Third, we
   fit an interval censored proportional hazard model with longitudinal
   PPMI data (n=367) to test whether serotoninergic medication use
   associates with reduced risk of PD cognitive decline, defined as time to
   reach a Montreal Cognitive Assessment score20, adjusting for baseline
   caudate dopamine transporter {[}I-123]ioflupane single photon emission

   ResultsSerotoninergic DASB distribution volume ratio (DVR) inversely
   associated with PiB DVR in the cerebral cortex (Pearson r=-0.478,

Abstract = {{Converging evidence from structural, metabolic and functional
   connectivity MRI suggests that neurodegenerative diseases, such as
   Alzheimer's disease, target specific neural networks. However,
   age-related network changes commonly co-occur with neuropathological
   cascades, limiting efforts to disentangle disease-specific alterations
   in network function from those associated with normal ageing. Here we
   elucidate the differential effects of ageing and Alzheimer's disease
   pathology through simultaneous analyses of two functional connectivity
   MRI datasets: (i) young participants harbouring highly-penetrant
   mutations leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease from the
   Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an Alzheimer's disease
   cohort in which agerelated comorbidities are minimal and likelihood of
   progression along an Alzheimer's disease trajectory is extremely high;
   and (ii) young and elderly participants from the Harvard Aging Brain
   Study, a cohort in which imaging biomarkers of amyloid burden and
   neurodegeneration can be used to disambiguate ageing alone from
   preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Consonant with prior reports, we
   observed the preferential degradation of cognitive (especially the
   default and dorsal attention networks) over motor and sensory networks
   in early autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, and found that this
   distinctive degradation pattern was magnified in more advanced stages of
   disease. Importantly, a nascent form of the pattern observed across the
   autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease spectrum was also detectable in
   clinically normal elderly with clear biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's
   disease pathology (preclinical Alzheimer's disease). At the more
   granular level of individual connections between node pairs, we observed
   that connections within cognitive networks were preferentially targeted
   in Alzheimer's disease (with between network connections relatively
   spared), and that connections between positively coupled nodes
   (correlations) were preferentially degraded as compared to connections
   between negatively coupled nodes (anti-correlations). In contrast,
   ageing in the absence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers was
   characterized by a far less network-specific degradation across
   cognitive and sensory networks, of between-and within-network
   connections, and of connections between positively and negatively
   coupled nodes. We go on to demonstrate that formalizing the differential
   patterns of network degradation in ageing and Alzheimer's disease may
   have the practical benefit of yielding connectivity measurements that
   highlight early Alzheimer's disease-related connectivity changes over
   those due to agerelated processes. Together, the contrasting patterns of
   connectivity in Alzheimer's disease and ageing add to prior work arguing
   against Alzheimer's disease as a form of accelerated ageing, and suggest
   multi-network composite functional connectivity MRI metrics may be
   useful in the detection of early Alzheimer's disease-specific
   alterations co-occurring with age-related connectivity changes. More
   broadly, our findings are consistent with a specific pattern of network
   degradation associated with the spreading of Alzheimer's disease
   pathology within targeted neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from magnetic resonance images can
   help neuroradiologists to make decision rapidly and avoid missing slight
   lesions in the brain. Currently, scholars have proposed several
   approaches to automatically detect AD. In this study, we aimed to
   develop a novel AD detection system with better performance than
   existing systems. 28 ADs and 98 HCs were selected from OASIS dataset. We
   used inter-class variance criterion to select single slice from the 3D
   volumetric data. Our classification system is based on three successful
   components: wavelet entropy, multilayer perceptron, and
   biogeography-base optimization. The statistical results of our method
   obtained an accuracy of 92.40 +/- 0.83\%, a sensitivity of 92.14 +/-
   4.39\%, a specificity of 92.47 +/- 1.23\%. After comparison, we observed
   that our pathological brain detection system is superior to latest 6
   other approaches.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To provide an up-to-date systematic review of the
   characteristics, methodology and findings of studies that have
   investigated the neurochemistry of agitation in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD).
   Methods: Electronic databases were searched for published peer-reviewed
   articles which provided data on any neurotransmitter system in relation
   to agitation in AD. Screening of titles and abstracts and data
   extraction from full texts were conducted in duplicate.
   Results: Forty-five studies were included. Monoamines (serotonin,
   dopamine and noradrenaline) were most commonly investigated. A variety
   of methods were used to investigate the neurochemistry underlying
   agitation in AD and, although there were several conflicting findings,
   there was evidence of serotonergic deficit, relatively preserved
   dopaminergic function and compensatory overactivity of postsynaptic
   noradrenergic neurons in agitation in AD.
   Conclusions: Disruption of the dynamic balance between multiple
   neurotransmitter systems could impair functional neural networks
   involved in affective regulation and executive function. Differences in
   study design and methodology may have contributed to conflicting
   findings. Future studies that overcome these limitations (e.g. using
   standardized criteria to define agitation) and employ neuroimaging
   methods such as MRI/PET to investigate specific neural networks are
   needed to clarify the role of neurotransmitter alterations in these

Abstract = {{Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's,
   constitute a major factor in long-term disability and are becoming more
   and more a serious concern in developed countries. As there are, at

   patients. In this sense, the adoption of computer-aided-diagnosis tools
   can offer significant assistance to clinicians. In the present paper, we
   provide in the first place a comprehensive recording of medical
   examinations relevant to those disorders. Then, a review is conducted
   concerning the use of Machine Learning techniques in supporting
   diagnosis of neurodegenerative diseases, with reference to at times used
   medical datasets. Special attention has been given to the field of Deep
   Learning. In addition to that, we communicate the launch of a newly
   created dataset for Parkinson's disease, containing epidemiological,
   clinical and imaging data, which will be publicly available to

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative
   diseases with a commonly seen prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   phase where memory loss is the main complaint progressively worsening
   with behavior issues and poor self-care. However, not all individuals
   clinically diagnosed with MCI progress to AD. A fraction of subjects
   with MCI either progress to non-AD dementia or remain stable at the MCI
   stage without progressing to dementia. Although a curative treatment of
   AD is currently unavailable, it is extremely important to correctly
   identify the individuals in the MCI phase that will go on to develop AD
   so that they may benefit from a curative treatment when one becomes
   available in the near future. At the same time, it would be highly
   desirable to also correctly identify those in the MCI phase that do not
   have AD pathology so they may be spared from unnecessary pharmocologic
   interventions that, at best, may provide them no benefit, and at worse,
   could further harm them with adverse side-effects. Additionally, it may
   be easier and simpler to identify the cause of the cognitive impairment
   in these non-AD cases, and hence proper identification of prodromal AD
   will be of benefit to these individuals as well.
   Fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) captures the
   metabolic activity of the brain, and this imaging modality has been
   reported to identify changes related to AD prior to the onset of
   structural changes. Prior work on designing classifier using FDG-PET
   imaging has been promising. Since deep-learning has recently emerged as
   a powerful tool to mine features and use them for accurate labeling of
   the group membership of given images, we propose a novel deep-learning
   framework using FDG-PET metabolism imaging to identify subjects at the
   MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and discriminate them from other
   subjects with MCI (non-AD / non-progressive). Our multiscale deep neural
   network obtained 82.51\% accuracy of classification just using measures
   from a single modality (FDG-PET metabolism data) outperforming other
   comparable FDG-PET classifiers published in the recent literature. (C)

Abstract = {{The behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) usually emerges
   with behavioral changes similar to changes in late-life bipolar disorder
   (BD) especially in the early stages. According to the literature, a
   substantial number of bvFTD cases have been misdiagnosed as BD. Since
   the literature lacks studies comparing differential diagnosis ability of
   electrophysiological and neuroimaging findings in BD and bvFTD, we aimed
   to show their classification power using an artificial neural network
   and genetic algorithm based approach. Eighteen patients with the
   diagnosis of bvFTD and 20 patients with the diagnosis of late-life BD
   are included in the study. All patients' clinical magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scan and electroencephalography recordings were assessed
   by a double-blind method to make diagnosis from MRI data. Classification
   of bvFTD and BD from total 38 participants was performed using feature
   selection and a neural network based on general algorithm. The
   artificial neural network method classified BD from bvFTD with 76\%
   overall accuracy only by using on EEG power values. The radiological
   diagnosis classified BD from bvFTD with 79\% overall accuracy. When the
   radiological diagnosis was added to the EEG analysis, the total
   classification performance raised to 87\% overall accuracy. These
   results suggest that EEG and MRI combination has more powerful

   may support the utility of neurophysiological and structural
   neuroimaging assessments for discriminating the 2 pathologies.}},

Abstract = {{Recently, a benzofuran derivative for the imaging of beta-amyloid
   plaques, 5-(5-(2-(2-(2-F-18-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzofuran-2-yl)-
   N-methylpyridin-2-amine (F-18-FPYBF-2) has been validated as a tracer
   for amyloid imaging and it was found that F-18-FPYBF-2 PET/CT is a
   useful and reliable diagnostic tool for the evaluation of AD (Higashi et
   al. Ann Nucl Med, 10.1007/s12149-018-1236-1, 2018). The aim of this
   study was to assess the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of
   diagnostic dosages of F-18-FPYBF-2 in normal healthy volunteers as a
   first-in-man study.
   Four normal healthy volunteers (male: 3, female: 1; mean age: 40 +/- 17;
   age range 25-56) were included and underwent F-18-FPYBF-2 PET/CT study
   for the evaluation of radiation exposure and pharmacokinetics. A 10-min
   dynamic PET/CT scan of the body (chest and abdomen) was performed at
   0-10 min and a 15-min whole-body static scan was performed six times
   after the injection of F-18-FPYBF-2. After reconstructing PET and CT
   image data, individual organ time-activity curves were estimated by
   fitting volume of interest data from the dynamic scan and whole-body
   scans. The OLINDA/EXM version 2.0 software was used to determine the
   whole-body effective doses.
   Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated that the hepatobiliary and renal
   systems were the principal pathways of clearance of F-18-FPYBF-2. High
   uptake in the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach, and the kidneys
   were demonstrated, followed by the intestines and the urinary bladder.
   The ED for the adult dosimetric model was estimated to be 8.48 +/- 1.25
   A mu Sv/MBq. The higher absorbed doses were estimated for the liver
   (28.98 +/- 12.49 and 36.21 +/- 15.64 A mu Gy/MBq), the brain (20.93 +/-
   4.56 and 23.05 +/- 5.03A mu Gy/MBq), the osteogenic cells (9.67 +/- 1.67
   and 10.29 +/- 1.70 A mu Gy/MBq), the small intestines (9.12 +/- 2.61 and
   11.12 +/- 3.15 A mu Gy/MBq), and the kidneys (7.81 +/- 2.62 and 8.71 +/-
   2.90 A mu Gy/MBq) for male and female, respectively.
   The ED for the adult dosimetric model was similar to those of other
   agents used for amyloid PET imaging. The diagnostic dosage of 185-370
   MBq of F-18-FPYBF-2 was considered to be acceptable for administration
   in patients as a diagnostic tool for the evaluation of AD.}},

   leads to neural networks overexcitation and is involved in cerebral
   autoregulation. We aimed to evaluate the association between serum
   bicarbonate concentration as a measure of metabolic acidosis, and
   cognitive function in hypertensive adults with and without CKD.
   Design, setting, participants, \& measurements Five cognitive summary
   scores were measured (global cognitive function, executive function,
   memory, attention/concentration, and language) in 2853 participants in
   the Systolic BP Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Multivariable linear
   regression models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, systolic BP,
   medications, eGFR and albuminuria evaluated the cross-sectional
   association between bicarbonate and cognition at SPRINT baseline. In a
   subset (n=681) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, the
   models were adjusted for white matter hyperintensity volume, vascular
   reactivity, and cerebral blood flow.
   Results The mean age (SD) was 68 (8.5) years. Global cognitive and
   executive functions were positively associated with serum bicarbonate
   (estimate {[}SEM]: 0.014 {[}0.006]; P=0.01, and 0.018 {[}0.006];
   P=0.003, respectively). Each 1 mEq/L lower bicarbonate level had a
   similar association with global cognitive and executive function as
   being 4.3 and 5.4 months older, respectively. The association with
   global cognition persisted after magnetic resonance imaging findings
   adjustment (estimate {[}SEM]: 0.03 {[}0.01]; P=0.01). There was no
   association between serum bicarbonate level and memory,

   MethodsWe performed PET-guided MRS in cases of probable AD, mild

   were imaged by C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (C-11-PiB) and
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET followed by 3T MRS. PET images
   were assessed both visually and using standardized uptake value ratios
   (SUVRs). MRS voxels were placed in regions with maximum abnormality on
   amyloid (A+) and FDG (hypometabolic) areas on PET scans. Corresponding
   normal areas were selected in controls. The ratios of total N-acetyl
   (tNA) group, myoinositol (mI), choline, and glutamate+glutamine over
   creatine (Cr) were compared between these regions.
   ResultsA+regions had significantly higher (p=0.02) mI/Cr and lower
   tNA/Cr (p=0.02), whereas in hypometabolic areas only tNA/Cr was reduced
   (p=0.003). Multiple regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, and

Abstract = {{Purpose: This work presents an automatic characterization of the
   Alzheimer's disease describing the illness as a multidirectional
   departure from a baseline defining the control state, being these
   directions determined by a distance between functional-equivalent
   anatomical regions.
   Methods: After a brain parcellation, a region is described by its
   histogram of gray levels, and the Earth mover's distance establishes how
   close or far these regions are. The medoid of the control group is set
   as the reference and any brain is characterized by its set of distances
   to this medoid.
   Evaluation: This hypothesis was assessed by separating groups of
   patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment
   from control subjects, using a subset of the Open Access Series of
   Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. An additional experiment evaluated the
   method generalization and consisted in training with the OASIS data and
   testing with the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's
   disease (MIRIAD) database.
   Results: Classification between controls and patients with AD resulted
   in an equal error rate of 0.1 (90\% of sensitivity and specificity at
   the same time). The automatic ranking of regions resulting is in strong
   agreement with those regions described as important in clinical
   practice. Classification with different databases results in a
   sensitivity of 85\% and a specificity of 91\%.
   Conclusions: This method automatically finds out a multidimensional
   expression of the AD, which is directly related to the anatomical
   changes in specific areas such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the
   planum temporale, and thalamus.}},

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis is critical for individuals with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) in clinical practice because its progress is irreversible. In the
   existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been
   applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on
   neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to
   classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less
   than 90\%. The method of random support vector machine cluster was
   proposed to classify AD and HC in this paper. From the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD
   individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification
   accuracy could reach to 94.44\% in the results. Furthermore, the method
   could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be
   maintained at the level of 94.44\%. In addition, we could also find out
   abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus,
   precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex). It is worth noting that the
   proposed random support vector machine cluster could be a new insight to
   help the diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectivesTo assess {[}F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET (positron emission
   tomography) uptake patterns across the primary progressive aphasia (PPA)
   variants (logopenic, semantic, and agrammatic), examine regional uptake
   patterns of {[}F-18]AV-1451 independent of clinical diagnosis, and
   compare the diagnostic utility of {[}F-18]AV-1451,
   {[}F-18]-fluorodeoxygluclose (FDG)-PET and MRI (magnetic resonance
   imaging) to differentiate the PPA variants.
   MethodsWe performed statistical parametric mapping of {[}F-18]AV-1451
   across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA=14, semantic-PPA=13, and
   agrammatic-PPA=13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, Pittsburgh
   compound B-negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal
   component analysis of regional {[}F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET standard uptake
   value ratio was performed to understand underlying patterns of
   {[}F-18]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized
   multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic
   utility.
   ResultsLogopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex,
   particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA, and
   agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns
   of focal {[}F-18]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake
   (left>right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and
   agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left>right)
   throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical gray matter
   structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal
   component analysis of regional {[}F-18]AV-1451 indicated two primary
   dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from
   agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal versus temporal contrast
   that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic
   utility of {[}F-18]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to
   FDG-PET.
   Interpretation{[}F-18]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the
   PPA variants and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants.
   {[}F-18]AV-1451binding characteristics were as good or better than other
   brain imaging modalities utilized in clinical practice, suggesting that
   {[}F-18]AV-1451 may have clinical diagnostic utility in PPA. Ann Neurol

   Neuronal Activity}},
Journal = {{INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{28}},
Number = {{2}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{It is clear that the topological structure of a neural network somehow
   determines the activity of the neurons within it. In the present work,
   we ask to what extent it is possible to examine the structural features
   of a network and learn something about its activity? Specifically, we
   consider how the centrality (the importance of a node in a network) of a
   neuron correlates with its firing rate. To investigate, we apply an
   array of centrality measures, including In-Degree, Closeness,
   Betweenness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search
   (HITS) and NeuronRank to Leaky-Integrate and Fire neural networks with
   different connectivity schemes. We find that Katz centrality is the best
   predictor of firing rate given the network structure, with almost
   perfect correlation in all cases studied, which include purely
   excitatory and excitatory-inhibitory networks, with either homogeneous
   connections or a small-world structure. We identify the properties of a
   network which will cause this correlation to hold. We argue that the
   reason Katz centrality correlates so highly with neuronal activity
   compared to other centrality measures is because it nicely captures
   disinhibition in neural networks. In addition, we argue that these
   theoretical findings are applicable to neuroscientists who apply
   centrality measures to functional brain networks, as well as offer a
   neurophysiological justification to high level cognitive models which
   use certain centrality measures.}},

Abstract = {{ObjectiveTo use a cluster analysis of {[}F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET data to
   determine how subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) vary in the
   relative involvement of the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and
   determine whether relative involvement of these two regions can help
   explain variability in age and clinical phenotype in AD.
   MethodsWe calculated {[}F-18]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and
   neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive AD patients (39 typical and 23 atypical
   presentation). tau-PET (positron emission tomography) values were
   normalized to the cerebellum to create standard uptake value ratios
   (SUVRs). tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to
   clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis.
   Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and
   apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.
   ResultsThe cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and
   cortical uptake (E-Lo/C-Lo), one with low entorhinal but high cortical
   uptake (E-Lo/C-Hi), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake
   (E-Hi/C-Hi). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical
   AD most commonly observed in the E-Lo/C-Lo and E-Hi/C-Hi clusters, and
   atypical AD most commonly observed in the E-Lo/C-Hi cluster. The
   E-Lo/C-Lo cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other
   clusters. Apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E-Lo/C-Hi
   cluster. The E-Hi/C-Hi cluster had the worst memory impairment, whereas
   the E-Lo/C-Hi cluster had the worst impairment in nonmemory domains.
   InterpretationThis study demonstrates considerable variability in
   {[}F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straightforward
   clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age
   and clinical presentation in AD. Ann Neurol 2018 Ann Neurol

Title = {{Influencing connectivity and cross-frequency coupling by real-time
   source localized neurofeedback of the posterior cingulate cortex reduces
   tinnitus related distress}},
Journal = {{NEUROBIOLOGY OF STRESS}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{8}},
Pages = {{211-224}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: In this study we are using source localized neurofeedback to
   moderate tinnitus related distress by influencing neural activity of the
   target region as well as the connectivity within the default network.
   Hypothesis: We hypothesize that up-training alpha and down-training beta
   and gamma activity in the posterior cingulate cortex has a moderating
   effect on tinnitus related distress by influencing neural activity of
   the target region as well as the connectivity within the default network
   and other functionally connected brain areas.
   Methods: Fifty-eight patients with chronic tinnitus were included in the
   study. Twenty-three tinnitus patients received neurofeedback training of
   the posterior cingulate cortex with the aim of up-training alpha and
   down-training beta and gamma activity, while 17 patients underwent
   training of the lingual gyrus as a control situation. A second control
   group consisted of 18 tinnitus patients on a waiting list for future
   tinnitus treatment.
   Results: This study revealed that neurofeedback training of the
   posterior cingulate cortex results in a significant decrease of tinnitus
   related distress. No significant effect on neural activity of the target
   region could be obtained. However, functional and effectivity
   connectivity changes were demonstrated between remote brain regions or
   functional networks as well as by altering cross frequency coupling of
   the posterior cingulate cortex.
   Conclusion: This suggests that neurofeedback could remove the
   information, processed in beta and gamma, from the carrier wave, alpha,
   which transports the high frequency information and influences the
   salience attributed to the tinnitus sound. Based on the observation that
   much pathology is the result of an abnormal functional connectivity
   within and between neural networks various pathologies should be
   considered eligible candidates for the application of source localized
   EEG based neurofeedback training. (c) 2016 The Authors. Published by

   modulate the brain reserve in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal
   dementia}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{311-318}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive reserve may delay disease onset and mitigate
   symptoms presentation in neurodegenerative dementias. Although high
   occupation levels can be associated with higher cognitive reserve in the
   behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), it was never
   addressed how specific occupation profiles involving social interaction,
   executive and attention abilities can modulate neural reserve in bvFTD.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively included thirty-seven bvFTD
   patients with clinical-neuropsychological and FDG-PET brain metabolic
   data. We considered occupation levels according to 1) a 5-point scale
   and 2) the specific cognitive dimensions from the O{*}Net network
   database. We used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the
   O{*}Net variables most representative of ``worker{''} and
   ``occupation{''} socio-cognitive skills to merge the best components
   describing such occupation profiles. We then performed regression
   analyses with brain metabolism using either 5-level occupation scale or
   the PCA specific profiles as independent variables, controlling for
   education and disease severity.
   Results: According to the brain reserve hypothesis, higher occupation
   levels were associated with a more severe hypometabolism in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, among the identified PCA
   profiles, social skills were associated with severe hypo metabolism in
   medial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and cognitive control in the
   left fronto-insular cortex.
   Discussion: This study contributes to define the role of specific
   occupation profiles as proxy of cognitive reserve in bvFTD, providing
   the first evidence for social interaction and cognitive control skills
   in life-occupation activities as influencing factors of neural reserve
   against neurodegeneration in bvFTD. Jobs placing high demand on such
   abilities seem to act as protective factors in bvFTD. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Hippocampal atrophy is a supportive feature for the
   diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even for an
   expert neuroradiologist, tracing the hippocampus and measuring its
   volume is a time consuming and extremely challenging task. Accordingly,
   the development of reliable fully-automated segmentation algorithms is
   of paramount importance.
   Materials and methods: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and
   the robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network
   (HUMAN) segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD
   diagnosis. For these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects
   and their T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The
   cohort included 145 controls (CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   subjects and 94 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the baseline, repeat, 12 and 24
   month follow-up scans were available.
   Results: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3\% precision; volume
   measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC)
   AUC(1) = 0.08 +/- 0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler
   effects present in MCI subjects, AUC(2) = 0.76 +/- 0.05. The algorithm
   is stable and reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans.
   Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise
   segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN,
   can effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become
   a useful tool for other neuroimaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Here we test the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative process in
   Parkinson's disease (PD) moves stereotypically along neural networks,
   possibly reflecting the spread of toxic alpha-synuclein molecules. PD
   patients (n = 105) and matched controls (n = 57) underwent T1-MRI at

   Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally

   baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one
   described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest

Abstract = {{Standard quantification of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) data
   requires a long acquisition time to enable pharmacokinetic (PK) model
   fitting, however blood flow information from Arterial Spin Labelling
   (ASL) Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be combined with simultaneous
   dynamic PET data to reduce the acquisition time. Due the difficulty of
   fitting a PK model to noisy PET data with limited time points, such
   `fixed-R-1' techniques are constrained to a 30min minimum acquisition,
   which is intolerable for many patients. In this work we apply a deep
   convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to combine the PET and MRI
   data. This permits shorter acquisition times as it avoids the noise
   sensitive voxelwise PK modelling and facilitates the full modelling of
   the relationship between blood flow and the dynamic PET data. This
   method is compared to three fixed-R-1 PK methods, and the clinically
   used standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR), using 60 min dynamic PET PK
   modelling as the gold standard. Testing on 11 subjects participating in
   a study of pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease showed that, for 30min
   acquisitions, all methods which combine the PET and MRI data have
   comparable performance, however at shorter acquisition times the CNN
   approach has a significantly lower mean square error (MSE) compared to
   fixed-R-1 PK modelling (p = 0.001). For both acquisition windows, SUVR
   had a significantly higher MSE than the CNN method (p <= 0.003). This
   demonstrates that combining simultaneous PET and MRI data using a CNN
   can result in robust PET quantification within a scan time which is
   tolerable to patients with dementia.}},

Abstract = {{The quantitative use of medical images often requires an intensity
   scaling with respect to the signal from a well-characterized anatomical
   region of interest. The choice of such a region often varies between
   studies which can substantially influence the quantification, resulting
   in study bias hampering objective findings which are detrimental to open
   science. This study outlines a list of criteria and a statistical
   ranking approach for identifying normalization region of interest. The
   proposed criteria include (i) associations between reference region and
   demographics such as age, (ii) diagnostic group differences in the
   reference region, (iii) correlation between reference and primary areas
   of interest, (iv) local variance in the reference region, and (v)
   longitudinal reproducibility of the target regions when normalized. The
   proposed approach has been used to establish an optimal normalization
   region of interest for the analysis of Quantitative Susceptibility
   Mapping (QSM) of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This was achieved by
   using cross-sectional data from 119 subjects with normal cognition, mild
   cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease as well as and 19 healthy
   elderly individuals with longitudinal data. For the QSM application, we
   found that normalizing by the white matter regions not only satisfies

Abstract = {{Although alternations of brain functional networks (BFNs) derived from
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been
   considered as promising biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   diagnosis, it is still challenging to perform individualized diagnosis,
   especially at the very early stage of preclinical stage of AD, i.e.,
   early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI). Recently, convolutional neural
   networks (CNNs) show powerful ability in computer vision and image
   analysis applications, but there is still a gap for directly applying
   CNNs to rs-fMRI-based disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a
   novel multiple-BFN-based 3D CNN framework that can automatically and
   deeply learn complex, high-level, hierarchical diagnostic features from
   various independent component analysis-derived BFNs. More importantly,
   the embedded features of different BFNs could comprehensively support
   each other towards a more accurate eMCI diagnosis in a unified model.
   The performance of the proposed method is validated by a large-sample,
   multisite, rigorously controlled publicly accessible dataset. The
   proposed framework can also be conveniently and straightforwardly
   applied to individualized diagnosis of various neurological and
   psychiatric diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modal neuroimages (e. g., MRI and PET) have been widely used for
   diagnosis of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) by
   providing complementary information. However, in practice, it is
   unavoidable to have missing data, i. e., missing PET data for many
   subjects in the ADNI dataset. A straightforward strategy to tackle this
   challenge is to simply discard subjects with missing PET, but this will
   significantly reduce the number of training subjects for learning
   reliable diagnostic models. On the other hand, since different
   modalities (i. e., MRI and PET) were acquired from the same subject,
   there often exist underlying relevance between different modalities.
   Accordingly, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework for AD
   diagnosis using both MRI and PET data. Specifically, in the first stage,
   we impute missing PET data based on their corresponding MRI data by
   using 3D Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-cGAN) to
   capture their underlying relationship. In the second stage, with the
   complete MRI and PET (i. e., after imputation for the case of missing
   PET), we develop a deep multi-instance neural network for AD diagnosis
   and also mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction.
   Experimental results on subjects from ADNI demonstrate that our
   synthesized PET images with 3D-cGAN are reasonable, and also our
   two-stage deep learning method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
   in AD diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{New positron emission tomography (PET) tracers could have a substantial
   impact on early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) progression, particularly if they are accompanied by
   optimised deep learning methods. To realize the full potential of deep
   learning for PET imaging, large datasets are required for training.
   However, dataset sizes are restricted due to limited availability.
   Meanwhile, most of the AD classification studies have been based on
   structural MRI rather than PET. In this paper, we propose a novel
   application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to
   the generation of F-18-florbetapir PET images from corresponding MRI
   images. Furthermore, we show that generated PET images can be used for
   synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of 3D
   Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for predicting progression to AD.
   Our method is applied to a dataset of 79 PET images, obtained from
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We generate
   high quality PET images from corresponding MRIs using cGANs, and we
   evaluate the quality of generated PET images by comparison to real
   images. We then use the trained cGANs to generate synthetic PET images
   from additional MRI dataset. Finally we build a 152-layer ResNet to
   compare the MCI classification performance using both traditional data
   augmentation method and our proposed synthetic data augmentation method.
   Mean Structural Similarity (SSIM) index was 0.95 +/- 0.05 for generated
   PET and real PET. For MCI progression classification, the traditional
   data augmentation method showed 75\% accuracy while the synthetic data
   augmentation improved this to 82\%.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly
   and the number of sufferers increases year by year. Early detection of
   AD is highly beneficial to provide timely treatment and possible
   medication, which is still an open challenge. To meet challenges of the
   early diagnosis of AD and its early stage (e.g., progressive MCI (pMCI)
   and stable MCI (sMCI)) in clinical practice, we present a novel deep
   learning framework in this paper. The proposed framework exploits the
   merits of 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and stacked
   bidirectional recurrent neural network (SBi-RNN). Specifically, we
   devise simple 3D-CNN architecture to obtain the deep feature
   representation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron
   emission tomography (PET) images, respectively. We further apply SBi-RNN
   on the local deep cascaded and flattened descriptors for performance
   boosting. Extensive experiments are performed on the ADNI dataset to
   investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Our method
   achieves an average accuracy of 94.29\% for AD vs. normal classification
   (NC), 84.66\% of pMCI vs. NC and 64.47\% sMCI vs. NC, which outperforms
   the related algorithms. Also, our method is simpler and more compact
   compared with the existing methods with complex preprocessing and
   feature engineering processes.}},

Abstract = {{Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely applied to
   analysis and diagnosis of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) and its prodrome, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
   Traditional methods usually construct connectivity networks (CNs) by
   simply calculating Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between time
   series of brain regions, and then extract low-level network measures as
   features to train the learning model. However, the valuable observation
   information in network construction (e.g., specific contributions of
   different time points) and high-level (i.e., high-order) network
   properties are neglected in these methods. In this paper, we first
   define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure
   the correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are
   determined in a data-driven manner to characterize the contribution of
   each time point, thus conveying the richer interaction information of
   brain regions compared with the PCC method. Furthermore, we propose a
   wc-kernel based convolutional neural network (CNN) (called wck-CNN)
   framework for extracting the hierarchical (i.e., from low-order to
   high-order) functional connectivities for disease diagnosis, by using
   fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to build dynamic CNs
   (DCNs) using the defined wc-kernels. Then, we define three layers to
   extract local (region specific), global (network specific) and temporal
   high-order properties from the constructed low-order functional
   connectivities as features for classification. Results on 174 subjects
   (a total of 563 scans) with rs-fMRI data from ADNI suggest that the our
   method can not only improve the performance compared with
   state-of-the-art methods, but also provide novel insights into the
   interaction patterns of brain activities and their changes in diseases.}},

Abstract = {{In this paper, we propose a novel method for MRI-based AD/MCI diagnosis
   that systematically integrates voxel-based, region-based, and
   patch-based approaches in a unified framework. Specifically, we
   parcellate a brain into predefined regions by using anatomical
   knowledge, i.e., template, and find complex nonlinear relations among
   voxels, whose intensity denotes the volumetric measure in our case,
   within each region. Unlike the existing methods that mostly use a
   cubical or rectangular shape, we regard the anatomical shape of regions
   as atypical forms of patches. Using the complex nonlinear relations
   among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract
   a regional abnormality representation. We then make a final clinical
   decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over a
   whole brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality
   representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic
   observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing them
   in a brain space individually. We validated the efficacy of our method
   in experiments with baseline MRI dataset in the ADNI cohort by achieving
   promising performances in three binary classification tasks.}},

Abstract = {{As shown in computer vision, the power of deep learning lies in
   automatically learning relevant and powerful features for any perdition
   task, which is made possible through end-to-end architectures. However,
   deep learning approaches applied for classifying medical images do not
   adhere to this architecture as they rely on several pre- and
   post-processing steps. This shortcoming can be explained by the
   relatively small number of available labeled subjects, the high
   dimensionality of neuroimaging data, and difficulties in interpreting
   the results of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple
   3D Convolutional Neural Networks and exploit its model parameters to
   tailor the end-to-end architecture for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Our model can diagnose AD with an accuracy of 94.1\% on
   the popular ADNI dataset using only MRI data, which outperforms the
   previous state-of-the-art. Based on the learned model, we identify the
   disease biomarkers, the results of which were in accordance with the
   literature. We further transfer the learned model to diagnose mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI), the prodromal stage of AD, which yield
   better results compared to other methods.}},

Abstract = {{Machine learning applied to medical imaging for lesions detection, such
   as cerebral microbleeds (CMB) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), is
   challenged by the relatively small datasets available for which only
   subjective and tedious visual reading is available, and by the low
   prevalence of lesions (a few in similar to 10\% of a typical elderly
   cohort) resulting in unbalanced classes. Moreover, the lack of actual
   ground truth might limit the performance of any machine learning method
   to that of human performance. Yet, the automatic identification of those
   lesions is relevant to quantify cerebrovascular burden associated with
   dementia, such as identifying co-morbidity for Alzheimer's disease. In
   this paper, we investigated a novel approach consisting of simulating
   synthetic CMB on SWI MRI scans from healthy individuals to create a
   large and well characterized training dataset, as a data augmentation
   strategy. Firstly, we characterized actual CMBs from MRI SWI scans and
   designed a method to create realistic synthetic CMBs whose location,
   shape, appearance, and size are similar to actual CMBs. We then tested a
   supervised neural network classifier using various combinations of
   actual CMB and synthetic CMBs for training. Augmenting data with
   synthetic CMBs resulted in a large improvement over training on only
   actual CMBs only when tested on unseen lesions, and provided better
   results than other standard data augmentation approaches. Our results
   suggest that data augmentation using synthetic lesions can address the
   lack of ground truth and low prevalence limitations for medical imaging
   analysis allowing the deployment of data hungry supervised learning
   techniques such as deep learning.}},

   pipeline involved critical steps of correctly preprocessing 4D fMRI
   images i.e. 3D images varying with time. The preprocessing steps
   involved, proved to be critical in having distinct 2D image slices of
   Normal, EMCI and AD for better accuracy in understanding the most
   discriminative features of the fMRI brain scans. Transfer Learning is
   the concept involved wherein we utilize pretrained complex deep models

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurological
   disorder that causes memory and thinking skill loss. Many different
   methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from
   neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns
   in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of
   different stages a challenge for researchers.
   In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was
   applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We
   classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning
   algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control
   (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair
   (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before
   applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed.
   Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the
   AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in
   classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63\%. We then
   tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model
   per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97\% for AD, 95.64\% for EMCI,
   95.89\% for LMCI, 98.34\% for NC, and 94.55\% for SMC.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease
   that is progressive and can be characterized mostly by neuronal atrophy,
   amyloid deposition, accompanied by cognition, behavioral and
   psychological deficits. In the recent decade, a variety of machine
   learning algorithms have been explored and used for AD diagnosis,
   focusing on its subtle prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI) to assess essential features that characterize its early
   manifestation and to plan for early treatment. However, diagnosis of
   early MCI (EMCI) remains most challenging as it is extremely difficult
   to delineate from cognitively normal controls (CN), and as a
   consequence, most of the classification algorithms for these two groups
   are mixed with low classification accuracy results. In this study, a
   machine learning approach based on deep neural network (DNN) has been
   proposed in order to detect AD in its early stage using multimodal
   imaging, combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission
   tomography (PET) and standard neuropsychological test scores. The
   proposed approach makes use of the optimization method of Adam to update
   the learning weights in order to improve its accuracy. The algorithm is
   able to classify cognitively normal control group from EMCI with an
   unprecedented accuracy of 84.0\%. Although the focus here is
   distinguishing the two groups of CN and EMCI for early diagnosis and
   treatment planning, this study also shows how the proposed deep learning
   algorithm can be extended for multiclass classification involving CN and
   all the stages of EMCI, late MCI (LMCI) and AD.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer is a degenerative disorder that attacks neurons, resulting in
   loss of memory, thinking, language skills, and behavioral changes.
   Computer-aided detection methods can uncover crucial information
   recorded by electroencephalograms. A systematic literature search
   presents the wavelet transform as a frequently used technique in
   Alzheimer's detection. However, it requires a defined basis function
   considered a significant problem. In this work, the concept of empirical
   mode decomposition is introduced as an alternative to process Alzheimer
   signals. The performance of empirical mode decomposition heavily relies
   on a parameter called threshold. In our previous works, we found that
   the existing thresholding techniques were not able to highlight relevant
   information. The use of Tsallis entropy as a thresholder is evaluated
   through the combination of empirical mode decomposition and neural
   networks. Thanks to the extraction of better features that boost the
   classification accuracy, the proposed approach outperforms the
   state-of-the-art in terms of peak signal to noise ratio and root mean
   square error. Hence, our methodology is more likely to succeed than
   methods based on other landmarks such as Bayes, Normal and Visu shrink.
   We finally report an accuracy rate of 80\%, while the aforementioned
   techniques only yield performances of 65\%, 60\% and 40\%, respectively.}},

   impairment: the ADAS-Cog, MMSE, and sum-of-boxes Clinical Dementia
   Rating. Across all dMRI indices and cognitive measures, the
   cingulum-hippocampal region and the uncinate showed some of the
   strongest associations with cognitive impairment; largest effect sizes
   were detected with axial diffusivity (AxD(DTI) ). While fractional
   anisotropy (FA) derived from the DTI model was the weakest in detecting
   associations with cognitive measures, FA derived from the TDF detected
   widespread, robust associations. Protocol differences affected dMRI
   indices; however by modeling protocol effects, we were able to pool dMRI
   data from multiple acquisition protocols and detect consistent
   associations with cognitive impairment and age. dMRI indices computed
   from the upgraded scanning protocols in ADNI3 were sensitive to
   cognitive impairs lent in brain aging, offering a benchmark to compare
   to future multi-shell or multi-compartment diffusion indices.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) can be detected using magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) based features and supervised classifiers. The subcortical
   and ventricular volumes change for AD patients. These volumes can be
   extracted from MRI by tools such as FreeSurfer and the multi-atlas-based
   likelihood fusion (MALF) algorithm. Studies use MRI from many medical
   imaging centers. However, individual centers typically use distinctive
   MRI protocols for brain scanning. The protocol differences include
   different scanner models with various operating parameters. Some scanner
   models have different field strengths. A key factor in classifying
   multicentric MR subject images having different protocols is how
   different scanner models affect the extraction of feature, and the
   subsequent classification performance of a supervised classifier. We
   have investigated the classification performance of FreeSurfer and MALF
   based volume features together with Radial Basis Function Support Vector
   Machine and Extreme Learning Machine across different imaging protocols.
   We have also investigated for both FreeSurfer and MALF, which brain
   regions are most effective for the detection of the disease under
   different protocols. Our study result indicates marginal differences in
   classification performance across scanner models with the same or
   different field strengths when differentiating AD, Mild Cognitive
   Impairment, and Normal Controls. We have also observed differences in
   ranking order of the most effective brain regions.}},

Abstract = {{Deep learning has been applied to learn and classify brain disease using
   volumetric MRI scans with an accuracy approaching or even exceeding that
   of a human expert. This is typically done by applying convolutional
   neural networks to slices of a 3D brain image volume. Each slice of the
   brain volume, however, represents only a small cross-sectional area of
   the cortical layer. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks are
   less well developed for 3D volumes. Therefore we sought to apply deep
   networks to the 2D cortical surface, for the purpose of classifying
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is known to affect the thickness and
   geometry of the cortical surface of the brain. Although the cortical
   surface has a complex geometry, here we present a novel data processing
   method to feed the information of an entire cortical surface into
   existing deep networks for more accurate early disease detection. A
   brain 3D MRI volume is registered and its cortical surface is flattened
   to a 2D plane. The flattened distributions of the thickness, curvature
   and surface area are combined into an RBG image which can be readily fed
   to existing deep networks. In this paper, the ADNI dataset of brain MRI
   scans are used and flattened cortical images are applied to different
   deep networks including ResNet and Inception. Two pre-clinical stages of
   AD are considered; stable mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) and
   converting mild cognitive impairment (MCIc). Experiments show that using
   flattened cortical images consistently leads to higher accuracy compared
   to using brain slices with the same network architecture. Specifically,
   the highest accuracy of 81\% is achieved by Inception with flattened
   cortical images, as compared to 68\% by the same network on brain slices
   and 75.9\% accuracy by the best method in the literature which also used
   a deep network on brain slices. Our results indicate that flattened
   cortical images can be used to learn and classify AD with high accuracy.}},

Abstract = {{Various Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture has been
   proposed for image classification and Object recognition. For the image

   on 3D MRI becomes vague technique using 2D CNN architecture. Hence, to
   address this issue, we have simplified the idea of classifying patients
   on basis of 3D MRI but acknowledging the 2D features generated from the
   CNN framework. We present our idea regarding how to obtain 2D features
   from MRI and transform it to be applicable to classify using machine
   learning algorithm. Our experiment shows the result of classifying 3
   class subjects patients. We employed scratched trained CNN or pretrained
   Alexnet CNN as generic feature extractor of 2D image which dimensions
   were reduced using PCA+TSNE, and finally classifying using simple
   Machine learning algorithm like KNN, Navies Bayes Classifier. Although
   the result is not so impressive but it definitely shows that this can be
   better than scratch trained CNN softmax classification based on

Abstract = {{Although there is no cure 14 Alzheimer's disease (AD), an accurate early
   diagnosis is essential for health and social care, and will be of great
   significance when the course of the disease could be reversed through
   treatment options. Florbetapir positron emission tomography (F-18-AV-45
   PET) is proven to be the most powerful imaging technique to investigate
   the deposition of amyloid plaques, one of the potential hallmarks of AD,
   signifying the onset of AD before it changes the brains structure. In
   this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm to discriminate
   the patients having AD, early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI,
   and normal control in F-18-AV-45 PET using shearlet based deep
   convolutional neural network (CNN). It is known that the conventional
   CNNs involve convolution and pooling layers, which in fact produce the
   smoothed representation of data, and this results in losing detailed
   information. In view of this fact, the conventional CNN is integrated
   with shearlet transform incorporating the multiresolution details of the
   data. Once the model is pretrained to transform the input data into a
   better stacked representation, the resulting final layer is passed to
   softmnax classifier, which returns the probabilities of each class.
   Through experimental results, it is shown that the performance of the
   proposed classification framework is superior to that of the traditional
   CNN in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database in
   terms of classification accuracy. As a result, it has the potential to
   distinguish the different stages of AD progression with less clinical
   prior information.}},

Abstract = {{Although there is no cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), the early
   accurate prediction of clinical status plays a significant role in
   preventing, treating, and slowing down the progression of the disease.
   However, the absence of a single test and the complexity of AD create
   delays in diagnosis. In recent years, diagnosis of AD using different
   biomarkers through machine learning techniques has been the hottest
   research in the medical field. However, a common bottleneck of the
   diagnostic performance is overfitting due to having lot of irrelevant
   features in the training data. In view of this fact, we propose a novel
   classification framework which uses unsupervised autoencoder network to
   select the subset from given structural and clinical features by
   exploring the linear and nonlinear relationship among them followed by a
   supervised multinomial logistic layer to automatically identify the
   patients having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively
   normal (CN) clinical status. Through experimental results on Alzheimer's
   disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database, it is shown that the
   proposed classification algorithm achieves better performance in terms

Abstract = {{The fast and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) plays a
   significant part in patient care, especially at the early stage. The
   main difficulty lies in the three-class classification problem with AD,
   Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Cohort (NC) subjects, due to
   the high similarity on brain patterns and image intensities between AD
   and MCI's Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). So far, many studies have
   explored and applied various techniques, including static analysis
   methods and machine learning algorithms for Computer Aided Diagnosis
   (CAD) of AD. But there is still lack of a balance between the speed and
   accuracy of existing techniques, i.e., fast methods are not accurate
   while accurate algorithms are not fast enough. This paper proposes a new
   deep learning architecture to achieve the tradeoff between the speed and
   accuracy of AD diagnosis, which predicts three binary and one
   three-class classification in a unified architecture named 3D
   fine-tuning convolutional neural network (3D-FCNN). Experiments on the
   standard Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset
   indicated that the proposed 3D-FCNN model is superior to conventional
   classifiers both in accuracy and robustness. In particular, the achieved
   binary classification accuracies are 96.81\% and AUC of 0.98 for AD/NC,
   88.43\% and AUC of 0.91 for AD/MCI, 92.62\% and AUC of 0.94 for MCI/NC.
   More importantly, the three-class classification for AD/MCI/NC achieves
   the accuracy of 91.32\%, outperforming several state-of-the-art

Abstract = {{In recent years there have been many studies indicating that multiple
   cortical features, extracted at each surface vertex, are promising in
   the detection of various neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative
   diseases. However, with limited datasets, it is challenging to train
   stable classifiers with such high-dimensional surface data. This
   necessitates a feature reduction that is commonly accomplished via
   regional volumetric morphometry from standard brain atlases. However,
   current regional summaries are not specific to the given age or
   pathology that is studied, which runs the risk of losing relevant
   information that can be critical in the classification process. To solve
   this issue, this paper proposes a novel data-driven approach by
   extending convolutional neural networks (CNN) for use on non-Euclidean
   manifolds such as cortical surfaces. The proposed network learns the
   most powerful features and brain regions from the extracted large
   dimensional feature space; thus creating a new feature space in which
   the dimensionality is reduced and feature distributions are better
   separated. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed surface-CNN
   framework in an example study classifying Alzheimers disease patients
   versus normal controls. The high performance in the cross-validation
   diagnostic results shows the potential of our proposed prediction

Abstract = {{Deep learning has allowed scientists to make significant improvements in
   tasks that were once considered difficult in disparate domains. Medical
   imaging is one of those domains where traditional analysis entailed
   multiple preprocessing steps and feature extraction or handcrafting of
   individual features for specific applications. Deep learning allows one
   to simplify this analysis pipeline into an end-to-end framework as it
   can handle the feature extraction phase without having to handcraft
   features. We leverage this characteristic of deep learning and present
   an architecture where multiple information modalities of different
   complexities can be fused together seamlessly and co-optimized to create
   a robust classifier. The performance of this fusion pipeline is
   demonstrated on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI)
   dataset where discrimination between Alzheimer's Disease, Mild Cognitive
   Impairment and cognitively normal individuals using 3D magnetic
   resonance imaging and neuropsychological measures is presented.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a kind of neurodegenerative disorder with
   progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Structural
   magnetic resonance images (MRI) is widely used as an important imaging
   modality for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods for MRI
   classification are based on image data of single time point. However,
   the longitudinal analysis of sequential MR images is also important to
   model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis. In
   this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination
   of MultiLayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Recurrent Neural
   Networks (RNN) for longitudinal analysis of MR images for AD diagnosis.
   First, MLP is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images
   with the task of AD classification. After that, RNN with cascaded two
   bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is trained on the MLP
   outputs for extracting the longitudinal features from the imaging data
   of multiple time points, providing a final classification predicting
   score. The proposed method can automatically learn the spatial and
   longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points with
   variable length for classification. Our method is evaluated using
   T1-weighted structural MR images on 428 subjects including 198 AD
   patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show the
   proposed method achieves an accuracy of 89.7\% for AD classification,
   demonstrating the promising classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Multi-modality data are widely used in clinical applications, such as
   tumor detection and brain disease diagnosis. Different modalities can
   usually provide complementary information, which commonly leads to
   improved performance. However, some modalities are commonly missing for
   some subjects due to various technical and practical reasons. As a
   result, multi-modality data are usually incomplete, raising the
   multi-modality missing data completion problem. In this work, we
   formulate the problem as a conditional image generation task and propose
   an encoder-decoder deep neural network to tackle this problem.
   Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and
   generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial
   loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality
   images. At the same time, we propose to incorporate the available
   category information of subjects in training to enable the model to
   generate more informative images. We evaluate our method on the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, where
   positron emission tomography (PET) modalities are missing. Experimental
   results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET
   modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)

   detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease. Our results also show
   that the proposed methods generate higher quality images than baseline

Journal = {{COMPUTATIONAL AND MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN MEDICINE}},

Volume = {{2018}},
Abstract = {{The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of extending a
   previously developed amyloid biomathematical screening methodology to
   support the screening of tau radiotracers during compound development.
   22 tau-related PET radiotracers were investigated. For each radiotracer,
   in silico MLogP, V-x, and in vitro K-D were input into the model to
   predict the in vivo K-1, k(2), and BPND under healthy control (HC), mild
   cognitive impaired (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) conditions. These
   kinetic parameters were used to simulate the time activity curves (TACs)
   in the target regions of HC, MCI, and AD and a reference region.
   Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were determined from the
   integrated area under the TACs of the target region over the reference
   region within a default time window of 90-110min. The predicted K-1,
   k(2), and BPND values were compared with the clinically observed values.
   The TACs and SUVR distributions were also simulated with population
   variations and noise. Finally, the clinical usefulness index (CUI)
   ranking was compared with clinical comparison results. The TACs and SUVR
   distributions differed for tau radiotracers with lower tau selectivity.
   The CUI values ranged from 0.0 to 16.2, with 6 out of 9 clinically
   applied tau radiotracers having CUI values higher than the recommend CUI
   value of 3.0. The differences between the clinically observed TACs and
   SUVR results showed that the evaluation of the clinical usefulness of
   tau radiotracer based on single target binding could not fully reflect
   in vivo tau binding. The screening methodology requires further study to
   improve the accuracy of screening tau radiotracers. However, the higher
   CUI rankings of clinically applied tau radiotracers with higher
   signal-to-noise ratio supported the use of the screening methodology in
   radiotracer development by allowing comparison of candidate radiotracers
   with clinically applied radiotracers based on SUVR, with respect to
   binding to a single target.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage,
   i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and
   possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET),

   performs well on both largescale and small-size datasets. In this study,
   a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM- SDPN consists of
   two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation
   from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically
   speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI
   and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse
   multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is
   applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification

Abstract = {{Dementia has become a social problem in the aging society of advanced
   countries. Currently, 46.8 million people have dementia worldwide, and
   that figure is predicted to increase threefold to 130 million people by
   2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The
   cost of care for AD patients in 2015 was 818 billion US dollars and is
   expected to increase dramatically in the future, due to the increasing
   number of patients as a result of the aging society. However, it is
   still very difficult to cure AD; thus, the detection of AD is crucial.
   This study proposes the use of machine learning to detect AD using brain
   image data, with the goal of reducing the cost of diagnosing and caring
   for AD patients. Most machine learning algorithms rely on good feature
   representations, which are commonly obtained manually and require domain
   experts to provide guidance. Feature extraction is a time-consuming and
   labor-intensive task. In contrast, the 3D Convolutional Neural Network
   (3DCNN) automatically learns feature representation from images and is
   not greatly affected by image processing. However, the performance of
   CNN depends on its layer architecture. This study proposes a novel 3DCNN
   architecture for MRI image diagnosis of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease is
   increasing rapidly every year. Scholars often use computer vision and
   machine learning methods to develop an automatic diagnosis system.
   Objective: In this study, we developed a novel machine learning system
   that can make diagnoses automatically from brain magnetic resonance
   images.
   Methods: First, the brain imaging was processed, including skull
   stripping and spatial normalization. Second, one axial slice was
   selected from the volumetric image, and stationary wavelet entropy (SWE)
   was done to extract the texture features. Third, a single-hidden-layer
   neural network was used as the classifier. Finally, a predator-prey
   particle swarm optimization was proposed to train the weights and biases
   of the classifier.
   Results: Our method used 4-level decomposition and yielded 13 SWE
   features. The classification yielded an overall accuracy of 92.73 +/-
   1.03\%, a sensitivity of 92.69 +/- 1.29\%, and a specificity of 92.78
   +/- 1.51\%. The area under the curve is 0.95 +/- 0.02. Additionally,
   this method only cost 0.88 s to identify a subject in online stage,
   after its volumetric image is preprocessed.
   Conclusion: In terms of classification performance, our method performs
   better than 10 state-of-the-art approaches and the performance of human
   observers. Therefore, this proposed method is effective in the detection

Abstract = {{Our ever-aging society faces the growing problem of neurodegenerative
   diseases, in particular dementia. Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides a
   unique tool for non-invasive investigation of these brain diseases.
   However, it is extremely difficult for neurologists to identify complex
   disease patterns from large amounts of three-dimensional images. In
   contrast, machine learning excels at automatic pattern recognition from
   large amounts of data. In particular, deep learning has achieved
   impressive results in image classification. Unfortunately, its
   application to medical image classification remains difficult. We
   consider two reasons for this difficulty: First, volumetric medical
   image data is considerably scarcer than natural images. Second, the
   complexity of 3D medical images is much higher compared to common 2D
   images. To address the problem of small data set size, we assemble the
   largest dataset ever used for training a deep 3D convolutional neural
   network to classify brain images as healthy (HC), mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease (AD). We use more than 20.000
   images from subjects of these three classes, which is almost 9x the size
   of the previously largest data set. The problem of high dimensionality
   is addressed by using a deep 3D convolutional neural network, which is
   state-of-the-art in large-scale image classification. We exploit its
   ability to process the images directly, only with standard
   preprocessing, but without the need for elaborate feature engineering.
   Compared to other work, our workflow is considerably simpler, which
   increases clinical applicability. Accuracy is measured on the ADNI+AIBL
   data sets, and the independent CADDementia benchmark.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common brain dementia, which
   effects human memory, thinking and behavior. It has been proven that
   hippocampus is an important region related to AD diagnosis. Most of the
   existing methods on hippocampus analysis are based on the shape and
   volume analysis of the bilateral hippocampi. However, the 3D structural
   magnetic resonance images (MRI) can capture more useful information of
   hippocampus and its adjacent regions. In this paper, we propose a new
   method based on deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) for
   hippocampus analysis using 3D MR images for AD diagnosis. First, two
   hippocampi are segmented from other regions and the centers of
   hippocampus regions are calculated. Then, based on each hippocampus
   center, a local 3D image patch is extracted from the 3D MR image to
   cover each hippocampus region. Next, a deep 3D CNN model is constructed
   to extract the hierarchical imaging features for each hippocampus,
   followed by a softmax layer to generate a class prediction score for AD
   diagnosis. Finally, the classification is made by combination of the
   prediction scores from two hippocampi. Our method is evaluated using
   T1-weighted structural MR images on 231 subjects including 101 AD
   patients and 130 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show the
   proposed method achieves an accuracy of 86.98\% for classification of AD
   vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{Imaging connectomics emerged as an important field in modern
   neuroimaging to represent the interaction of structural and functional
   brain areas. Static graph networks are the mathematical structure to
   capture these interactions modeled by Pearson correlations between the
   representative area signals. Dynamical functional resting state networks
   seen in most fMRI experiments can not be represented by the classic
   correlation graph network. The changes in brain connectivity observed in
   many neuro-degenerative diseases in longitudinal data series suggest
   that more sophisticated graph networks to capture the dynamical
   properties of the brain networks are required. Furthermore, certain
   brain areas seem to act as ``disease epicenters{''} being responsible
   for the spread of neuro-degenerative diseases. To mathematically
   describe these aspects, we propose a novel framework based on pinning
   controllability applied to dynamic graphs and seek to determine the
   changes in the ``driver nodes{''} during the course of the disease. In
   contrast to other current research in pinning controllability, we aim to
   identify the best driver nodes describing disease evolution with respect
   to connectivity changes and location of the best driver nodes in
   functional F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography
   ((18)FDG-PET) and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
   connectivity graphs in healthy controls (CN), and patients with mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present the
   theoretical framework for determining the best driver nodes in
   connectivity graphs and their relation to disease evolution in dementia.
   We revolutionize the current graph analysis in brain networks and apply
   the concept of dynamic graph theory in connection with pinning
   controllability to reveal differences in the location of ``disease
   epicenters{''} that play an important role in the temporal evolution of
   dementia. The described research will constitute a leap in biomedical
   research related to novel disease prediction trajectories and precision
   dementia therapies.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition that
   can lead to severe cognitive and functional deterioration. Functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed abnormalities in AD in
   intrinsic synchronization between spatially separate regions in the
   so-called default mode network (DMN) of the brain. To understand the
   relationship between this disruption in large-scale synchrony and the
   cognitive impairment in AD, it is critical to determine whether and how
   the deficit in the low frequency hemodynamic fluctuations recorded by
   fMRI translates to much faster timescales of memory and other cognitive
   processes. The present study employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a
   Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to estimate spontaneous synchrony
   variations in the functional neural networks with high temporal
   resolution. In a group of cognitively healthy (CH) older adults, we
   found transient (mean duration of 150-250 ms) network activity states,
   which were visited in a rapid succession, and were characterized by
   spatially coordinated changes in the amplitude of source-localized
   electrophysiological oscillations. The inferred states were similar to
   those previously observed in younger participants using MEG, and the
   estimated cortical source distributions of the state-specific activity
   resembled the classic functional neural networks, such as the DMN. In
   patients with AD, inferred network states were different from those of
   the CH group in short-scale timing and oscillatory features. The state
   of increased oscillatory amplitudes in the regions overlapping the DMN
   was visited less often in AD and for shorter periods of time, suggesting
   that spontaneous synchronization in this network was less likely and
   less stable in the patients. During the visits to this state, in some
   DMN nodes, the amplitude change in the higher-frequency (8-30 Hz)
   oscillations was less robust in the AD than CH group. These findings
   highlight relevance of studying short-scale temporal evolution of
   spontaneous activity in functional neural networks to understanding the
   AD pathophysiology. Capacity of flexible intrinsic synchronization in
   the DMN may be crucial for memory and other higher cognitive functions.
   Our analysis yielded metrics that quantify distinct features of the
   neural synchrony disorder in AD and may offer sensitive indicators of
   the neural network health for future investigations.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, causing
   progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Radiomic
   features obtained from brain MRI have shown a great potential as
   non-invasive biomarkers for this disease; however, their usefulness has
   not yet been explored for individual brain regions. In this paper, we
   hypothesize that distinct regions are affected differently by AD and,
   thus, that shape or texture changes occurring in separate regions can be
   expressed by different radiomic features. Moreover, to improve the
   classification of AD and healthy control (HC) subjects, we propose novel
   features based on the entropy of the convolution neural network (CNN)
   feature maps. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively using
   the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. Our experiments
   assess the significance of 45 different radiomic features from
   individual subcortical regions, via the Wilcoxon test. We also use the
   random forest classifier to identify the subcortical regions that best
   differentiate AD patients from HC subjects. Our analysis identified the
   features derived from several subcortical regions that show significant
   differences between AD and HC (corrected p < 0.01). Specifically, we
   found correlation and volume features from the hippocampus (AUC =
   81.19\% - 84.09\%) and amygdala (AUC = 79.70\% - 80.27\%) regions to
   have the greatest discriminative power. Furthermore, the proposed
   entropy features derived from CNN layers yielded the highest
   classification AUC of 92.58\%, compared to 84.45\% for the combined
   radiomic features of all subcortical. These results suggest that the
   proposed CNN entropy features could be used as an effective biomarker
   for AD.}},

Abstract = {{Brain stimulation has emerged as an effective treatment for a wide range
   of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Parkinson's disease, epilepsy,
   and essential tremor have FDA indications for electrical brain
   stimulation using intracranially implanted electrodes. Interfacing
   implantable brain devices with local and cloud computing resources have
   the potential to improve electrical stimulation efficacy, disease
   tracking, and management. Epilepsy, in particular, is a neurological
   disease that might benefit from the integration of brain implants with
   off-the-body computing for tracking disease and therapy. Recent clinical
   trials have demonstrated seizure forecasting, seizure detection, and
   therapeutic electrical stimulation in patients with drug-resistant focal
   epilepsy. In this paper, we describe a next-generation epilepsy
   management system that integrates local handheld and cloud-computing
   resources wirelessly coupled to an implanted device with embedded
   payloads (sensors, intracranial EEG telemetry, electrical stimulation,
   classifiers, and control policy implementation). The handheld device and
   cloud computing resources can provide a seamless interface between
   patients and physicians, and realtime intracranial EEG can be used to
   classify brain state (wake/sleep, preseizure, and seizure), implement
   control policies for electrical stimulation, and track patient health.
   This system creates a flexible platform in which low demand analytics
   requiring fast response times are embedded in the implanted device and
   more complex algorithms are implemented in off the body local and
   distributed cloud computing environments. The system enables tracking
   and management of epileptic neural networks operating over time scales

Abstract = {{Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) hypothesize stereotyped progression
   via white matter (WM) fiber connections, most likely via trans-synaptic
   transmission of toxic proteins along neuronal pathways. An important
   question in the field is whether and how organization of fiber pathways
   is affected by disease. It remains unknown whether fibers act as
   conduits of degenerative pathologies, or if they also degenerate with
   the gray matter network. This work uses graph theoretic modeling in a
   longitudinal design to investigate the impact of WM network organization
   on AD pathology spread. We hypothesize if altered WM network
   organization mediates disease progression, then a previously published
   network diffusion model will yield higher prediction accuracy using
   subject-specific connectomes in place of a healthy template connectome.
   Neuroimaging data in 124 subjects from ADNI were assessed. Graph
   topology metrics show preserved network organization in patients
   compared to controls. Using a published diffusion model, we further
   probe the effect of network alterations on degeneration spread in AD. We
   show that choice of connectome does not significantly impact the model's
   predictive ability. These results suggest that, despite measurable
   changes in integrity of specific fiber tracts, WM network organization
   in AD is preserved. Further, there is no difference in the mediation of
   putative pathology spread between healthy and AD-impaired networks. This
   conclusion is somewhat at variance with previous results, which report
   global topological disturbances in AD. Our data indicates the combined
   effect of edge thresholding, binarization, and inclusion of subcortical
   regions to network graphs may be responsible for previously reported
   effects.}},

Abstract = {{T1-weighted MRI has been extensively used to extract imaging biomarkers
   and build classification models for differentiating Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) patients from healthy controls, but only recently have brain
   connectome networks derived from diffusion-weighted MRI been used to
   model AD progression and various stages of disease such as mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, as a possible prodromal stage of AD,
   has gained intense interest recently, since it may be used to assess
   risk factors for AD. Little work has been done to combine information
   from both white matter and gray matter, and it is unknown how much
   classification power the diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural
   connectome could provide beyond information available from T1-weighted
   MRI. In this paper, we focused on investigating whether
   diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome can improve
   differentiating healthy controls subjects from those with MCI.
   Specifically, we proposed a novel feature-ranking method to build
   classification models using the most highly ranked feature variables to
   classify MCI with healthy controls. We verified our method on two
   independent cohorts including the second stage of Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI2) database and the National Alzheimer's
   Coordinating Center (NACC) database. Our results indicated that 1)
   diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome can complement
   T1-weighted MRI in the classification task; 2) the feature-rank method
   is effective because of the identified consistent T1-weighted MRI and
   network feature variables on ADNI2 and NACC. Furthermore, by comparing
   the top-ranked feature variables from ADNI2, NACC, and combined dataset,
   we concluded that cross-validation using independent cohorts is
   necessary and highly recommended.}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a measurable deficit in
   cognition in the absence of dementia or impairment in activities of
   daily living. Working memory impairment is among the earliest signs of
   MCI. Oscillatory analysis of working memory might be a potential tool
   for identifying patients at increased risk of developing dementia. Our
   study aimed to assess the temporospatial pattern of spectral differences
   during working memory maintenance between MCI patients and healthy
   controls and to compare the sources of oscillatory activity between the
   two groups. Event-related spectral perturbation of 17 MCI patients and
   21 healthy control participants was studied with 128-channel EEG during
   the Sternberg working memory task. Source localization was performed by
   using the eLORETA software. Among the participants, 13 MCI and 15
   control participants underwent a structural brain MRI examination.
   Event-related synchronization (ERS) in the alpha and beta frequency band
   was significantly lower in MCI patients compared to healthy control
   participants during retention. Both study groups showed significant
   memory load-related enhancement in both frequency band. In the MCI
   group, source localization revealed significantly attenuated beta
   oscillatory activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyrus, in the
   fusiform gyrus, and in the cuneus. Beta ERS correlated significantly
   with the size of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal
   gyrus. During the retention period, MCI is characterized by decreased
   alpha and beta ERS compared to controls indicating early impairment in
   neural networks serving working memory maintenance. The assessment of
   electrophysiological changes in the beta frequency range may provide a
   useful diagnostic tool for the early detection of cognitive impairment.}},

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Precise measurements of visual fixation and its instability
   were recorded during optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a marker of
   neural network dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS), which could be
   used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment.
   METHODS. A total of 16 MS patients and 26 normal subjects underwent 30
   seconds of scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO)-based eye tracking during
   OCT scanning of retinal layer thickness. Study groups consisted of
   normal eyes, MS eyes without prior optic neuritis (MS wo ON), and MS
   eyes with prior optic neuritis (MS + ON). Kernel density estimation
   quantified fixation instability from the distribution of fixation points
   on the retina. In MS wo ON eyes, fixation instability was compared to
   other measures of visual and neurologic function.
   RESULTS. Fixation instability was increased in MS wo ON eyes (0.062
   deg(2)) compared to normal eyes (0.030 deg(2), P = 0.015). A further
   increase was seen for MS + ON eyes (0.11 deg(2)) compared to MS wo ON (P
   = 0.04) and normal (P = 0.006) eyes. Fixation instability correlated
   weakly with ganglion cell layer (GCL) volume and showed no correlation
   with low-contrast letter acuity, EDSS score, or SDMT score.
   CONCLUSIONS. Fixation instability reflects the integrity of a widespread
   neural network germane to visual processing and ocular motor control,
   and is disturbed in MS. Further study of visual fixation, including the
   contribution of microsaccades to fixation instability, may provide
   insight into the localization of fixation abnormalities in MS and
   introduce innovative and easily measured outcomes for monitoring
   progression and treatment response.}},

Abstract = {{The discrimination of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal
   form (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) from cognitively healthy
   control (HC) subjects is crucial since the treatment is more effective
   in the first stages of the dementia. The aim of our study is to evaluate
   the usefulness of a methodology based on electroencephalography (EEG) to
   detect AD and MCI. EEG rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI
   subjects and 37 HC subjects. Artifact-free trials were analyzed by means
   of several spectral and nonlinear features: relative power in the
   conventional frequency bands, median frequency, individual alpha
   frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central tendency
   measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information.
   Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast
   correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The
   selected features were used to train three different models aimed at
   classifying the trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
   discriminant analysis (QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural
   network (MLP). Afterwards, each subject was automatically allocated in a
   particular group by applying a trial-based majority vote procedure.
   After feature extraction, the FCBF method selected the optimal set of
   features: individual alpha frequency, relative power at delta frequency
   band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of features, MLP
   showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a
   subject is not healthy (sensitivity of 82.35\% and positive predictive
   value of 84.85\% for HC vs. all classification task) and whether a
   subject does not suffer from AD (specificity of 79.41\% and negative
   predictive value of 84.38\% for AD vs. all comparison). Our findings
   suggest that our methodology can help physicians to discriminate AD, MCI

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{214-228}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{The hippocampus is a particularly interesting target for neuroscience
   research studies due to its essential role within the human brain. In
   large human cohort studies, bilateral hippocampal structures are
   frequently identified and measured to gain insight into human behaviour
   or genomic variability in neuropsychiatric disorders of interest.
   Automatic segmentation is performed using various algorithms, with
   FreeSurfer being a popular option. In this manuscript, we present a
   method to segment the bilateral hippocampus using a deep-learned
   appearance model. Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have
   shown great success in recent years, due to their ability to learn
   meaningful features from a mass of training data. Our method relies on
   the following key novelties: (i) we use a wide and variable training set
   coming from multiple cohorts (ii) our training labels come in part from
   the output of the FreeSurfer algorithm, and (iii) we include synthetic

Abstract = {{Brain imaging signals obtained using different imaging modalities mostly
   reside on irregular structures. While most of the classical signal
   processing methods are designed for signals having a regular structure,
   a new field of signal processing called Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is
   growing rapidly which deals with the irregularly structured data. So,
   GSP has become a natural choice for many brain image analysis
   applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of detection of
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the early stages using fMRI data obtained
   from ADNI dataset. Firstly, we extract efficient discriminating features
   from resting state fMRI data using our novel hypothesis which is based
   on the outcomes of two neurological experiments carried out
   independently. Then we classify these graph signals by designing a
   classifier based on recently proposed graph convolutional neural network
   (GCNN). GCNN is the generalization of convolutional neural network (CNN)
   to the irregular domain using the concepts of GSP. We constructed brain
   graphs using different connectivity measures and compared the
   performance obtained using these graphs to find the best suitable
   connectivity measure for our application. Our proposed model outperforms
   state-of-the-art AD detection methods with a classification accuracy of
   92.44\%. This improvement can be associated with the fact that we first
   extracted highly discriminating features using graph frequency analysis
   performed with suitably constructed graphs and then applied properly
   designed GCNN classifier to classify the input graph signals.}},

Abstract = {{A recent imaging modality Diffusion Tensor Imaging completes information
   used from Structural MRI in studies of Alzheimer disease. A large number
   of recent studies has explored pathologic staging of Alzheimer disease
   using the Mean Diffusivity maps extracted from the Diffusion Tensor
   Imaging modality. The Deep Neural Networks are seducing tools for
   classification of subjects' imaging data in computer-aided diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's disease. The major problem here is the lack of a publicly
   available large amount of training data in both modalities. The lack
   number of training data yields over-fitting phenomena. We propose a
   method of a cross-modal transfer learning: from Structural MRI to
   Diffusion Tensor Imaging modality. Models pre-trained on a structural
   MRI dataset with domain-depended data augmentation are used as
   initialization of network parameters to train on Mean Diffusivity data.
   The method shows a reduction of the over-fitting phenomena, improves
   learning performance, and thus increases the accuracy of prediction.
   Classifiers are then fused by a majority vote resulting in augmented
   scores of classification between Normal Control, Alzheimer Patients and
   Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects on a subset of ADNI dataset.}},

Abstract = {{As reported by the the Alzheimer's Association, there are more than 5
   million Americans living with Alzheimer's today, with an anticipated 16
   million by 2050. The neurodegenerative disease is currently the 6th
   leading source of death in the US. In 2017 this disease would cost the
   nation \$1.1 trillion. 1 in 3 seniors die in Alzheimer's disease or
   another dementia. It kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer
   combined. {[}14] As of the this papers writing, detecting Alzheimer's is
   a difficult and time consuming task, but requires brain imaging report
   and human expertise. Needless to say, this conventional approach to
   detect Alzheimer's is costly and often error prone. In this paper an
   alternative approach has been discussed, that is fast, costs less and
   more reliable. Deep Learning represents the true bleeding edge of
   Machine Intelligence. Convolutional Neural Networks are biologically
   inspired Multilayer perceptron specially capable of image processing. In
   this paper we present a state of the art Deep Convolutional Neural
   Network to detect Alzheimer's Disease and Dementia from 3D MRI image.}},

Abstract = {{Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based early diagnosis of Alzheimer's
   Disease (AD), especially a discrimination between healthy control (HC)
   and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has received remarkable attentions
   to complement conventional diagnosing methods in clinical fields. A
   relative power (RP) metric which quantifies the abnormal EEG pattern
   `slowing' has widely been used as a major feature to distinguish HC and
   MCI, however, the optimal spectral ranges of the RP are influenced by
   the given dataset. In this study, we proposed the deep neural network
   based classifier using the RP to fully exploit and recombine the
   features through its own learning structure. The DNN enhanced the
   diagnosis results compared to shallow neural network, and enabled to
   interpret the results as we used the well-known RP features as the
   domain knowledge. We investigated and explored the potentials of DNN
   based detection of the early-stage AD.}},

   The longitudinal images of various subjects are obtained at different

   the number of image slices of GM images with combinations of different
   time points of scans or only the baseline visit. The classification

Abstract = {{Deep learning has revolutionized data analysis and particularly medical
   imaging, providing unprecedented insight to non-linear features. Image
   decomposition techniques such as Principal Component Analysis have been
   used for a long time, evolving towards complex non-linear decomposition
   algorithms. Convolutional networks, and particularly convolutional
   autoencoders are known for providing high-level abstract features that
   describe the internal distribution of data in high-dimensional
   manifolds. In this work, we aim at gaining a deeper understanding the
   progression of the disease by predicting neuropsychological test
   outcomes based solely on MRI data. In order to do so, we perform a
   self-supervised decomposition of the MRI data using a deep convolutional
   autoencoder. The distribution of features in the z-layer is then used
   within a neural network based regression, in order to test whether these
   imaging-derived biomarkers are related to several neuropsychological
   tests. The prediction of neuropsychological test outcomes achieved R-2
   rates up to more than 0.3, with correlations higher than 0.5 in the case
   of variables heavily linked to neurogedeneration and cognitive state
   such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores.}},

Abstract = {{The human brain consists of billions of neurons and their loss caused by
   neurodegenerative disorder dramatically affects cognitive brain
   functions. Such a state is known as Alzheimer's disease (AD). At this
   moment, AD remains without a decent cure, and its diagnosis mostly
   depends on the experience of clinicians; therefore, early diagnostics is
   critical because AD is progressive and at the beginning, its'
   development can be slowed down. In this paper, we use a deep learning
   advances to developed a classification system based on a 3D
   convolutional neural network for analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging
   (MRI) data collected for healthy individuals, patients with mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) and with AD. The dataset of MR images was
   collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI);
   spatially normalized with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox
   and the skull-stripped for better 3D-CNN (HadNet) training. The backbone
   of the HadNet architecture is to use stacked convolutions (inception
   approach) which allows accessing more internal features of the MR image
   related to the AD. The hyperparameters of the HadNet were fine-tuned
   through the Bayesian optimization process. The developed classifier does
   not use segmented brain regions and can automatically process the whole
   MR image and based on learned features, during training, detect to which
   class input belongs. In our work, we select three classes: Healthy, MCI
   and AD; the final 3D-CNN architecture consists of three inception
   blocks. The HadNet was end-to-end trained using MR brain scans of 530
   subjects including 185 AD patients, 185 MCI patients and 160 healthy
   individuals (HC). Evaluation results show that the trained classifier
   can distinguish between AD, MCI and HC with accuracy of 88.31\% what is
   a promising classification results.}},

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is critical in preventing
   from irreversible damages to brain cognitive functions. Most
   computer-aided approaches consist of extraction of image features to
   describe the pathological changes and construction of a classifier for
   dementia identification. Deep learning technique provides a unified
   framework for simultaneous representation learning and feature
   classification, and thus avoids the troublesome hand-crafted feature
   extraction and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose an
   ensemble of AlexNets (EnAlexNets) algorithm for early diagnosis of AD
   using positron emission tomography (PET). We first use the automated
   anatomical labeling (AAL) cortical parcellation map to detect 62 brain
   anatomical volumes, then extract image patches in each kind of volumes
   to fine-tune a pre-trained AlexNet, and finally use the ensemble of
   those well-performed AlexNets as the classifier. We have evaluated this
   algorithm against seven existing algorithms on an ADNI dataset. Our
   results indicate that the proposed EnAlexNets algorithm outperforms
   those seven algorithms in differentiating AD cases from normal controls.}},
