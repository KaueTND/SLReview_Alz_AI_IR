Florbetapir positron emission tomography (18F-AV-45 PET) is proven to be the most powerful imaging technique to investigate the deposition of amyloid plaques, one of the potential hallmarks of AD, signifying the onset of AD before it changes the brains structure. In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm to discriminate the patients having AD, early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI, and normal control in 18F-AV-45 PET using shearlet based deep convolutional neural network (CNN). It is known that the conventional CNNs involve convolution and pooling layers, which in fact produce the smoothed representation of data, and this results in losing detailed information. In view of this fact, the conventional CNN is integrated with shearlet transform incorporating the multiresolution details of the data. Once the model is pretrained to transform the input data into a better stacked representation, the resulting final layer is passed to softmax classifier, which returns the probabilities of each class. Through experimental results, it is shown that the performance of the proposed classification framework is superior to that of the traditional CNN in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database in terms of classification accuracy. As a result, it has the potential to distinguish the different stages of AD progression with less clinical prior information.","","978-1-5386-4859-9","10.1109/NEWCAS.2018.8585550","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8585550","Alzheimer’s disease (AD);Florbetapir positron emission tomography (¹⁸F-AV-45 PET) amyloid imaging;Shearlet transform (ST);Convolutional neural network (CNN);Softmax;Deep learning","Positron emission tomography;Feature extraction;Alzheimer's disease;Transforms;Databases","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;medical disorders;medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;positron emission tomography","convolutional network;multiclass diagnosis;florbetapir pet amyloid imaging data;accurate early diagnosis;treatment options;florbetapir positron emission tomography;F-AV-45 PET;powerful imaging technique;amyloid plaques;brains structure;novel classification algorithm;early mild cognitive impairment;late MCI;normal control;deep convolutional neural network;convolution;pooling layers;smoothed representation;multiresolution details;input data;stacked representation;classification framework;traditional CNN;Alzheimer disease neuroimaging initiative","","","","16","","23 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The hippocampus is a widely studied region of interest (ROI) for a number of reasons, such as memory function analysis, stress development observation and neurological disorder investigation. Moreover, hippocampal volume atrophy is known to be linked with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, several biomarkers, such as amyloid beta (aß42) protein, tau, phosphorylated tau and hippocampal volume atrophy, are being used to diagnose AD. In this research work, we have proposed a method to diagnose AD based on slice-wise volumetric features extracted from the left and right hippocampi of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. The proposed method is an aggregation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a deep neural network (DNN) model. The left and right hippocampi have been localized automatically using a two-stage ensemble Hough-CNN. The localized hippocampal positions are used to extract (80 × 80x80 voxels) 3-D patches. The 2-D slices are then separated from the 3-D patches along axial, sagittal, and coronal views. The pre-processed 2-D patches are used to extract volumetric features from each slice by using a discrete volume estimation convolutional neural network (DVE-CNN) model. The extracted volumetric features have been used to train and test the classification network. The proposed approach has achieved average weighted classification accuracies of 94.82% and 94.02% based on the extracted volumetric features attributed to the left and right hippocampi, respectively. In addition, it has achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 92.54% and 90.62% for the left and right hippocampi, respectively.

The advantage of this method lies in that we combined multimodal MRI information through CNN convolution kernel, and achieved a higher classification accuracy.

Following highly detailed preprocessing, four-dimensional (4D) fMRI and 3D MRI were decomposed to create 2D images using a lossless transformation, which enables maximum preservation of data details. The samples were shuffled and subject-level training and testing datasets were completely independent. The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted invariant and hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer. A decision-making algorithm was also designed to stabilize the outcome of the trained models. To measure the performance of classification, the accuracy rates for various pipelines were calculated before and after applying the decision-making algorithm. Accuracy rates of 99.77% ± 0.36% and 97.5% ± 1.16% were achieved for MRI and fMRI pipelines, respectively, after applying the decision-making algorithm.

The lack of sufficient data for training a deep model is a major challenge along this line of research. From our literature review, we realised that one of the current trends is using transfer learning for 2D convolutional neural networks to classify subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In this way, each 3D MRI volume is divided into 2D image slices and a pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network can be re-trained to classify image slices independently. One issue here, however, is that the 2D convolutional neural network would not be able to consider the relationship between 2D image slices in an MRI volume and make decisions on them independently. To address this issue, we propose to use a recurrent neural network after a convolutional neural network to understand the relationship between sequences of images for each subject and make a decision based on all input slices instead of each of the slices. Our results show that training the recurrent neural network on features extracted from a convolutional neural network can improve the accuracy of the whole system.","","978-1-7281-3745-2","10.1109/ICIAICT.2019.8784845","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8784845","deep learning;transfer learning;Alzheimer’s disease;convolutional neural networks;recurrent neural networks","Magnetic resonance imaging;Two dimensional displays;Deep learning;Diseases;Training;Neuroimaging;Convolutional neural networks","biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;recurrent neural nets","2D image slices;3D MRI volume;pretrained 2D convolutional neural network;deep learning techniques;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Alzheimer's disease detection;transfer learning;recurrent neural network","","1","","35","","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are widely used modalities to capture the structural changes in the brain caused by AD in its early stages. Early diagnosis of AD is important from clinical perspective to improve the life of an individual who is at the risk of developing memory deficits. Deep learning architectures such as 2D and 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have shown promising performances in extracting features and building useful representations of data for computer vision tasks. This study is geared towards understanding the performance differences between these architectures. We used transfer and non-transfer learning approaches to study the underlying disease phenomenon. In our experiments on binary classification of early stages of AD, we found the performance of 3D architectures to be better in comparison to their 2D counterparts. For instance, the 3D-CNN architecture which is trained on PET modality data achieved an accuracy of 71.728%, specificity of 73.196%, and sensitivity of 70.213% on the AD class while its 2D-CNN counterpart achieved an accuracy of 56.901%, specificity of 59.764%, and sensitivity of 53.947% on the same class.

Such a state is known as Alzheimer's disease (AD). At this moment, AD remains without a decent cure, and its diagnosis mostly depends on the experience of clinicians; therefore, early diagnostics is critical because AD is progressive and at the beginning, its' development can be slowed down. In this paper, we use a deep learning advances to developed a classification system based on a 3D convolutional neural network for analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected for healthy individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with AD. The dataset of MR images was collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); spatially normalized with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox and the skull-stripped for better 3D-CNN (HadNet) training. The backbone of the HadNet architecture is to use stacked convolutions (inception approach) which allows accessing more internal features of the MR image related to the AD. The hyperparameters of the HadNet were fine-tuned through the Bayesian optimization process. The developed classifier does not use segmented brain regions and can automatically process the whole MR image and based on learned features, during training, detect to which class input belongs. In our work, we select three classes: Healthy, MCI and AD; the final 3D-CNN architecture consists of three inception blocks. The HadNet was end-to-end trained using MR brain scans of 530 subjects including 185 AD patients, 185 MCI patients and 160 healthy individuals (HC).

Therefore, early detection of AD is crucial to start treatments to decelerate the progress of the disease and to maximize patients' quality of life. With the rapid advances in machine learning and scanning, early detection of AD may be possible via computer-assisted systems using neuroimaging data. Among all, deep learning utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become a prominent tool due to its capability to extract high-level features through local connectivity, weight sharing, and spatial invariance. This paper describes our investigation of the classification accuracy based on two publicly available data sets, namely, ADNI and OASIS, by building a 3D VGG variant convolutional network (CNN). We used 3D models to avoid information loss, which occurs during the process of slicing 3D MRI into 2D images and analyzing them by 2D convolutional filters. We also conducted a pre-processing of the data to enhance the effectiveness and classification performance of the model.

We propose a novel CNN framework to simultaneously learn embedded features from BFNs for brain disease diagnosis. Since BFNs can be built by considering both static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC), we first decompose rs-fMRI into multiple static BFNs with modified independent component analysis. Then, the voxel-wise variability in dynamic FC is used to quantify BFN dynamics. A set of paired 3D images representing static/dynamic BFNs can be fed into 3D CNNs, from which we can hierarchically and simultaneously learn static/dynamic BFN features. As a result, the dynamic BFN features can complement static BFN features and, at the meantime, different BFNs can help each other toward a joint and better classification. We validate our method with a publicly accessible, large cohort of rs-fMRI dataset in early-stage mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) diagnosis, which is one of the most challenging problems to the clinicians. By comparing with a conventional method, our method shows significant diagnostic performance improvement by almost 10%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in preclinical Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, based on the complex and high-dimensional voxel-wise spatiotemporal patterns of the resting-state brain functional connectomics. The framework provides a new but intuitive way to fully exploit deeply embedded diagnostic features from rs-fMRI for a better-individualized diagnosis of various neurological diseases.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2019.2928790","National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8765628","Diagnosis;convolutional neural networks;brain network;independent component analysis;mild cognitive impairment;deep learning;resting state;functional MRI","Convolutional neural networks;Neurophysiology;Brain;Deep learning;Feature extraction;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Image classification","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;independent component analysis;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","modified independent component analysis;voxel-wise variability;BFN dynamics;paired 3D images;3D CNNs;static BFN features;rs-fMRI dataset;early-stage mild cognitive impairment diagnosis;deep learning;preclinical Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;high-dimensional voxel-wise;resting-state brain functional connectomics;diagnostic features;dynamic brain functional networks;early MCI detection;convolutional neural network;hierarchical spatial features;medical images;resting-state functional MRI;CNN framework;brain disease diagnosis;static functional connectivity;dynamic functional connectivity;multiple static BFNs","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Deep Learning;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Middle Aged","5","","77","IEEE","17 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In recent times, several high-dimensional classification techniques have been suggested to discriminate between AD and MCI on the basis of T1-weighted MRI of patients. These techniques have been implemented mostly from scratch, making it really difficult to achieve any meaningful result within a short span of time. Therefore, the classification of AD is usually a very daunting and time-consuming task. In our study, we trained high dimensional Deep Neural Network (DNN) models with transfer learning in order to achieve meaningful results very quickly in terms of detecting AD from fMRI image. The fMRI image dataset has been collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We have used three different DNN models for our study: VGG19, Inception v3, and ResNet50 to classify AD, MCI, and Cognitively Normal (CN) patients. Firstly, we implemented some pre-processing steps on the images and divided them into training, testing, and validation sets. Secondly, we initialized these DNN models with the weights from pre-existing models trained on the ImageNet dataset. Finally, we trained and evaluated all the DNN models. After a relatively short amount of training (15 epochs), we achieved an approximate of 90% accuracy with VGG19, 85% accuracy with Inception v3, and 70% with ResNet50. Thus, we achieved excellent classification accuracy in a very short time with our research.

Early detection can prevent the patient from further damage to the brain cells and hence avoid permanent memory loss. In the past few years, various automatic tools and techniques have been proposed for the diagnosis of AD. Several methods focus on fast, accurate, and early detection of the disease to minimize the loss to a patient's mental health. Although machine learning and deep learning techniques have significantly improved medical imaging systems for AD by providing diagnostic performance close to the human level. But the main problem faced during multi-class classification is the presence of highly correlated features in the brain structure. In this paper, we have proposed a smart and accurate way of diagnosing AD based on a two-dimensional deep convolutional neural network (2D-DCNN) using an imbalanced three-dimensional MRI dataset. Experimental results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset confirms that the proposed 2D-DCNN model is superior in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and robustness. The model classifies MRI into three categories: AD, mild cognitive impairment, and normal control; and has achieved 99.89% classification accuracy with imbalanced classes.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal state of AD, which is further classified into a progressive state (i.e., pMCI) and a stable state (i.e., sMCI). With the development of deep learning, the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have made great progress in image recognition using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) for AD diagnosis. However, due to the limited availability of these imaging data, it is still challenging to effectively use CNNs for AD diagnosis. Toward this end, we design a novel deep learning framework. Specifically, the virtues of 3D-CNN and fully stacked bidirectional long short-term memory (FSBi-LSTM) are exploited in our framework. First, we design a 3D-CNN architecture to derive deep feature representation from both MRI and PET. Then, we apply FSBi-LSTM on the hidden spatial information from deep feature maps to further improve its performance. Finally, we validate our method on the AD neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset. Our method achieves average accuracies of 94.82%, 86.36%, and 65.35% for differentiating AD from normal control (NC), pMCI from NC, and sMCI from NC, respectively, and outperforms the related algorithms in the literature.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2913847","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province; Shenzhen Peacock Plan; Shenzhen Key Basic Research Project; Open Fund Project of Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Information Processing and Intelligent Control (Minjiang University); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8703035","Alzheimer’s disease;3D-CNN;FSBi-LSTM;multi-modal fusion","Magnetic resonance imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Kernel;Deep learning;Diseases;Two dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image recognition;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography","irreversible progressive neurodegenerative disorder;mild cognitive impairment;prodromal state;convolutional neural networks;CNNs;image recognition;MRI;positron emission tomography;PET;AD diagnosis;imaging data;deep learning framework;FSBi-LSTM;3D-CNN architecture;deep feature representation;deep feature maps;Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;magnetic resonance imaging;fully stacked bidirectional long short-term memory;AD neuroimaging initiative dataset;normal control","","14","","47","","30 Apr 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this model, we first extracted image features based on convolutional neural network (CNN) method, and then we used support vector machine (SVM) classifier to classify these features. The results showed that the classification accuracy using linear, polynomial and RBF kernel could achieve 91.0%, 90.0% and 92.3%.

Studies on MRI-based brain segmentation have received significant attention in recent years based on the non-invasive imaging and good soft-tissue contrast provided by MRI. A number of studies have used conventional machine learning strategies, as well as convolutional neural network approaches. In this paper, we propose a patch-wise M-net architecture for the automatic segmentation of brain MRI images. In the proposed brain segmentation method, slices from a brain MRI scan are divided into non-overlapping patches, which are then fed into an M-net model with corresponding ground-truth patches to train the network, which is composed of two encoder-decoder processes. Dilated convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in the encoder and decoder modules to derive abundant semantic features from brain MRI scans. The proposed patch-wise M-net overcomes the drawbacks of conventional methods and provides greater retention of fine details. The proposed M-net model was trained and tested on the open-access series of imaging studies dataset. The performance was measured quantitatively using the Dice similarity coefficient. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves average segmentation accuracies of 94.81% for CSF, 95.44% for GM, and 96.33% for WM, meaning it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006317","Korea government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9130719","Brain MRI;convolutional neural network;M-net;tissue segmentation","Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Feature extraction;Three-dimensional displays;Deep learning","biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;convolutional neural nets;diseases;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","patch-wise M-net architecture;brain MRI scan;nonoverlapping patches;M-net model;dilated convolutional kernels;patch-wise M-net convolutional neural network;brain tissue segmentation;white matter;magnetic resonance imaging images;noninvasive imaging;soft-tissue contrast;convolutional neural network approaches;ground-truth patches;MRI-based brain image segmentation;gray matter;cerebrospinal fluid;Alzheimer disease;schizophrenia disease;dementia;neurological disorder diagnosis;conventional machine learning;encoder-decoder processes;Dice similarity coefficient","","","","50","CCBY","1 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Early detection at the MCI stage can help determine appropriate treatment plans as well as assist in clinical trial enrollment as 32% of individuals with MCI will develop AD within 5 years. Computer vision studies leveraging Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI, fMRI), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) have led to encouraging results in classifying the different stages of AD. Studies around DTI specifically have shown that structural differences in white matter are prevalent between these stages. Rather than classification between stages, we propose a recurrent neural network model (RNN) based on the DTI modality for identifying the subset (32%) of individuals with Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) that will develop AD. Our results are state-of-the-art and demonstrate high accuracy in determining which individuals will develop AD within the next 5-7 years.

One popular choice for explaining deep image models is occluding regions of the image to isolate their influence on the prediction. However, existing methods for occluding patches of brain scans generate images outside the distribution to which the model was trained for, thus leading to unreliable explanations. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation method that is specifically designed for the brain scan task. Our method, which we refer to as Swap Test, produces heatmaps that depict the areas of the brain that are most indicative of AD, providing interpretability for the model's decisions in a format understandable to clinicians. Experimental results using an axiomatic evaluation show that the proposed method is more suitable for explaining the diagnosis of AD using MRI while the opposite trend was observed when using a typical occlusion test. Therefore, we believe our method may address the inherent black-box nature of deep neural networks that are capable of diagnosing AD.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206837","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206837","Explainable Deep Learning;Computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD);Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);Brain","Brain modeling;Magnetic resonance imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Solid modeling;Dementia","biomedical MRI;brain;convolutional neural nets;diseases;medical image processing;neurophysiology","Alzheimer's disease;deep CNN models;clinical reasoning;deep image models;brain scan task;explainable deep CNNs;MRI-based diagnosis;deep convolutional neural networks;semiautomated diagnosis;brain magnetic resonance imaging;swap test;axiomatic evaluation;occlusion test","","1","","54","","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This investigation studies a simple encoder based CNN with a sequential flow of features from low-level to high-level feature extraction. The idea is to present a diverging reception area by increasing the filter size and stride from a lower to a higher level. As a result, the feature redundancy is reduced and the trivial features keep on diminishing. The proposed architecture is referred to as `divNet', and several experiments were performed to determine how effective the architecture is in terms of the consumed memory, the number of parameters, running time, classification error, and the generalization error.

Most unfortunately, there is little chance of a cure for Alzheimer's disease, and the disease is difficult to detect before the dominant characteristics such as memory loss are manifested. Therefore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has become an urgent problem today. Studies have shown that mild cognitive impairment(MCI) is a state between Alzheimer's disease and normal, and the chance of it turning into Alzheimer's disease is high. Therefore, if machines can automatically learn the characteristics of three kinds of human brain magnetic resonance(MR) images through deep learning, and help doctors to diagnose patients with mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease accurately, it will be beneficial for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we improve the Inception(V3) neural network and further test the effectiveness of the enhanced network based on the international Alzheimer's disease data set, which consists of brain magnetic resonance images.

This would result in limited training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods focus only on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume) of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised densely connected neural network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract multiscale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly supervised densely connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training.

The hippocampus is one of the regions that can be affected by the Alzheimer's disease, and this region is known to be related to memory loss. The structural changes of the hippocampus are important biomarkers for dementia. To analyze the structural changes, accurate localization plays a vital role. Furthermore, for segmentation and registration of anatomical structures, exact localization is desired. Our proposed models use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to calculate displacement vectors by exploiting the Hough voting strategy from multiple 3-viewpoint patch samples. The displacement vectors are added to the sample position to estimate the target position. To efficiently learn from samples, we employed a local and global strategy. The multiple global models were trained using randomly selected 3-viewpoint patches from the whole MRI scan. The results from global models are aggregated to obtain global predictions. Similarly, we trained multiple local models, extracting patches from the vicinity of the hippocampus location and assembling them to obtain a local prediction. The proposed models exploit the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset and the Gwangju Alzheimer's and related dementia (GARD) cohort MRI dataset for training, validating and testing.

Brain tissue segmentation is an important aspect of clinical diagnostic tools, yielding excellent results compared to conventional segmentation methods or individual modalities. In this work, the Meta-Heuristic Markov Random Field Segmentation method is used to separate brain tissue, followed by the extraction of intensity, texture, and shape-based features of the segmented Cerebral Spinal Fluid (CSF) and Grey Matter (GM). With the proposed technique, the pre-processing of the input image improves quality and reduces noise. The segmentation is based on multilevel thresholding using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and further improving using Markov Random Field model. Segmented brain tissue (GM and CSF) are used to extract features on shape, intensity, and texture. The four-layer deep neural network is used to classify features.

One of the most serious challenges in the domain of a medical image analysis is the lack of manually annotated data. In this work, we use a relatively simple convolutional neural network to classify MRI images as either cognitively normal or those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Based on a quantitative analysis of multiple techniques, we propose to use a specific set of data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization of the deep neural network model. The proposed approach was compared with three different approaches using the same neural network - one approach with no data augmentation, one with regularization not specific to visual data (dropout and weight decay) and one with extensive data augmentation specific for images. We conclude that by using the proposed set of augmentation techniques, including novel perturbed normalization, we postponed overfitting, which resulted in a better generalized model.","2157-8702","978-1-7281-3227-3","10.1109/IWSSIP.2019.8787315","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8787315","3D CNN;Alzheimer’s disease;MRI;volumetric data augmentation","Magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Training;Task analysis;Three-dimensional displays;Biological neural networks;Brain modeling","biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","3D convolutional neural network;medical image analysis;deep learning;MRI classification;volumetrie data augmentation;deep neural network model;data augmentation techniques;Alzheimer's disease;MRI images","","","","24","","5 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this research work, we propose a deep learning-based method to automatically measure the discrete hippocampal volume without prior segmentation of the volumetric MRI scans. We constructed a 2-D convolutional neural network (CNN) model that uses 3-channel 2-D patches to predict the number of voxels attributed to the hippocampus; the number of estimated hippocampal voxels is multiplied by the voxel volume to measure the discrete volume of the hippocampus. In addition, we demonstrate a preprocessing scheme to prepare the data using a relatively small number of MRI scans. The average errors in the measured volumes of the proposed approach and the compared atlas-based system were 4.3173 ± 3.5436 (avg. error% ± STD) and 4.1562 ±3.5262 (avg. error % ± STD) for the left and right hippocampi, respectively. The correlation coefficients of the proposed approach with atlas-based volume measurement were statistically significant (p-value <; 0.01, R2 = 0.834 (left hippocampus), and R2 = 0.848 (right hippocampus) based on 0.05 significance level), which suggests that the proposed approach can be used as a proxy method for the atlas-based system. Furthermore, the proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires less than 2 seconds to calculate the number of voxels for an MRI scan.

Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub detection.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2019.2957921","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Royal Society-Academy of Medical Sciences Newton Advanced Fellowship; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; National Key R&D Program of China; National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8926342","Spatial-temporal dependency;neural network;Alzheimer's disease;hub detection;resting-state functional MRI","Time series analysis;Convolution;Dementia;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Brain modeling;Feature extraction","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;convolutional neural nets;data mining;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets;time series","discriminative brain regions;AD progression;STNet;spatial-temporal information mining;AD-related hub detection;end-to-end deep learning;rs-fMRI time series;overlapping sliding windows;local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns;disease diagnosis;whole-brain temporal dependency;spatially-dependent pattern sequences;disease progression prediction;spatial-temporal convolutional-recurrent neural network;long short-term memory;Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database;resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging;automated AD diagnosis;mild cognitive impairment;functional MRI analysis;network hub detection","","3","","60","IEEE","6 Dec 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The recent success of deep learning techniques has rapidly advanced the automatic classification of AD using neuroimaging biomarkers such as MRI. However, there exist two major challenges. First, training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch relies on a large number of labeled training data to obtain high accuracy without overfitting. Second, due to high computational cost, most of the existing techniques employ 2D CNN that cannot leverage the complete spatial information; hence, it loses the inter-slice correlation. To address these limitations, we combine a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) on top of the bottleneck layer of pre-trained DenseNet architecture, a deep CNN has already been trained on a large-scale dataset called ImageNet. In addition to the intra-slice features extracted from the deep CNN, the proposed technique exploits the inter-slice features through LSTM in order to discriminate the patients having AD and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status from the brain MRI data. Through experimental results, we show that our proposed model has better performance than state-of-the-art deep learning methods on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset using 5-fold cross validation.","","978-0-9964527-8-6","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9011301","Alzheimer's disease (AD);Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);Transfer learning;DenseNet;Long short-term memory (LSTM);Hybrid feature fusion","Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Training;Three-dimensional displays;Dementia;Machine learning","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","neuroimaging biomarkers;deep convolutional neural network;inter-slice correlation;recurrent neural network;RNN;LSTM;pre-trained DenseNet architecture;deep CNN;intra-slice feature extraction;inter-slice features;brain MRI data;state-of-the-art deep learning methods;hybrid feature fusion;pre-trained CNN;Alzheimer disease;open access series","","","","21","","27 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing machine/deep learning approaches typically preselect dementia-sensitive brain locations for MRI feature extraction and model construction, potentially leading to undesired heterogeneity between different stages and degraded prediction performance. Besides, these methods usually rely on prior anatomical knowledge (e.g., brain atlas) and time-consuming nonlinear registration for the preselection of brain locations, thereby ignoring individual-specific structural changes during dementia progression because all subjects share the same preselected brain regions. In this article, we propose a multi-task weakly-supervised attention network (MWAN) for the joint regression of multiple clinical scores from baseline MRI scans. Three sequential components are included in MWAN: 1) a backbone fully convolutional network for extracting MRI features; 2) a weakly supervised dementia attention block for automatically identifying subject-specific discriminative brain locations; and 3) an attention-aware multitask regression block for jointly predicting multiple clinical scores. The proposed MWAN is an end-to-end and fully trainable deep learning model in which dementia-aware holistic feature learning and multitask regression model construction are integrated into a unified framework. Our MWAN method was evaluated on two public AD data sets for estimating clinical scores of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating sum of boxes (CDRSB), and AD assessment scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Quantitative experimental results demonstrate that our method produces superior regression performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.

This paper proposes a novel GC model called back propagation (BP) based kernel function Granger causality (BP_KFGC), in which symplectic geometry is used for embedding dimension and fuzzy inference system for predicting time series. The proposed method doesn't depend on the prediction of the vector auto-regression model, so that time series don't need to be wide-sense stationary as linear GC and kernel GC. In addition, it is a multivariate approach which is applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems and eliminates the effects of latent variables. The performance of the new method is evaluated and compared with linear GC, partial GC, neural network GC and kernel GC by simulated data with multiple adjustments to the nonlinearity. The results show that BP_KFGC outperforms the other four methods in detecting both linear and nonlinear causalities. Furthermore, we applied BP_KFGC to construct directed weight network (DWN) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and health controls (HCs), and then nine graph-based features of DWN were used for classification by the classifier of support vector machine with radial basis kernel function.

Many studies now examine the connectivity and microstructure of the brain's neural pathways, spurring the development of algorithms to extract and measure tracts and fiber bundles. Clustering white matter (WM) fibers, from whole-brain tractography, into anatomically meaningful bundles is still a challenging problem. Existing tract segmentation methods use atlases or regions of interest (ROI) or unsupervised spectral clustering. Even so, atlas-based segmentation does not always partition the brain into a set of recognizable fiber bundles. Deep learning techniques can be applied to automatically segment and cluster white matter fibers. Here we propose a robust approach using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn shape features of the fiber bundles, which we then exploit to cluster WM fibers into bundles.

Particularly, in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disorder associated with network dysfunction, graph-based tools are vital for disease classification and staging. Here, we implement and test a multi-class GCNN classifier for network-based classification of subjects on the AD spectrum into four categories: cognitively normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late mild cognitive impairment, and AD. We train and validate the network using structural connectivity graphs obtained from diffusion tensor imaging data. Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we show that the GCNN classifier outperforms a support vector machine classifier by margins that are reliant on disease category.

Recent advances in deep learning have triggered a new era in AD/MCI classification and a variety of deep models and algorithms have been developed to classify multiple clinical groups (e.g. aged normal control - CN vs. MCI) and AD conversion. Unfortunately, it is still largely unknown what is the relationship between the altered functional connectivity and structural connectome at individual level. In this work, we introduced a deep cross-model attention network (DCMAT) to jointly model brain structure and function. Specifically, DCMAT is composed of one RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) layer and multiple graph attention (GAT) blocks, which can effectively represent disease-specific functional dynamics on individual structural network. The designed attention layer (in GAT block) aims to learn deep relations among different brain regions when differentiating MCI from CN. The proposed DCMAT shows promising classification performance compared to recent studies. More importantly, our results suggest that the MCI related functional interactions might go beyond the directly connected brain regions.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-9330-8","10.1109/ISBI45749.2020.9098638","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9098638","Attention;Alzheimer's disease;GAT","Brain modeling;Dementia;Correlation;Recurrent neural networks;Functional magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;recurrent neural nets","Alzheimer disease;deep cross-model attention network;mild cognitive impairment;deep learning;deep models;multiple clinical groups;functional connectivity;structural connectome;DCMAT;brain structure;Recurrent Neural Network;disease-specific functional dynamics;individual structural network;functional interactions","","","","26","","22 May 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

First, three levels of features are extracted: statistical, connectivity, and graph-based features. Then, the connectivity features are decomposed into three different sets of features according to a proposed similarity-driven ranking method, which can not only reduce the feature dimension but also increase the classifier's diversity. Last, after feeding the three levels of features to different classifiers, a new classifier selection strategy, maximum Mean squared Error (mMsE), is developed to select a pair of classifiers with high diversity. In order to do the majority voting, a decision-making scheme, a nested cross validation technique is applied to choose another classifier according to the accuracy.

Most of existing joint learning approaches require hand-crafted feature representations for MR images. Since hand-crafted features of MRI and classification/regression models may not coordinate well with each other, conventional methods may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also be related to brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic performance. However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate such demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we propose a deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM2L) framework for simultaneous brain disease classification and clinical score regression, using MRI data and demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we first identify the discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then extract multiple image patches around these detected landmarks. We then propose a deep multi-task multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint classification and regression. Our DM2L framework can not only automatically learn discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate the demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We evaluate the proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with 1984 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that DM2 L is superior to several state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2018.2869989","National Institutes of Health; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8463559","Anatomical landmark;brain disease diagnosis;classification;convolutional neural network (CNN);regression","Task analysis;Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Dementia;Convolutional neural networks;Education","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;regression analysis","joint classification;deep multitask multichannel learning;brain diseases;magnetic resonance imaging;joint learning approaches;hand-crafted feature representations;MR images;demographic information;learning models;simultaneous brain disease classification;clinical score regression;learning process;joint learning methods;computer-aided Alzheimer disease;suboptimal learning performance","Aged;Aged, 80 and over;Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Anatomic Landmarks;Brain;Deep Learning;Female;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male","11","","57","","12 Sep 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One who is diagnosed as an Alzheimer's disease patient may has many symptoms, such as deterioration of memory and language. Once those symptoms was noticed, they usually can survive 4 to 20 years. So far, Alzheimer's disease has become the sixth leading cause of death, and it has become a worldwide health and social challenge. Traditional methods of diagnosing AD and mild cognitive impairment(MCI), mostly depend on capturing features from variable modalities of brain image data. It is a big challenge to pick out the MCI from normal controller (NC) and AD, especially for those who are lacking experience. In this article, we employ deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) to extract the most useful features of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Firstly, the structural MRls are pre-processed in a strict pipeline. Then, instead of parcellating regions of interest, we re-slice each volume, and put the resliced images into a DCNN directly. Finally, four stages of Alzheimer's are identified, and the average accuracy is 94.5% for NC versus LMCI, 96.9% for NC versus AD, 97.2% for LMCI and AD, 97.81 % for EMCI versus AD, 94.8% for LMCI versus EMCI.

Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) is widely used as an important imaging modality for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods for MRI classification are based on image data of single time point. However, the longitudinal analysis of sequential MR images is also important to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis. In this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for longitudinal analysis of MR images for AD diagnosis. First, MLP is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images with the task of AD classification. After that, RNN with cascaded two bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is trained on the MLP outputs for extracting the longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points, providing a final classification predicting score. The proposed method can automatically learn the spatial and longitudinal features from the imaging data of multiple time points with variable length for classification. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted structural MR images on 428 subjects including 198 AD patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 89.7% for AD classification, demonstrating the promising classification performance.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-3636-7","10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363833","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363833","Alzheimer's disease;longitudinal study;Convolutional neural network;Recurrent neural network;Deep learning","Feature extraction;Time series analysis;Training;Logic gates;Data models;Diseases;Computational modeling","biomedical MRI;brain;brain models;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;multilayer perceptrons;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;recurrent neural nets","imaging data;multiple time points;longitudinal features;T1-weighted structural MR images;Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;AD classification;longitudinal analysis;Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;RNN;structural magnetic resonance images;AD diagnosis;MRI classification;sequential MR images;time axis;classification framework;MultiLayer Perceptron neural network;MLP;Recurrent Neural Networks;recurrent units layers;imaging modality;classification predicting score;spatial feature learning","","4","","21","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this work, we try a new exploratory data analysis of AD based on deep convolutional autoencoders. We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of neuropsychological test outcomes, diagnoses, and other clinical data with the imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis, and the influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is estimated.

In the recent decade, a variety of machine learning algorithms have been explored and used for AD diagnosis, focusing on its subtle prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to assess essential features that characterize its early manifestation and to plan for early treatment. However, diagnosis of early MCI (EMCI) remains most challenging as it is extremely difficult to delineate from cognitively normal controls (CN), and as a consequence, most of the classification algorithms for these two groups are mixed with low classification accuracy results. In this study, a machine learning approach based on deep neural network (DNN) has been proposed in order to detect AD in its early stage using multimodal imaging, combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and standard neuropsychological test scores. The proposed approach makes use of the optimization method of Adam to update the learning weights in order to improve its accuracy. The algorithm is able to classify cognitively normal control group from EMCI with an unprecedented accuracy of 84.0%. Although the focus here is distinguishing the two groups of CN and EMCI for early diagnosis and treatment planning, this study also shows how the proposed deep learning algorithm can be extended for multiclass classification involving CN and all the stages of EMCI, late MCI (LMCI) and AD.","","978-1-5386-6805-4","10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00218","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8614243","Artificial Intelligence;Deep Neural Network;MRI;PET;EMCI;Alzheimer's Disease","Conferences;Machine learning","biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;patient treatment;positron emission tomography;psychology","deep neural network approach;mild cognitive impairment;prevalent neurodegenerative disease;neuronal atrophy;amyloid deposition;psychological deficits;machine learning algorithms;AD diagnosis;early MCI;EMCI;classification algorithms;positron emission tomography;learning weights;treatment planning;deep learning algorithm;neuropsychological test scores;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal imaging;behavioral deficits;Alzheimer's disease","","","","18","","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, deep learning techniques are outperforming classical state-of-the-art methods and gradually becoming more mature. Consequently, deep learning has been extensively employed as a tool for precise segmentation of brain regions because of its capability to learn the intricate features of the high-dimensional data. In this work, a network for the segmentation of multiple brain regions has been proposed that is based on 3D convolutional neural networks and utilizes residual learning and dilated convolution operations to efficiently learn the end-to-end mapping from MRI volumes to the voxel-level brain segments. This research is focused on the segmentation of up to nine brain regions including cerebrospinal fluid, white matter and gray matter as well as their sub-regions. Mean dice scores of 0.879 and 0.914 have been achieved for three and nine brain regions, respectively by using the data from three different sources. Comparative analysis shows that our network gives better dice scores for most of the brain regions than state-of-the-artwork.

Therefore, early detection of AD is become an active research area in recent years. In this paper, we propose a deep based method for the detection of AD (i.e. classify brain images into normal brain or brain with AD). The proposed method contains two main steps. The first step is region of interest extraction; it is based on the partition of the image into separate blocks to extract only the part that contains the hippocampus of the brain. The second step is the classification of images using two deep based techniques namely convolutional neural network (CNN) and Transfer Learning. In one hand, CNN allows extracting the characteristics from brain images, then classifies them into normal brain or AD brain. Transfer Learning, in the other hand, consists of using features acquired from the Alexnet architecture to classify the images. We have assessed the proposed method on Oasis dataset (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies). The obtained results show that the classification of images using Transfer Learning with 92.86 % outperformed the CNN's classification rate.","2474-0446","978-1-7281-1080-6","10.1109/SSD49366.2020.9364155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9364155","Alzheimer's disease;Region of interest;Classification;Convolutional neural network;Transfer Learning;Alexnet","Brain;Quantization (signal);Transfer learning;Convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease;Public healthcare;Hippocampus","biomedical MRI;brain;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology","Alzheimer disease detection;convolutional neural networks;transfer learning;public health problem;neurodegenerative pathology;brain images;interest extraction;CNN;deep-based techniques;convolutional neural network","","","","23","","8 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain images are first mapped into anatomical VOIs using an atlas. Histogram-based features are then extracted and used to select and rank VOIs according to the area under curve (AUC) parameter, which produces a hierarchy of the ability of VOIs to separate between groups of subjects. The top-ranked VOIs are then input into a support vector machine classifier. The developed method is evaluated on a local database image and compared to the known selection feature methods.

This idea allows researchers to benefit from the concept of transfer learning. However, 2D CNNs are incapable of understanding the relationship among 2D image slices in a 3D MRI scan. One solution is to employ 3D CNNs instead of 2D ones. In this paper, we propose a method to utilise transfer learning in 3D CNNs, which allows the transfer of knowledge from 2D image datasets to a 3D image dataset. Both 2D and 3D CNNs are compared in this study, and our results show that introducing transfer learning to a 3D CNN improves the accuracy of an AD detection system.

However, the regions adjacent to hippocampus may be relevant to AD, and the visual features of the hippocampal region are important for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we have proposed a new hippocampus analysis method to combine the global and local features of hippocampus by three-dimensional densely connected convolutional networks and shape analysis for AD diagnosis. The proposed method can make use of the local visual and global shape features to enhance the classification. Tissue segmentation and nonlinear registration are not required in the proposed method.

In this work, we present a method for early diagnoses of AD by creating a low-cost EEG device along with using a deep neural network that can classify the suspected patients into three classes: MCI patients, AD patients, and healthy patients. This is done using collecting brain wave signals using Electroencephalography (EEG) device during a 3 level N-Back working memory test. This is called event-related potential (ERP), later the data will be cut into small frames, FFT transformed to extract brainwave subbands (theta, alpha, and beta) and then projected to 2D images where it will be used in training convolution neural network for classification. Early detection of Alzheimer will reduce the progression of AD at early stages. We implement and evaluate our hardware and classification with an accuracy of 90.36% for MCI and 92.52% for Alzheimer's disease detection.","","978-1-7281-4873-1","10.1109/GCIoT47977.2019.9058417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9058417","Alzheimer;Mild Cognitive impairment;early detection;Electroneuronography;Hardware;N-Back Test;Convolutional Neural Network;classification","Electroencephalography;Electrodes;Alzheimer's disease;Instruments;Hardware;Active filters","bioelectric potentials;cognition;convolutional neural nets;diseases;electroencephalography;fast Fourier transforms;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neurophysiology;signal classification","EEG data;deep neural networks classification;mild cognitive impairment;MCI patients;AD patients;brain wave signals;electroencephalography device;event-related potential;Alzheimer's disease detection;convolution neural network;3 level N-back working memory test;brainwave subbands;FFT;fast Fourier transforms","","","","13","","9 Apr 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, many computer-aided diagnosis techniques have been proposed for AD diagnosis and progression predictions. Among them, graph neural networks (GNNs) have received extensive attention owing to their ability to effectively fuse multimodal features and model the correlation between samples. However, many GNNs for node classification use an entire dataset to construct a large fixed-graph structure, which cannot be used for independent testing. To overcome this limitation while maintaining the advantages of the GNN, we propose an auto-metric GNN (AMGNN) model for AD diagnosis. First, a metric-based meta-learning strategy is introduced to realize inductive learning for independent testing through multiple node classification tasks. In the meta-tasks, the small graphs help make the model insensitive to the sample size, thus improving the performance under small sample size conditions. Furthermore, an AMGNN layer with a probability constraint is designed to realize node similarity metric learning and effectively fuse multimodal data. We verified the model on two tasks based on the TADPOLE dataset: early AD diagnosis and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction. Our model provides excellent performance on both tasks with accuracies of 94.44% and 87.50% and median accuracies of 94.19% and 86.25%, respectively. These results show that our model improves flexibility while ensuring a good classification performance, thus promoting the development of graph-based deep learning algorithms for disease diagnosis.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2021.3053568","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335007","Alzheimer's disease;Early diagnosis;Conversion prediction;Graph neural network;Meta-learning","Task analysis;Diseases;Magnetic resonance imaging;Graph neural networks;Testing;Training;Predictive models","","","","","","","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

However, current semi-quantitative methods that quantify Aβ using the Standardized Uptake Values Ratio (SUVr) cannot distinguish between the specific binding of radiotracers to Aβ and non-specific binding to other targets. In this paper, we propose a novel method to predict non-specific binding from MR images using deep learning by developing a novel conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) to improve Aβ quantification. PET images with low amyloid load were selected to represent non-specific uptake of the Aβ [11C]PiB radiotracer. Paired MR and PET images with low amyloid load were used for training, with the MRI image as the network input and the PET image as the training label. The cGAN was trained to learn the mapping between the MR image and the non-specific PET image. The generated non-specific PET images were compared to the real PET scans, achieving a mean SUVr difference of 1.90% in the gray matter.

In order to diagnose the disease more accurately, machine learning has been widely used. However, deep learning still has a broad application space. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) is high-performance model for deep learning. In this study, we constructed a Daul input encoder convolutional neural network (DIE-CNN) for event related potential (ERP) data with type 2 diabetes.

So, we carried out our studies by collecting the images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. Later, we have categorized the collected MRI images into three different groups based on the size of a ventricular region of the brain and then employed second and higher order statistical methods to extract the textural features from each image. Thus, we obtain multiple textural features using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Law Texture Energy Measure. After obtaining the textural features, the top matched images are retrieved based on the similarity measure computed between the feature vector of a query image and the images present in the database. Finally, the retrieval performance is compared for the extracted texture features from GLCM, Laws Texture Energy Measure and a combination of these two methods. The combination of features from the above methods shows the better precision of 80% and 60 % in the retrieval of Group1 and Group3 images.","","978-1-5386-8075-9","10.1109/I2CT45611.2019.9033832","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9033832","Alzheimer’s Disease;Content-based Image Retrieval;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Textural Features.","Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Image retrieval;Medical diagnostic imaging;Statistical analysis","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image retrieval;image texture;medical image processing;statistical analysis","Group1 images;GLCM;gray level cooccurrence matrix;statistical methods;ventricular region;open access series;magnetic resonance imaging;law texture energy measurement;Group3 images;extracted texture features;query image;matched images;MRI images;image retrieval technique;medical labs;healthcare;digital images;Alzheimer disease","","","","10","","12 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There is a need to examine the pathology variation to discriminate the disorder to provide appropriate treatment strategies. This study investigates about the brain tissue variations to identify the subtle change in progression. The considered normal, MCI and AD magnetic resonance (MR) images are obtained from Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In this work, multilevel Tsallis based grey wolf optimization (GWO) is used to segment the brain tissues. Then the feature is extracted from segmented white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) using convolution neural network (CNN). The obtained deep features are given to principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a prominent feature set for normal, MCI and AD. Further the tissue variation of optimized deep features is analyzed using support vector machine (SVM). The results shows that Tsallis based GWO perform reliable tissue segmentation for normal, MCI and AD. The deep features are able to observe discrimination than the fully considered feature set. Finally, the classifier result shows distinct tissue variation among normal, MCI and AD subjects. Further the prominent features give a classification accuracy of 77%, 80.22% and 78.7% for WM, GM and CSF respectively. This concludes that GM variation is a close biological substrate of dementia progressive condition than the effects of time or aging.

The main objective of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop a dementia of AD type among MCI patients. 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG PET) serves as a neuroimaging modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect neural activity via measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we design a deep network on 18F-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable Pyramid Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are learned from axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to offer complementary information and then combined to make a decision jointly. Different from the widely and naturally used 3D convolution operations for 3D images, the proposed architecture is deployed with separable convolution from slice-wise to spatial-wise successively, which can retain the spatial information and reduce training parameters compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively. Experiments on ADNI dataset show that the proposed method can yield better performance than both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for predicting the progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment, with a classification accuracy of 83.05%.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.3022591","Initiative d’Excellence Aix-Marseille (A*MIDEX) Project, through the framework of Départment Hospitalo-Universitaire (DHU)-imaging; [“Investissements d’Avenir” French Government Program, managed by the French National Research Agency (ANR)]; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9187697","Separable convolution;slice-wise CNN;spatial-wise CNN;¹⁸F-FDG PET;mild cognitive impairment","Three-dimensional displays;Feature extraction;Positron emission tomography;Dementia;Two dimensional displays;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neuroimaging","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;convolutional neural nets;deep learning (artificial intelligence);diseases;geriatrics;image classification;medical image processing;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis;positron emission tomography","mild cognitive impairment;elderly people;alzheimer's disease diagnosis;prodromal stage;MCI patients;F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography;neuroimaging modality;deep network;3D convolution operations;separable convolution;F-FDG brain PET imaging;multiview separable pyramid network;image classification;deep learning-based algorithms;dementia;glucose uptake measurement","","","","57","IEEE","7 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, Parkinson's disease (PD) is defined by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta within the midbrain. AD and PD are affecting millions of elderly people worldwide which highlights the need for their early diagnosis for the welfare of subjects diagnosed with these neurodegenerative disorders. A large number of autopsy confirmed PD subjects have sufficient postmortem plaque and tangle pathology to meet criteria for a second diagnosis of AD. Neuroimaging modalities such as Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) are routinely used by clinicians to diagnose the initial stages of these two diseases. Together with these neuroimaging modalities, deep learning techniques are widely used in medical settings and have the potential to aid clinicians in the early diagnosis of these two diseases. In this work, we deployed a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) forjoint feature extraction and multiclass classification of both AD and PD brain images in the spatial and frequency domains using PET and SPECT imaging modalities discriminating between AD, PD and Normal Control (NC) classes. We used Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as the frequency domain method and deployed random weak Gaussian blurring and random zooming in/out augmentation methods in both spatial and frequency domains. Based on our experiments and deployment of cross-validation approach for optimal hyperparameters selection, we found the performance of AD/NC(SPECT)/PD classification with random weak Gaussian blurred augmentation in the spatial domain to be the best and that of AD/NC(SPECT)/PD classification with combined augmentations in the frequency domain to be the worst while spatial domain methods outperformed their frequency domain counterparts.","","978-1-7281-6215-7","10.1109/BIBM49941.2020.9313341","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9313341","Multiclass Classification;Convolutional Neural Networks;Alzheimer’s Disease;Parkinson’s Disease;Positron Emission Tomography;Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography","","brain;convolutional neural nets;discrete cosine transforms;diseases;feature extraction;geriatrics;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;molecular biophysics;neurophysiology;proteins;single photon emission computed tomography","joint multiclass classification;Parkinson disease;neuroimaging modalities;tau plaques;dopaminergic neurons;pateint diagnosis;neurodegenerative disorders;PD subjects;tangle pathology;positron emission tomography;PET;single photon emission computed tomography;diseases;deep learning techniques;3D convolutional neural network;PD brain images;spatial frequency domains;SPECT imaging modalities;frequency domain method;random zooming;spatial domain methods;frequency domain counterparts;postmortem plaque;random weak Gaussian blurred augmentation;discrete cosine transform;NC","","","","34","","13 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This system lets us upload a brain MRI image and tells us whether or not that person has Alzheimer's disease. Currently, doctors and radiologists read the MRI image and detect the disease. But doctors are humans, prone to error. Also, what differentiates doctors is not their knowledge. It's determines how they approach the problem to interpret the health model which will support them. Radiologists regularly disagree of their respective interpretations of medical images - false positives and false negatives. AI can do what no radiologist can! - AI has the ability to learn from hundreds of thousands of medical images & is estimated to be upto 10% more accurate than an average radiologist.

Since it extracts the low-level features from the neuroimaging data, previous methods regarded this computer-aided diagnosis as a classification problem that ignored latent featurewise relation. However, it is known that multiple brain regions in the human brain are anatomically and functionally interlinked according to the current neuroscience perspective. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the extracted features from different brain regions are related to each other to some extent. Also, the complementary information between different neuroimaging modalities could benefit multimodal fusion. To this end, we consider leveraging the coupled interactions in the feature level and modality level for diagnosis in this paper. First, we propose capturing the feature-level coupled interaction using a coupled feature representation. Then, to model the modality-level coupled interaction, we present two novel methods: 1) the coupled boosting (CB) that models the correlation of pairwise coupled-diversity on both inconsistently and incorrectly classified samples between different modalities and 2) the coupled metric ensemble (CME) that learns an informative feature projection from different modalities by integrating the intrarelation and interrelation of training samples. We systematically evaluated our methods with the AD neuroimaging initiative data set. By comparison with the baseline learning-based methods and the state-of-the-art methods that are specially developed for AD/MCI (mild cognitive impairment) diagnosis, our methods achieved the best performance with accuracy of 95.0% and 80.7% (CB), 94.9% and 79.9% (CME) for AD/NC (normal control), and MCI/NC identification, respectively.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2019.2900077","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Young Elite Scientists Sponsorship Program China Association for Science and Technology; China Computer Federation-Tencent Open Research Fund; NIH Clinical Center; Institute of Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation Grant through the Korea Government; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8672088","Computer-aided AD/MCI diagnosis;coupled boosting (CB);coupled feature (CFR) representation;coupled metric ensemble (CME)","Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Neuroimaging;Measurement;Kernel;Training;Brain modeling","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image representation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","coupled metric ensemble;informative feature projection;AD neuroimaging initiative data;baseline learning-based methods;incorrectly classified samples;inconsistently classified samples;pairwise coupled-diversity;coupled boosting;modality-level coupled interaction;coupled feature representation;feature-level coupled interaction;modality level;feature level;coupled interactions;multimodal fusion;neuroimaging modalities;complementary information;brain regions;current neuroscience perspective;human brain;multiple brain regions;latent featurewise relation;classification problem;neuroimaging data;low-level features;neurodegeneration care;accurate computer-aided diagnosis;multimodal Alzheimer's disease","Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted;Humans;Machine Learning;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer;Neuroimaging;Positron-Emission Tomography;Reproducibility of Results","4","","82","IEEE","20 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this article, we propose a novel anatomical landmarks and directed acyclic graph (DAG) network feature learning based classification algorithm for the diagnosis of AD individuals. First, the anatomical feature patches of gray matter image are identified by the morphological and statistical analysis. Second, a simple and efficient DAG convolutional neural network is proposed to extract the discriminative deep features of image representation. Especially, the deep features are obtained by fusing feature maps of different network levels which contain semantic high-level and high-resolution low-level features. Finally, support vector machine and deep features are utilized to construct the classification model and predict the individual of AD.

Generically regarding the different neuroimaging modalities as filtered, complementary insights of brain's anatomical and functional organization, multimodal data fusion could be hypothesized to enhance the predictive power as compared to a unimodal prediction of disease progression. More recently, deep learning (DL) based methods on structural MRI (sMRI) data have outperformed classical machine learning approaches in several neuroimaging applications including diagnostic classification and prediction. Similarly, functional MRI (fMRI) features estimated using a dynamic (i.e. time-varying) functional connectivity (FC) approach have been found to be more discriminative and predictive of the clinical diagnosis than those based on the static FC approach. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel multimodal data fusion framework featuring deep residual learning of non-linear sMRI features and dynamic FC (dFC) based extraction of fMRI features to predict the subset of individuals with mild cognitive impairments who would progress to Alzheimer's disease within a time-period of three years from the baseline scanning sessions. Our cross-validated results from the developed multimodal (sMRI-fMRI) data fusion framework demonstrate a significant improvement in performance over the unimodal prediction analyses with the fMRI (p = 7.03 x 10-7) and sMRI (p = 6.72 x 10-4) modalities. As such, the findings in this work highlight the benefits of combining multiple neuroimaging data modalities via data fusion, corroborate the predictive value of the tested DL and dFC features and argue in favor of exploration of similar approaches to learn neuroanatomical and functional alterations in the neuroimaging data.","1558-4615","978-1-5386-1311-5","10.1109/EMBC.2019.8856500","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8856500","","Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Feature extraction;Correlation;Support vector machines;Data integration;Neuroimaging","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;sensor fusion","dynamic functional connectivity features;Alzheimer's disease progression;diseased brain conditions;illness;neuroimaging modality;deep learning based methods;structural MRI data;neuroimaging applications;diagnostic classification;functional MRI features;deep residual learning;nonlinear sMRI features;dynamic FC based extraction;fMRI features;sMRI-fMRI;unimodal prediction analyses;multiple neuroimaging data modalities;neuroanatomical alterations;functional alterations;irreversible neuronal dysfunction;multimodal data fusion framework;clinical diagnosis;mild cognitive impairments","Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Deep Learning;Disease Progression;Forecasting;Humans;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neuroimaging","","","17","","7 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This is typically done by applying convolutional neural networks to slices of a 3D brain image volume. Each slice of the brain volume, however, represents only a small cross-sectional area of the cortical layer. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks are less well developed for 3D volumes. Therefore we sought to apply deep networks to the 2D cortical surface, for the purpose of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is known to affect the thickness and geometry of the cortical surface of the brain. Although the cortical surface has a complex geometry, here we present a novel data processing method to feed the information of an entire cortical surface into existing deep networks for more accurate early disease detection. A brain 3D MRI volume is registered and its cortical surface is flattened to a 2D plane. The flattened distributions of the thickness, curvature and surface area are combined into an RBG image which can be readily fed to existing deep networks. In this paper, the ADNI dataset of brain MRI scans are used and flattened cortical images are applied to different deep networks including ResNet and Inception. Two pre-clinical stages of AD are considered; stable mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) and converting mild cognitive impairment (MCIc). Experiments show that using flattened cortical images consistently leads to higher accuracy compared to using brain slices with the same network architecture. Specifically, the highest accuracy of 81% is achieved by Inception with flattened cortical images, as compared to 68% by the same network on brain slices and 75.9% accuracy by the best method in the literature which also used a deep network on brain slices.

The current researches of MCI classification are mainly based on static low-order functional connectivity network (FCN) and image information. However, static FCN cannot reflect time-varying dynamic behavior, low-order FCN overlooks inter-region interactions, and ignoring non-image information is not suitable especially when the size of dataset is small. In this paper, a method based on a combined high-order network and graph convolutional network (GCN) is proposed. The combined high-order network combines static, dynamic and high-level information to construct FCN while GCN is used to include non-image information to improve classifier's performance. Firstly, dynamic FCNs and static FCN are constructed by using a sliding window approach. Secondly, dynamic high-order FCNs and static high-order FCN based on the topographical similarity are then constructed. Thirdly, a novel combination method is proposed to utilize dynamic high-order FCNs and static high-order FCN to form a combined high-order FCN. Fourthly, features of the combined high-order FCNs are extracted by using a recursive feature elimination method. Lastly, after inputting extracted features into the GCN, in which MCI-graph establishes interactions between individuals and populations by using non-image information, the GCN outputs the binary classification results. Experimental results on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (adni.loni.ucla.edu) show that our framework has good performance.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2974997","China Postdoctoral Science Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9003258","Mild cognitive impairment;binary classification;combined high-order network;graph convolutional network","Feature extraction;Microsoft Windows;Time series analysis;Windows;Diseases;Sociology","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;medical image processing;neurophysiology","mild cognitive impairment;high-order network;graph convolutional network;image information;time-varying dynamic behavior;low-order FCN;nonimage information;high-level information;static high-order FCN;Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset;binary classification;recursive feature elimination method;dynamic high-order FCN;sliding window approach;interregion interactions","","","","48","CCBY","19 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, early detection of the disease is crucial in order to improve the quality of life of the patients and to decrease the burden of their caregiver and clinicians. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of progressing to Alzheimer's disease which should be focus on. In this paper, we have proposed a screening system based on the Rey-osterrieth Complex Figure, a neuropsychological test, that can automatically assist the clinicians to detect whether the subject is MCI or not. A data-driven deep learning approach is implemented in this work. Convolution autoencoder is designed initially to extract features from the input image. The features learned by the encoder are then used for further training the classifier. In order to validate the performance of our work, 59 MCI subjects and 59 healthy controls are recruited under the approval of institutional review board from the National Taiwan University Hospital. The performance of our proposed model is evaluated by using 10-fold cross-validation and it is repeated five times.

This paper presents a novel solution in the early detection of pMCI people and classification of AD risk within MCI people. We proposed a model, MudNet, to utilise deep learning in the simultaneous prediction of progressive/stable MCI classes and time-to-AD conversion where high-risk pMCI people see conversion to AD within 24 months and low-risk people greater than 24 months. MudNet is trained and validated using baseline clinical and volumetric MRI data (n = 559 scans) from participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). The model utilises T1-weighted structural MRIs alongside clinical data which also contains neuropsychological (RAVLT, ADAS-11, ADAS-13, ADASQ4, MMSE) tests as inputs.

Although the ResNetworks better compared with the machine learning methods. How-ever, the performance of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) andNormal Control (NC) recognition is poor due to the insignificantdifference in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain imagefeatures. In this paper, the selective kernel network (SKNet) andchannel shuffle are introduced in the Resnet network, and anenhanced Resnet (EResNet) is proposed to accurately diagnosethe AD symptoms. The method solves the influence of the multiplescales of input information on the network through SKNet, andevenly disturbs the channel feature through the channel shuffle, so that the network can fully utilize the feature information ofthe input image to improve the network identification capability. To evaluate the performance of the EResNet, MRI images of thebrain were used to diagnosis of AD. The classification accuracyin AD / MCI and MCI / NC control groups reached 96.47% and90.70%.

In this work, we present a method for generating realistic motion artefacts from artefact-free magnitude MRI data to be used in deep learning frameworks, increasing training appearance variability and ultimately making machine learning algorithms such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) more robust to the presence of motion artefacts. By modelling patient movement as a sequence of randomly-generated, `demeaned', rigid 3D affine transforms, we resample artefact-free volumes and combine these in k-space to generate motion artefact data. We show that by augmenting the training of semantic segmentation CNNs with artefacts, we can train models that generalise better and perform more reliably in the presence of artefact data, with negligible cost to their performance on clean data. We show that the performance of models trained using artefact data on segmentation tasks on real-world test-retest image pairs is more robust. We also demonstrate that our augmentation model can be used to learn to retrospectively remove certain types of motion artefacts from real MRI scans. Finally, we show that measures of uncertainty obtained from motion augmented CNN models reflect the presence of artefacts and can thus provide relevant information to ensure the safe usage of deep learning extracted biomarkers in a clinical pipeline.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.2972547","Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (National Institutes of Health); DOD ADNI (Department of Defence Award); EPSRC CASE Studentship; Alzheimer’s Society Fellowship; Wellcome Flagship Programme; Welcome EPSRC CME; NIHR GSTT BRC; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9025260","MRI;motion artefacts;deep learning;segmentation;data augmentation;artefact correction;uncertainty","Three-dimensional displays;Transforms;Machine learning;Solid modeling;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging;Data models","affine transforms;biomechanics;biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;image motion analysis;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","k-space;movement artefacts;segmentation augmentation;artefact removal;magnetic resonance images;image artefacts;automated image analysis;motion artefacts;deep learning;machine learning;patient movement;semantic segmentation CNNs;real-world test-retest image pairs;artefact-free magnitude MRI;artefact-free volumes;motion augmented CNN;convolutional neural networks;rigid 3D affine transforms","","1","","24","IEEE","5 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It is the most common form of dementia and accounts for 60-80% of all dementia cases. There is no single test for diagnosis of AD, the doctors rely on medical history, neuropsychological assessments, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain, etc. to confirm a diagnosis. In terms of the treatment, currently, there is neither a cure nor any way to slow the progression of AD. However, for people with mild or moderate stages of this disease, there are some medications available to temporarily reduce symptoms and help to improve quality of life. Hence, early diagnosis of AD is extremely crucial for overall better management of the disease. The researches have shown some relation between neuropsychological scores and atrophies of the brain. This can be leveraged for the early diagnosis of AD. This paper makes use of feature selection techniques to extract the most important features in the diagnosis of AD. This paper demonstrates the need to combine neuropsychological scores like mini-mental state examination (MMSE) with MRI features to provide better decisional space for early diagnosis of AD.

The structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) can be used to characterize the cortical atrophy that is closely coupled with clinical symptoms in AD and its prodromal stages. Many existing methods have focused on predicting the cognitive scores at future time-points using a set of morphological features derived from sMRI. The 3D sMRI can provide more massive information than the cognitive scores. However, very few works consider to predict an individual brain MRI image at future time-points. In this article, we propose a disease progression prediction framework that comprises a 3D multi-information generative adversarial network (mi-GAN) to predict what one's whole brain will look like with an interval, and a 3D DenseNet based multi-class classification network optimized with a focal loss to determine the clinical stage of the estimated brain. The mi-GAN can generate high-quality individual 3D brain MRI image conditioning on the individual 3D brain sMRI and multi-information at the baseline time-point. Experiments are implemented on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Our mi-GAN shows the state-of-the-art performance with the structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.943 between the real MRI images at the fourth year and the generated ones.

Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.","","978-1-5386-1399-3","10.1109/CIBCB.2018.8404980","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8404980","","Dementia;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Timing;Smoothing methods","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology","fMRI data;deep learning algorithm;significant memory concern;late cognitive mild impair;Alzheimer's disease;neurological disorder;brain patterns;convolutional neuronal network architecture;normal healthy control;AlexNet model;early mild cognitive impair","","3","","31","","9 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This disease is dangerous as the patient's average survival rate lies within eleven years; therefore, earlier diagnosis can save lives and improve the mortality rate. The precise cause of Alzheimer disease is still unknown; however, earlier diagnosis can control the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) into Alzheimer disease (AD). With time the condition worsens and no proper cure of disease found yet. The aim is to reduce the disease's growth, reduce the signs, address behaviour problems and improve the lifestyle. However, some short-lived treatments can reduce the risk of conversion into AD at an early stage. In this paper, a new deep learning technique is proposed; which predict and classify the disease more precisely by using structural MRI images. Convolutional neural network (CNN) were applied on slices of MRI images of ADNI dataset. CNN performance was evaluated, and it gives higher accuracy in classifying the AD, CN and MCI.

We demonstrate the impact of the data division strategy on the model performances by comparing the results derived from two different split approaches. We first evaluated the performance of the CNN models by dividing the dataset at the subject level in which all of the MRI slices of a patient are put into either training or test set. We then observed that pooling together all slices prior to applying cross-validation, as erroneously done in a number of previous studies, leads to inflated accuracies by as much as 26% for the classification of the diseases.","","978-1-7281-1867-3","10.1109/BIBM47256.2019.8983088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8983088","Parkinson's Disease;Alzheimer's Disease;Deep Learning;Transfer Learning;VGG16;Resnet50;MRI;Neuroimaging","","biomedical MRI;convolutional neural nets;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","deep learning models;neurodegenerative disease classification;machine learning;neuroimaging;medical data analysis;automated diagnostics;convolutional neural network models;Alzheimer's Disease;Parkinson's Disease;CNN models;MRI slices","","2","","53","","6 Feb 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Radiomic features obtained from brain MRI have shown a great potential as non-invasive biomarkers for this disease; however, their usefulness has not yet been explored for individual brain regions. In this paper, we hypothesize that distinct regions are affected differently by AD and, thus, that shape or texture changes occurring in separate regions can be expressed by different radiomic features. Moreover, to improve the classification of AD and healthy control (HC) subjects, we propose novel features based on the entropy of the convolution neural network (CNN) feature maps. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. Our experiments assess the significance of 45 different radiomic features from individual subcortical regions, via the Wilcoxon test. We also use the random forest classifier to identify the subcortical regions that best differentiate AD patients from HC subjects. Our analysis identified the features derived from several subcortical regions that show significant differences between AD and HC (corrected p <; 0.01). Specifically, we found correlation and volume features from the hippocampus (AUC = 81.19% - 84.09%) and amygdala (AUC = 79.70% - 80.27%) regions to have the greatest discriminative power. Furthermore, the proposed entropy features derived from CNN layers yielded the highest classification AUC of 92.58%, compared to 84.45% for the combined radiomic features of all subcortical.

To address this challenge, we propose a new MCI identification method based on multi-view graph convolutional networks (MVGCNs). Firstly, we extract multiple morphological features based on multi-atlas from the imaging data of each subject. Then, we construct multiple population graphs (PGs) based on all experimental subjects using morphological features and non-imaging data of each subject. Afterwards, to obtain more discriminant features for MCI identification, multi-view graph convolutional networks are proposed for PGs based on each atlas. Finally, a new ensemble learning method is proposed to perform MCI identification task. Our proposed method is evaluated on 1449 subjects (including 301 subjects with AD, 779 subjects with MCI and 369 subjects with cognitively normal (CN)) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves an accuracy of 90.8% for MCI/CN classification, and an accuracy of 88.6% for MCI/AD classification, respectively.

So, GSP has become a natural choice for many brain image analysis applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the early stages using fMRI data obtained from ADNI dataset. Firstly, we extract efficient discriminating features from resting state fMRI data using our novel hypothesis which is based on the outcomes of two neurological experiments carried out independently. Then we classify these graph signals by designing a classifier based on recently proposed graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). GCNN is the generalization of convolutional neural network (CNN) to the irregular domain using the concepts of GSP. We constructed brain graphs using different connectivity measures and compared the performance obtained using these graphs to find the best suitable connectivity measure for our application. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art AD detection methods with a classification accuracy of 92.44%. This improvement can be associated with the fact that we first extracted highly discriminating features using graph frequency analysis performed with suitably constructed graphs and then applied properly designed GCNN classifier to classify the input graph signals.","","978-1-7281-1929-8","10.1109/EECS.2018.00062","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8910066","Alzheimer's Disease, Graph Signal Processing, Graph Fourier Transform, Graph Convolutional Neural Network","Laplace equations;Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Convolution;Diseases","biomedical MRI;brain;convolutional neural nets;diseases;feature extraction;graph theory;image classification;medical image processing;neurophysiology","ADNI dataset;brain graph construction;graph convolutional neural network;fMRI data;brain image analysis applications;irregularly structured data;classical signal processing methods;neuroimaging data;graph signal processing;Alzheimer's disease detection;graph frequency analysis","","2","","29","","25 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current methods of predicting the progression of AD can delay treatment and lead to misdiagnosis. We propose a novel approach to simulate the rate of progression of AD and the atrophy of the brain over time. We seek to achieve this by generating synthetic magnetic resonance (MR) images via a series of Conditional Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Neural Networks (CDCGANs) and then analyze them by computing the fractal dimensionality of the cortical brain ribbons. This paper shows the feasibility of this proposal by cascading CDCGANs that simulate different stages of AD. It is possible to extend by a tandem of CDCGANs that would simulate the different stages of the disease. MR images used here are from ADNI(Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative).

Anatomical MRI has been widely used to assess structural brain atrophy for AD detection and prediction. In addition to structural changes, metabolic changes in some brain regions such as the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) could be a good bio-marker for an early AD detection. Recently, proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (1H-MRS) have been proved to be effective to reveal a wealth of brain metabolic information. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep leaning Network for early AD and Normal Control (NC) subjects classification using 1H-MRS raw data from the PCC area. This work is the first investigation of 1H - MRS data with deep-learning technique for early AD detection.

The automatic WMH segmentation methods exist, but a standardized comparison of the performance of such methods is lacking. We organized a scientific challenge, in which developers could evaluate their methods on a standardized multi-center/-scanner image dataset, giving an objective comparison: the WMH Segmentation Challenge. Sixty T1 + FLAIR images from three MR scanners were released with the manual WMH segmentations for training. A test set of 110 images from five MR scanners was used for evaluation. The segmentation methods had to be containerized and submitted to the challenge organizers. Five evaluation metrics were used to rank the methods: 1) Dice similarity coefficient; 2) modified Hausdorff distance (95th percentile); 3) absolute log-transformed volume difference; 4) sensitivity for detecting individual lesions; and 5) F1-score for individual lesions. In addition, the methods were ranked on their inter-scanner robustness; 20 participants submitted their methods for evaluation. This paper provides a detailed analysis of the results. In brief, there is a cluster of four methods that rank significantly better than the other methods, with one clear winner. The inter-scanner robustness ranking shows that not all the methods generalize to unseen scanners. The challenge remains open for future submissions and provides a public platform for method evaluation.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2019.2905770","ZonMw; MIAC AG, Basel, Switzerland; Hotchkiss Brain Institute; Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad; European Regional Development Fund; Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte; National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Ontario Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Development (OGS-M); National Natural Science Foundation of China; Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnología; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Education; Multiple Sclerosis Society; National Institutes of Health; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Alzheimer Society; Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad; European Regional Development Fund; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; NIHR UCLH Biomedical Research Centre; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669968","Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI);brain;evaluation and performance;segmentation","Image segmentation;Three-dimensional displays;Manuals;White matter;Biomedical imaging;Radiology","biomedical MRI;brain;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology","FLAIR images;MR scanners;lesion detection;inter-scanner robustness ranking;cerebral white matter hyperintensities;presumed vascular origin;neurological research studies;brain MR images;automatic WMH segmentation methods;Dice similarity coefficient;modified Hausdorff distance;absolute log-transformed volume difference","Aged;Algorithms;Female;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Middle Aged;White Matter","52","","69","","19 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study develops a new trilateral filter that aims to achieve robust and efficient image restoration. Methods: Extended from the bilateral filter, the proposed algorithm contains one additional intensity similarity funct-ion, which compensates for the unique characteristics of noise in brain MR images. An entropy function adaptive to intensity variations is introduced to regulate the contributions of the weighting components. To hasten the computation, parallel computing based on the graphics processing unit (GPU) strategy is explored with emphasis on memory allocations and thread distributions. To automate the filtration, image texture feature analysis associated with machine learning is investigated. Among the 98 candidate features, the sequential forward floating selection scheme is employed to acquire the optimal texture features for regularization. Subsequently, a two-stage classifier that consists of support vector machines and artificial neural networks is established to predict the filter parameters for automation. Results: A speedup gain of 757 was reached to process an entire MR image volume of 256 × 256 × 256 pixels, which completed within 0.5 s. Automatic restoration results revealed high accuracy with an ensemble average relative error of 0.53 ± 0.85% in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio. Conclusion: This self-regulating trilateral filter outperformed many state-of-the-art noise reduction methods both qualitatively and quantitatively. Significance: We believe that this new image restoration algorithm is of potential in many brain MR image processing applications that require expedition and automation.","1558-2531","","10.1109/TBME.2017.2772853","Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8105819","Automation;GPU;image restoration;MRI;neural networks;SVM;texture feature;trilateral filter","Image restoration;Filtering algorithms;Wiener filters;Signal to noise ratio;Filtering","biomedical MRI;brain;entropy;feature selection;graphics processing units;image classification;image denoising;image filtering;image restoration;image texture;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;parallel processing;support vector machines","brain MR image restoration;automatic trilateral filter;GPU-based acceleration;noise reduction;brain magnetic resonance images;intensity similarity function;entropy function;weighting components;parallel computing;graphics processing unit strategy;thread distributions;memory allocations;image texture feature analysis;machine learning;sequential forward floating selection scheme;two-stage classifier;support vector machines;artificial neural networks;MR image volume;peak signal-to-noise ratio;brain MR image processing applications","Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Humans;Image Processing, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Male;Signal-To-Noise Ratio","2","","65","","13 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Presently, to assess fundamental brain shifts in magneto resonance imaging (MRI), deep learning methods have been used. Because of its excellent performance in automatic features processing a convolution neural network has become popular with a variety of multilayer perceptrons.

We develop a deep learning-based joint filtering framework for simultaneously incorporating information from longer acquisition PET frames and high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images into the short frames. The network inputs are noisy PET images and corresponding MR images while the outputs are linear coefficients of spatially variant linear representation model. The composite of all dynamic frames is used as training label in each sample, and it is down-sampled to 1/10th of counts as the training input. L1-norm combined with two gradient-based regularizations constitute the loss function during training. Ten realistic dynamic PET/MR phantoms based on BrainWeb are used for pre-training and eleven clinical subjects from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative further for fine-tuning. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the statistical noise while preserving image details and achieve quantitative enhancements compared with Gaussian, guided filter, and convolutional neural network trained with the mean squared error. The clinical results perform better than others in terms of the mean activity and standard deviation.

This technology has been widely used to detect the neurodegenerative dementia and to reveal the intrinsic mechanism of neural activities. The BFCN edge was usually determined by the pairwise correlation between the brain regions. This study proposed a weighted voting model of multi-source connectivity networks (MuscNet) by integrating multiple BFCNs of different correlation coefficients. Our model was further improved by removing redundant features. The experimental data demonstrated that different BFCNs contributed complementary information to each other and MuscNet outperformed the existing models on detecting MCI patients. The previous study suggested the existence of multiple solutions with similarly good performance for a machine learning problem.

In addition to many numerical features, fMRI time series data also cover specific contextual knowledge and global fluctuation information. Here, we propose multi-scale time-series kernel-based learning model for brain disease diagnosis, based on Jensen-Shannon divergence. First, we calculate correlation value within and between brain regions over time. In addition, we extract multi-scale synergy expression probability distribution (interactional relation) between brain regions. Also, we produce state transition probability distribution (sequential relation) on single brain regions. Then, we build time-series kernel-based learning model based on Jensen-Shannon divergence to measure similarity of brain functional connectivity.

However, with limited datasets, it is challenging to train stable classifiers with such high-dimensional surface data. This necessitates a feature reduction that is commonly accomplished via regional volumetric morphometry from standard brain atlases. However, current regional summaries are not specific to the given age or pathology that is studied, which runs the risk of losing relevant information that can be critical in the classification process. To solve this issue, this paper proposes a novel data-driven approach by extending convolutional neural networks (CNN) for use on non-Euclidean manifolds such as cortical surfaces. The proposed network learns the most powerful features and brain regions from the extracted large dimensional feature space; thus creating a new feature space in which the dimensionality is reduced and feature distributions are better separated. We demonstrate the usability of the proposed surface-CNN framework in an example study classifying Alzheimers disease patients versus normal controls. The high performance in the cross-validation diagnostic results shows the potential of our proposed prediction system.","1945-8452","978-1-5386-3636-7","10.1109/ISBI.2018.8363631","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8363631","MRI;Cortical Surfaces;Alzheimer's Disease;Deep Learning;Convolutional Neural Network","Feature extraction;Kernel;Surface reconstruction;Surface treatment;Manifolds;Diseases;Level measurement","biomedical MRI;brain;convolution;diseases;feature extraction;feedforward neural nets;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","convolutional learning;cortical brain surfaces;multiple cortical features;surface vertex;neurodevelopmental diseases;neurodegenerative diseases;datasets;stable classifiers;high-dimensional surface data;feature reduction;regional volumetric morphometry;standard brain atlases;classification process;convolutional neural networks;nonEuclidean manifolds;cortical surfaces;brain regions;dimensionality;feature distributions;surface-CNN framework;Alzheimers disease patients;large dimensional feature space","","","","14","","24 May 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Brain connectivity network inferred from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data has been prevalently used to identify the individuals with MCI/AD from the normal controls. The capability to detect the causal or effective connectivity is highly desirable for understanding directed functional interactions between brain regions and further helping the detection of MCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel sparse constrained effective connectivity inference method and an elastic multilayer perceptron classifier for MCI identification. Specifically, a ultra-group constrained structure detection algorithm is first designed to identify the parsimonious topology of the effective connectivity network, in which the weak derivatives of the observable data are considered. Second, based on the identified topology structure, an effective connectivity network is then constructed by using an ultra-orthogonal forward regression algorithm to minimize the shrinking effect of the group constraint-based method. Finally, the effective connectivity network is validated in MCI identification using an elastic multilayer perceptron classifier, which extracts lower to higher level information from initial input features and hence improves the classification performance. Relatively high classification accuracy is achieved by the proposed method when compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods. Furthermore, the network analysis results demonstrate that MCI patients suffer a rich club effect loss and have decreased connectivity among several brain regions. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only improves the classification performance but also successfully discovers critical disease-related neuroimaging biomarkers.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2018.2882189","National Natural Science Foundation of China; Minjiang University; Natural Science Foundation of Beijing Municipality; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540933","Functional imaging;brain;computer-aided detection and diagnosis;connectivity analysis;machine learning","Feature extraction;Time series analysis;Functional magnetic resonance imaging;Diseases;Multilayer perceptrons;Classification algorithms;Data mining","biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;medical image processing;multilayer perceptrons;network theory (graphs);neurophysiology;object detection;pattern classification;regression analysis;sparse matrices","ultra-group constrained orthogonal forward regression;elastic multilayer perceptron classifier;MCI identification;mild cognitive impairment detection;brain connectivity network;functional magnetic resonance imaging data;ultra-group constrained structure detection algorithm;MCI patients;MCI-AD;Alzheimer's disease;sparse constrained effective connectivity inference method;parsimonious topology;neuroimaging biomarkers","Algorithms;Alzheimer Disease;Brain;Cognitive Dysfunction;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Neural Networks, Computer","3","","45","","20 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Studies use MRI from many medical imaging centers. However, individual centers typically use distinctive MRI protocols for brain scanning. The protocol differences include different scanner models with various operating parameters. Some scanner models have different field strengths. A key factor in classifying multicentric MR subject images having different protocols is how different scanner models affect the extraction of feature, and the subsequent classification performance of a supervised classifier. We have investigated the classification performance of FreeSurfer and MALF based volume features together with Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machine across different imaging protocols. We have also investigated for both FreeSurfer and MALF, which brain regions are most effective for the detection of the disease under different protocols.

Compared with region-wise analysis, our method does not rely on any pre-specified brain region map, but instead finds homogenous correlation regions adaptively given the data.

Emotion classifiers have historically used software on general-purpose computers and operating under off-line conditions. Yet the wearability of such classifiers is a must if they are to enable the socialization of critical-care patients. Such wearability requires the use of low-power hardware accelerators that would enable near real-time classification and extended periods of operations. In this article, we architect, design, implement, and test a handcrafted, hardware Convolutional Neural Network, named BioCNN, optimized for EEG-based emotion detection and other bio-medical applications. The EEG signals are generated using a low-cost, off-the-shelf device, namely, Emotiv Epoc+, and then denoised and pre-processed ahead of their use by BioCNN. For training and testing, BioCNN uses three repositories of emotion classification datasets, including the publicly available DEAP and DREAMER datasets, along with an original dataset collected in-house from 5 healthy subjects using standard visual stimuli. A subject-specific training approach is used under TensorFlow to train BioCNN, which is implemented using the Digilent Atlys Board with a low-cost Spartan-6 FPGA. The experimental results show a competitive energy efficiency of 11 GOps/W, a throughput of 1.65 GOps that is in line with the real-time specification of a wearable device, and a latency of less than 1 ms, which is smaller than the 150 ms required for human interaction times.

A major factor of brain induced electric field is the inter-subject variability, therefore a computer simulation is frequently used to simulate different TMS setups using anatomical models generated from MR images of the examined subject. Human head models are generated by segmentation of MR images into different anatomical tissues with a uniform electric conductivity value for each tissue. This process is time-consuming and requires a special experience to segment a relatively large number of tissues.In this paper, we propose a deep convolution network for human head segmentation that is convenient for simulation of electrical field distribution, such as TMS.

The recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such research. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and the requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where the state-of-the-art VGG architecture is initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with the training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach the state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned.

However, a common bottleneck of the diagnostic performance is overfitting due to having lot of irrelevant features in the training data. In view of this fact, we propose a novel classification framework which uses unsupervised autoencoder network to select the subset from given structural and clinical features by exploring the linear and nonlinear relationship among them followed by a supervised multinomial logistic layer to automatically identify the patients having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status.

As it is practically challenging to capture local and subtle disease-associated abnormalities directly from the whole-brain sMRI, most of those deep-learning approaches empirically preselect disease-associated sMRI brain regions for model construction. Considering that such isolated selection of potentially informative brain locations might be suboptimal, very few methods have been proposed to perform disease-associated discriminative region localization and disease diagnosis in a unified deep-learning framework. However, those methods based on task-oriented discriminative localization still suffer from two common limitations, that is: 1) identified brain locations are strictly consistent across all subjects, which ignores the unique anatomical characteristics of each brain and 2) only limited local regions/patches are used for model training, which does not fully utilize the global structural information provided by the whole-brain sMRI. In this article, we propose an attention-guided deep-learning framework to extract multilevel discriminative sMRI features for dementia diagnosis. Specifically, we first design a backbone fully convolutional network to automatically localize the discriminative brain regions in a weakly supervised manner. Using the identified disease-related regions as spatial attention guidance, we further develop a hybrid network to jointly learn and fuse multilevel sMRI features for CAD model construction. Our proposed method was evaluated on three public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and AIBL), showing superior performance compared with several state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of AD diagnosis and MCI conversion prediction.","2168-2275","","10.1109/TCYB.2020.3005859","NIH; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9151307","Alzheimer's disease (AD);convolutional neural networks (CNNs);multilevel feature learning;structural MRI;weakly supervised localization","Feature extraction;Brain modeling;Task analysis;Dementia;Solid modeling;Medical diagnosis","","","","","","","","28 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Instead of a recurrent model which poses computational/technical issues, and inspired by recent results showing the viability of dilated convolutional models for sequence prediction, we develop a dilated convolutional neural network architecture for this task. On the technical side, we show how the modules needed in our network can be derived while explicitly taking the Riemannian manifold structure into account.

Four global metrics, network resilience, connection-level metrics and node versatility were used to distinguish between controls and patients. The results show that the main frequency bands that are different between MCI patients and controls are the θ and low α bands, and the differently affected brain areas are the frontal, left temporal and parietal areas. Compared to MCI patients, in patients with mild AD, the main frequency bands that are different are the low and high α bands, and the main differently affected brain region is a larger right temporal area. Four LOFC bands were used as input to train the ResNet-18 model. For the MCI dataset, the average accuracy of 20 runs was 93.42% and the best accuracy was 98.33%, while for the mild AD dataset, the average accuracy was 98.54% and the best accuracy was 100%. To determine the timing of early treatment and discovering the susceptible patients, and to slow the progression of the disease, we assume that the occurrence of MCI and mild AD and their progression to more serious AD and dementia could be inferred by analyzing the topological structure of the brain network generated by EEG.

Moreover, the introduction of a supervised component into the generative process can constrain the model for more discriminative characterization. In this study, we propose an original method based on supervised topic modeling to characterize AD from a generative perspective, yet maintaining discriminative power at differentiating disease populations. Our topic modeling jointly exploits discretized image features and categorical genetic features. Diagnostic information - cognitively normal (CN), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD - is introduced as a supervision variable.

Therefore, being able to detect and treat the disease while it is in mild cognitive impairment is essential for effective prevention of Alzheimer's disease. Many scholars have proposed a variety of different AI diagnostic models for Alzheimer's disease. These models are mainly trained based on MRI image data. However, in addition to MRI images, clinical diagnosis data of Alzheimer's disease also includes data of multiple modalities such as MRI text reports and test results of mental and psychological scales. Moreover, in the actual clinical data, there are fewer samples of Alzheimer's disease data and lack of sufficient training samples. This paper proposes a classification and diagnosis method for Alzheimer's patients based on multi-modal feature fusion and small sample learning. Specifically, we use structured MRI image reports and corresponding MRI images as multi-modal input, and then the compressed interactive network is used to explicitly fuse the extracted features at the vector level; finally, the KNN attention pooling layer and the convolutional network are used to construct a small sample learning network to classify the patient diagnosis data. The experimental results show that the accuracy and Fl-score value based on multi-modality are improved by more than 10% compared with single-modality. Using the small sample learning method under the same multimodal data, the accuracy rate increased by 8.2%, and the Fl-score value increased by 8.4%.","","978-1-7281-8571-2","10.1109/ICPHDS51617.2020.00060","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9361894","Alzheimer’s disease;multimodal;feature fusion;few-shot learning","Training;Magnetic resonance imaging;Psychology;Feature extraction;Data mining;Public healthcare;Diseases","biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);medical diagnostic computing;medical image processing;patient diagnosis;patient treatment","mild cognitive impairment;MRI image data;Alzheimer's disease data;Alzheimer's patients","","","","15","","26 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p <; 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and theta bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, theta, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome.

With the construction of functional network of AD subjects, the topological features of weighted and unweighted networks are extracted. Taken the network parameters as independent inputs, a fuzzy-system-based TSK model is established and further trained to identify AD EEG signals. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme in AD identification and ability of N-TSK fuzzy classifiers. The highest accuracy can achieve 97.3% for patients with closed eyes and 94.78% with open eyes. In addition, the performance of weighted N-TSK largely exceeds unweighted N-TSK. By further optimizing the network features utilized in the N-TSK fuzzy classifiers, it is found that local efficiency and clustering coefficient are the most effective factors in AD identification.

Specifically, the proposed ML system consists of evaluating the average Time-Frequency Map (aTFM) related to a 19-channels EEG epoch and extracting some statistical coefficients (i.e. mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis and entropy) from the main five conventional EEG sub-bands (or EEG-rhythms: delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, beta).

The diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance (MR) images and the advances in computer-aided tractography algorithms let us know strong association between human brain networks and cognitive functions. Brain regions dedicated to a certain specific cognitive function were spatially clustered and efficiently connected each other; it is called local functional segregation. However, it is not well known that such a local segregation is associated with a certain sub-network which may act as a building block of the brain network. In this work, using a graph auto-encoder, we extracted building blocks of brain networks and investigate whether they are affected by a neurological disease, Alzheimer's disease. We found that the brain network of each person is linear summation of the learned building blocks. Also, the activation levels of these building blocks vary in the normal controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease, showing that network deterioration in the disease group.","","978-1-5386-7822-0","10.1109/ICAIIC.2019.8669055","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8669055","brain networks;graph auto-encoder;graph convolutional neural network;Alzheimer’s disease","Diseases;Matrix decomposition;Deep learning;Decoding;Hospitals;Encoding;Data models","biodiffusion;biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology","brain regions;human brain networks;building block extraction;local segregation;cognitive functions;diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance inages;MRI;graph auto-encoder;spacial clusters;Alzheimer's disease;neurological disease;activation levels;computer-aided tractography algorithms","","1","","24","","21 Mar 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A large number of deep learning models have been developed, such as alexnet, VGg net, Gan and so on. The common limitation of these models is that they rely on a large number of labeled training images and need deeper network structure to achieve higher accuracy. It is challenging to obtain a large number of labeled data in the field of medical image. Training a suitable medical image classification model from scratch also requires a lot of resources. To solve these problems, in this paper, we try to use convolutional network (CNN) transfer learning for image classification training, select CNN network model, fine tune the network weight layer by layer, modify the last layer of CNN for training on MRI image. In order to reduce the size of training data, we use image entropy to select the most informative slice. Through the experiments on ADNI data sets, compared with other contemporary methods, we achieve 99.89% on the classification of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Normal Cognitive (NC) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Attractively, class activation mapping (CAM) is employed to visualize brain regions related to AD, which further gives the targeted information for AD diagnosis.","","978-1-6654-1540-8","10.1109/ICBAIE52039.2021.9389992","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389992","Alzheimer’s-disease;CAM;Medical image classification","Training;Magnetic resonance imaging;Transfer learning;Training data;Medical diagnostic imaging;Image classification;Diseases","","","","","","17","","2 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

AD causes neuronal damage in the Brain Internal Regions (BIR) specifically Corpus Callosum (CC), White Matter (WM), Grey Matter (GM), Hippocampus (HC) and ventricle. The neuronal loss makes the changes in anatomical structure of the brain which affects the BIR. Identification of structural difference between the normal controls (NC) and AD of the brain is a challenging process due to its complex networks of nerves. Hence, there is a requirement of segmentation process to extract the BIR. The proposed work focused to segment the CC and ventricle regions using multi-level thresholding methods namely Ant colony Optimization (ACO) and Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) optimization techniques. These methods have been analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively using various measures with ground truth (GT) images. Artificial Bee Colony optimization techniques have been achieved the better accuracy of 93 % than ACO. Deep Learning (DL) classifier has been used to classify normal controls (NC) and AD and acquired the better accuracy of 78% in ABC than ACO.

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an advanced imaging technique, is capable of producing high quality images of the human body including the brain for diagnosis purposes. This paper proposes a simple but efficient solution for the classification of MRI brain images into normal, and abnormal images containing disorders and injuries. It uses images with brain tumor, acute stroke and alzheimer, besides normal images, from the public dataset developed by harvard medical school, for evaluation purposes. The proposed model is a four step process, in which the steps are named: 1). Pre-processing, 2). Features Extraction, 3). Features Reduction, and 4). Classification. Median filter, being one of the best algorithms, is used for the removal of noise such as salt and pepper, and unwanted components such as scalp and skull, in the pre-processing step. During this stage, the images are converted from gray scale to colored images for further processing. In second step, it uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique to extract different features from the images. In third stage, Color Moments (CMs) are used to reduce the number of features and get an optimal set of characteristics. Images with the optimal set of features are passed to different classifiers for the classification of images.

For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging patients (BA ≉ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer’s patients with different dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer’s patients. A statistical and visualization-based analysis has provided evidence regarding the potential and current challenges of the proposed methodology.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2021.3066857","Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9380560","Biological age estimation;deep learning;chronological age;magnetic resonance imaging","Estimation;Aging;Biological systems;Magnetic resonance imaging;Biomedical imaging;Three-dimensional displays;Genetics","","","","","","","IEEE","17 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Large longitudinal MRI datasets have revealed such deterioration, in part, by applying machine and deep learning to predict diagnosis. A popular approach is to apply Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract informative features from each visit of the longitudinal MRI and then use those features to classify each visit via Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Such modeling neglects the progressive nature of the disease, which may result in clinically implausible classifications across visits. To avoid this issue, we propose to combine features across visits by coupling feature extraction with a novel longitudinal pooling layer and enforce consistency of the classification across visits in line with disease progression. We evaluate the proposed method on the longitudinal structural MRIs from three neuroimaging datasets: Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI, N=404), a dataset composed of 274 normal controls and 329 patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD), and 255 youths from the National Consortium on Alcohol and NeuroDevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA).

Patch-based multi-atlas segmentation (PBMAS) approach is a popular method for hippocampus segmentation and has achieved a promising result. However, the PBMAS approach needs high computation cost due to registration and the segmentation accuracy is subject to the registration accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on iterative local linear mapping (ILLM) with the representative and local structure-preserved feature embedding to achieve accurate and robust hippocampus segmentation with no need for registration. In the proposed approach, semi-supervised deep autoencoder (SSDA) exploits unsupervised deep autoencoder and local structure-preserved manifold regularization to nonlinearly transform the extracted magnetic resonance (MR) patch to embedded feature manifold, whose adjacent relationship is similar to the signed distance map (SDM) patch manifold. Local linear mapping is used to preliminarily predict SDM patch corresponding to the MR patch. Subsequently, threshold segmentation generates a preliminary segmentation.

The success of these approaches is mostly attributed to the application of machine learning techniques for neuroimaging. In this review paper, we present a comprehensive survey of automated diagnostic approaches for dementia using medical image analysis and machine learning algorithms published in the recent years. Based on the rigorous review of the existing works, we have found that, while most of the studies focused on Alzheimer's disease, recent research has demonstrated reasonable performance in the identification of other types of dementia remains a major challenge.

This trend leads on exploring and designing new machine learning techniques towards multi-modality medical and health dataset for predicting occurrences and modeling progression of AD. This paper aims at giving a systemic survey on summarizing and comparing several mainstream techniques for AD progression modeling, and discuss the potential and limitations of these techniques in practical applications. We summarize three key techniques for modeling AD progression: multi-task model, time series model and deep learning.

Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.","1558-254X","","10.1109/TMI.2020.2964499","British Heart Foundation; Academy of Medical Sciences; National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre based at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust and Imperial College London; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8950467","Shape analysis;explainable deep learning;generative modeling;MRI","Shape;Pathology;Three-dimensional displays;Task analysis;Deep learning;Medical diagnostic imaging","biomedical MRI;brain;cardiology;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","anatomical shape changes;scalar global indexes;segmentation space;left ventricles;multicentre dataset;hippocampi;Alzheimer's disease;ADNI data;volumetric imaging;deep hierarchical generative models;explainable anatomical shape analysis;large-scale studies;regional anatomical features;global anatomical features;unseen segmentations;classification task;generative properties;discriminative latent space;anatomical variability;classification space;direct visualisation;clinical conditions;two-dimensional latent space;conditional latent variables;anatomical segmentations;deep generative networks;interpretable deep learning model;decision processes;feature extraction;medical image analysis;pathology-driven anatomical remodeling;asymmetric modifications;regional modifications","","","","38","IEEE","6 Jan 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Alzheimer's disease pathologies have different density distributions in grey matter (GM) and white matter (WM), making the task of separating GM and WM necessary to neuropathologic deep phenotyping. Standard methods of segmentation typically require manual annotations, where a trained observer traces the boundaries of GM and WM on digitized tissue slide images using software like Aperio ImageScope or QuPath. This method can be time-consuming and can prevent the analysis of large amounts of slides in a scalable way. In this paper, we propose a CNN-based approach to automatically segment GM and WM in ultra-high-resolution whole slide images (WSIs) by transforming the segmentation problem into a classification problem. Contrary to the traditional image processing segmentation method, our technique is flexible, robust, and efficient with the accuracy of 77.43% in GM and 79.42% in WM on our hold-out WSIs.","","978-1-7281-1485-9","10.1109/ICMEW46912.2020.9105974","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9105974","Neuropathology;Image Segmentation;Convolutional Neural Networks;Ultra-high Resolution","Image segmentation;Training;Image resolution;Alzheimer's disease;Computer architecture;Pipelines","biochemistry;biological tissues;biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;image processing;image segmentation;medical image processing;neurophysiology;paediatrics;pattern recognition;statistical analysis","white matter segmentation;digitized Aβ human brain tissue slide images;vast brain areas;subtly differentiated morphologies;alzheimer;different density distributions;WM necessary;neuropathologic deep phenotyping;manual annotations;trained observer;digitized tissue slide images;segment GM;segmentation problem;traditional image processing segmentation method","","","","29","","9 Jun 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Medical images form an indispensable part of a patient's health record which can be applied to control, handle and treat the diseases. But, classification of images is a challenging task in computer-based diagnostics. In this research article, we have introduced a improved classifier i.e., Optimal Deep Learning (DL) for classification of lung cancer, brain image, and Alzheimer's disease. The researchers proposed the Optimal Feature Selection based Medical Image Classification using DL model by incorporating preprocessing, feature selection and classification. The main goal of the paper is to derive an optimal feature selection model for effective medical image classification. To enhance the performance of the DL classifier, Opposition-based Crow Search (OCS) algorithm is proposed. The OCS algorithm picks the optimal features from pre-processed images, here Multi-texture, grey level features were selected for the analysis. Finally, the optimal features improved the classification result and increased the accuracy, specificity and sensitivity in the diagnosis of medical images. The proposed results were implemented in MATLAB and compared with existing feature selection models and other classification approaches.

Our theoretical analysis shows that the proposed aggregated cost of cycles (ACC) is monotonically increasing and thus we define a univariate persistent feature based on the shape of ACC. The proposed statistic has advantages compared to the First Betti Number Plot (BNP1), which only tracks the total number of cycles at each filtration.

To provide such inductive biases, tensor layers have been successfully proposed to leverage multi-linear structure through higher-order computations. In this paper, we propose tensor dropout, a randomization technique that can be applied to tensor factorizations, such as those parametrizing tensor layers. In particular, we study tensor regression layers, parametrized by low-rank weight tensors and augmented with our proposed tensor dropout. We empirically show that our approach improves generalization for image classification on ImageNet and CIFAR-100. We also establish state-of-the-art accuracy for phenotypic trait prediction on the largest available dataset of brain MRI (U.K. Biobank), where multi-linear structure is paramount. In all cases, we demonstrate superior performance and significantly improved robustness, both to noisy inputs and to adversarial attacks. We establish the theoretical validity of our approach and the regularizing effect of tensor dropout by demonstrating the link between randomized tensor regression with tensor dropout and deterministic regularized tensor regression.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2021.3064182","Edmond J Safra Foundation and Lily Safra; NIHR Senior Investigator's Award; UK Dementia Research Institute; UK DRI Ltd; Medical Research Council; Alzheimer's Society and Alzheimer's Research UK; Imperial College NIHR Biomedical Research Centre; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9381098","Deep learning;randomized tensor regression;robustness;stochastic regularization;tensor dropout;tensor methods;tensor regression;tensor regression layers","Tensors;Training;Robustness;Magnetic resonance imaging;Perturbation methods;Diseases;Deep learning","","","","","","63","IEEE","18 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Having 88 registrants (roughly 20% medical, non-IEEE, and the rest primarily IEEE engineering professionals) from 10 countries, the BDBC-Finale program consisted of presentations from 5 selected teams resulting from 3 preliminary runs earlier in 2020. The program was further enriched with a National Institute of Aging (NIA) Keynote on US funding sources and a Special Panel on Codesigning with an End-User, Prof. Justin Yerbury, who has been suffering from motor neuron disease since 2016. The theme for 2020 was the Aging Brain, making use of large brain records, (1) Alzheimer’'s Disease NeuroImaging (ADNI) containing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography, CerebroSpinal Fluid images, and clinical data (~3 TB), and (2) ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG) corpus (48–350 GB) to examine brain degeneration ending in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Individual teams specified selected brain datasets to apply deep learning/machine learning techniques for the detection of elderly brain impairment. Other approaches to understand AD were also presented in terms of fMRI-based functional connectivity alteration, and experiments in rehabilitation using turmeric administered rats after bulbectomy. The author discuses the gains from these BDB Challenge presentations.","2162-2256","","10.1109/MCE.2021.3051928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9324935","","","","","","","","0","IEEE","14 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Magazines"
