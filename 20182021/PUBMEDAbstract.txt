Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the 
most common cause of dementia. Beta-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and neurofibrillary 
tangles (NFTs) of abnormal hyperphosphorylated tau protein are the pathological 
hallmarks of the disease, accompanied by other pathological processes such as 
microglia activation. Functional and molecular nuclear medicine imaging with 
single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission 
tomography (PET) techniques provides valuable information about the underlying 
pathological processes, many years before the appearance of clinical symptoms. 
Nuclear neuroimaging in AD has made great progress in the past two decades and 
has extended beyond the traditional role of brain perfusion and glucose 
metabolism evaluation. Intense efforts in radiopharmaceuticals research have led 
to the development of various probes able to detect Aβ deposits, tau protein 
accumulation, microglia activation and neuroinflammation. As a result, SPECT and 
PET have proposed to serve as biomarkers in recently revised diagnostic clinical 
criteria for the early diagnosis of AD and the prediction of progression to AD 
in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To explore the most recent developments in the effective 
diagnosis and treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
RECENT FINDINGS: The clinical diagnosis of NPS in AD is facilitated by the use 
of the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI). CT and MRI scans can be useful for 
detecting structural changes indicating AD. Other promising diagnostic 
methodologies that are less frequently used in the clinical setting include 
positron emission tomography (PET) scans for detecting amyloid and blood tests 
for detecting serum biomarkers. Numerous pharmaceutical agents have been studied 
for their use in managing NPS, with antipsychotics being popular for managing 
agitation but also having significant side effects. Non-pharmacological 
interventions, such as reminiscence therapy and the Describe, Investigate, 
Create, Evaluate (DICE) approach may be able to provide treatment without such 
adverse effects. Diagnosing AD and the comorbid NPS remains primarily a clinical 
endeavor with CT and MRI scans sometimes used, but evidence is amassing for the 
use of other imaging modalities and different lab tests for convenient and 
empiric diagnosis of AD to distinguish it from other psychiatric illnesses. The 
number of pharmacologic treatments for NPS that are safe as well as efficacious 
remains limited, yet non-pharmacologic interventions have clear clinical 
utility. In addition to searching for more successful pharmacological 
treatments, further research should focus on novel diagnostic tests and 
non-pharmacologic therapies.

Deep learning, a state-of-the-art machine learning approach, has shown 
outstanding performance over traditional machine learning in identifying 
intricate structures in complex high-dimensional data, especially in the domain 
of computer vision. The application of deep learning to early detection and 
automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained 
considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has 
generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of 
publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic 
classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used 
to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 
2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and 
neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full 
inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional 
machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The 
combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked 
auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for 
AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such 
as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that 
use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded 
accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion 
prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal 
neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches 
continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic 
classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses 
deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating 
additional hybrid data types, such as-omics data, increasing transparency with 
explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features 
and mechanisms.

Purpose To develop and validate a deep learning algorithm that predicts the 
final diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, or neither 
at fluorine 18 (18F) fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET of the brain and compare its 
performance to that of radiologic readers. Materials and Methods Prospective 
18F-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective 
independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were 
collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional 
neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set 
and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with 
performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, 
specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and 
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results The algorithm achieved area 
under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated 
on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set 
(82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the 
final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four 
of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P < .05). Saliency map 
demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire 
brain. Conclusion By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a 
deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease 
achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to 
the final diagnosis. © RSNA, 2018 Online supplemental material is available for

OBJECTIVE: To determine the rate of tau accumulation in healthy older adults 
(OA) and patients with Alzheimer disease (AD), as well as the relationship of 
tau accumulation to cortical atrophy.
METHODS: Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 
Pittsburg compound B [PiB]+ , age = 77.6 ± 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) 
and 19 PiB+ patients with AD (age = 63.1 ± 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 
years of follow-up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and 
cross-modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual 
percentage change in FTP was also calculated.
RESULTS: Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and 
medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and 
included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. 
In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial 
cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations 
between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or APOE. Regional FTP 
significantly increased at follow-up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects 
models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences 
within OA based on PiB status.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in 
amyloid-negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo 
tau-PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, 
tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are 
not yet undergoing significant atrophy. Ann Neurol 2019; 1-12 ANN NEUROL

We built and validated a deep learning algorithm predicting the individual 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment who will 
convert to AD (c-MCI) based on a single cross-sectional brain structural MRI 
scan. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were applied on 3D T1-weighted images 
from ADNI and subjects recruited at our Institute (407 healthy controls [HC], 
418 AD, 280 c-MCI, 533 stable MCI [s-MCI]). CNN performance was tested in 
distinguishing AD, c-MCI and s-MCI. High levels of accuracy were achieved in all 
the classifications, with the highest rates achieved in the AD vs HC 
classification tests using both the ADNI dataset only (99%) and the combined 
ADNI + non-ADNI dataset (98%). CNNs discriminated c-MCI from s-MCI patients with 
an accuracy up to 75% and no difference between ADNI and non-ADNI images. CNNs 
provide a powerful tool for the automatic individual patient diagnosis along the 
AD continuum. Our method performed well without any prior feature engineering 
and regardless the variability of imaging protocols and scanners, demonstrating 
that it is exploitable by not-trained operators and likely to be generalizable 
to unseen patient data. CNNs may accelerate the adoption of structural MRI in 
routine practice to help assessment and management of patients.

Alzheimer's disease is the primary cause of dementia worldwide, with an 
increasing morbidity burden that may outstrip diagnosis and management capacity 
as the population ages. Current methods integrate patient history, 
neuropsychological testing and MRI to identify likely cases, yet effective 
practices remain variably applied and lacking in sensitivity and specificity. 
Here we report an interpretable deep learning strategy that delineates unique 
Alzheimer's disease signatures from multimodal inputs of MRI, age, gender, and 
Mini-Mental State Examination score. Our framework linked a fully convolutional 
network, which constructs high resolution maps of disease probability from local 
brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and generates precise, intuitive 
visualization of individual Alzheimer's disease risk en route to accurate 
diagnosis. The model was trained using clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease 
and cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 417) and validated on three independent cohorts: 
the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) 
(n = 382), the Framingham Heart Study (n = 102), and the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center (NACC) (n = 582). Performance of the model that used the 
multimodal inputs was consistent across datasets, with mean area under curve 
values of 0.996, 0.974, 0.876 and 0.954 for the ADNI study, AIBL, Framingham 
Heart Study and NACC datasets, respectively. Moreover, our approach exceeded the 
diagnostic performance of a multi-institutional team of practicing neurologists 
(n = 11), and high-risk cerebral regions predicted by the model closely tracked 
post-mortem histopathological findings. This framework provides a clinically 
adaptable strategy for using routinely available imaging techniques such as MRI 
to generate nuanced neuroimaging signatures for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, 
as well as a generalizable approach for linking deep learning to 
pathophysiological processes in human disease.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether midlife atherosclerosis is associated with 
different dementia subtypes and related underlying pathologies.
METHODS: Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish 
prospective population-based Malmö Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid 
plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991-1994). 
Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses 
were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired 
subcohort (n = 330), β-amyloid42 and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid 
(CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral 
microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009-2015).
RESULTS: During 20 years of follow-up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean 
age at baseline = 57.5 ± 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was 
associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause dementia (adjusted 
HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.26]) and vascular dementia 
(adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10-1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) 
dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77-1.17]). Carotid plaques were 
associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3-graded score (adjusted HR 
= 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07-3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort 
(53.8 ± 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated 
with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% 
CI = 1.05-2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted 
OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87-1.90] for Aβ42 and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86-2.13] for Aβ42 
/p-tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the 
underlying brain pathologies.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings support an association between midlife 
atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel 
disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD 
pathology. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:52-62.

Electrophysiology provides a real-time readout of neural functions and network 
capability in different brain states, on temporal (fractions of milliseconds) 
and spatial (micro, meso, and macro) scales unmet by other methodologies. 
However, current international guidelines do not endorse the use of 
electroencephalographic (EEG)/magnetoencephalographic (MEG) biomarkers in 
clinical trials performed in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), despite a 
surge in recent validated evidence. This position paper of the ISTAART 
Electrophysiology Professional Interest Area endorses consolidated and 
translational electrophysiological techniques applied to both experimental 
animal models of AD and patients, to probe the effects of AD neuropathology 
(i.e., brain amyloidosis, tauopathy, and neurodegeneration) on 
neurophysiological mechanisms underpinning neural excitation/inhibition and 
neurotransmission as well as brain network dynamics, synchronization, and 
functional connectivity, reflecting thalamocortical and corticocortical residual 
capacity. Converging evidence shows relationships between abnormalities in 
EEG/MEG markers and cognitive deficits in groups of AD patients at different 
disease stages. The supporting evidence for the application of electrophysiology 
in AD clinical research as well as drug discovery pathways warrants an 
international initiative to include the use of EEG/MEG biomarkers in the main 
multicentric projects planned in AD patients, to produce conclusive findings 
challenging the present regulatory requirements and guidelines for AD studies.

Brain functional imaging data, especially functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) data, have been employed to reflect functional integration of the brain. 
Alteration in brain functional connectivity (FC) is expected to provide 
potential biomarkers for classifying or predicting brain disorders. In this 
paper, we present a comprehensive review in order to provide guidance about the 
available brain FC measures and typical classification strategies. We survey the 
state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static functional 
connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic functional connectivity 
(DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of interest (ROIs), data-driven 
spatial network and functional network connectivity (FNC) are often computed to 
reflect SFC from different angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a 
sliding-window framework, and intrinsic connectivity states along the 
time-varying connectivity patterns are typically extracted using clustering or 
decomposition approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches. 
Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection including 
the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model building, we include 
traditional classifiers as well as more recently applied deep learning methods. 
Moreover, we review representative applications with remarkable classification 
accuracy for psychosis and mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and 
neurological disorders using fMRI data. Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 
Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are discussed. Finally, 
challenges in the field are pointed out with respect to the inaccurate diagnosis 
labeling, the abundant number of possible features and the difficulty in 
validation. Some suggestions for future work are also provided.

The Precision Neurology development process implements systems theory with 
system biology and neurophysiology in a parallel, bidirectional research path: a 
combined hypothesis-driven investigation of systems dysfunction within distinct 
molecular, cellular, and large-scale neural network systems in both animal 
models as well as through tests for the usefulness of these candidate dynamic 
systems biomarkers in different diseases and subgroups at different stages of 
pathophysiological progression. This translational research path is paralleled 
by an "omics"-based, hypothesis-free, exploratory research pathway, which will 
collect multimodal data from progressing asymptomatic, preclinical, and clinical 
neurodegenerative disease (ND) populations, within the wide continuous 
biological and clinical spectrum of ND, applying high-throughput and 
high-content technologies combined with powerful computational and statistical 
modeling tools, aimed at identifying novel dysfunctional systems and predictive 
marker signatures associated with ND. The goals are to identify common 
biological denominators or differentiating classifiers across the continuum of 
ND during detectable stages of pathophysiological progression, characterize 
systems-based intermediate endophenotypes, validate multi-modal novel diagnostic 
systems biomarkers, and advance clinical intervention trial designs by utilizing 
systems-based intermediate endophenotypes and candidate surrogate markers. 
Achieving these goals is key to the ultimate development of early and effective 
individualized treatment of ND, such as Alzheimer's disease. The Alzheimer 
Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) and cohort program (APMI-CP), as well as 
the Paris based core of the Sorbonne University Clinical Research Group 
"Alzheimer Precision Medicine" (GRC-APM) were recently launched to facilitate 
the passageway from conventional clinical diagnostic and drug development toward 
breakthrough innovation based on the investigation of the comprehensive 
biological nature of aging individuals. The APMI movement is gaining momentum to 
systematically apply both systems neurophysiology and systems biology in 
exploratory translational neuroscience research on ND.

Some forms of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) are the clinical precursors of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), while other MCI types tend to remain stable over-time 
and do not progress to AD. To identify and choose effective and personalized 
strategies to prevent or slow the progression of AD, we need to develop 
objective measures that are able to discriminate the MCI patients who are at 
risk of AD from those MCI patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we 
present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc 
layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who 
have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. Our deep learning 
procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, 
neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data as input measures. The most novel 
characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are the 
following: 1) our deep learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it 
jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD 
vs. healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature 
extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs 
fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which significantly 
limits data-overfitting (we use ∼550,000 network parameters, which is orders of 
magnitude lower than other network designs); 3) both structural MRI images and 
their warp field characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in 
relation to the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as 
much information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed on a 
subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192 AD patients, 
n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who convert to AD and MCI 
patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184 healthy controls). The most 
predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images and the 
demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast, the warp field 
metrics were of little added predictive value. The algorithm was able to 
distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within 3 years from those patients 
with stable MCI over the same time-period with an area under the curve (AUC) of 
0.925 and a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5%, and 
specificity of 85%. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved 
so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% 
accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying patients with AD from 
healthy controls. Our classification framework was also robust to the use of 
different co-registration templates and potentially irrelevant features/image 
portions. Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging 
modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The 
convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and 
gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the 
prediction of several medical conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders via 
multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.

Coding variants in the triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (TREM2) 
are associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). We demonstrate that 
amyloid plaque seeding is increased in the absence of functional Trem2. 
Increased seeding is accompanied by decreased microglial clustering around newly 
seeded plaques and reduced plaque-associated apolipoprotein E (ApoE). Reduced 
ApoE deposition in plaques is also observed in brains of AD patients carrying 
TREM2 coding variants. Proteomic analyses and microglia depletion experiments 
revealed microglia as one origin of plaque-associated ApoE. Longitudinal amyloid 
small animal positron emission tomography demonstrates accelerated 
amyloidogenesis in Trem2 loss-of-function mutants at early stages, which 
progressed at a lower rate with aging. These findings suggest that in the 
absence of functional Trem2, early amyloidogenesis is accelerated due to reduced 
phagocytic clearance of amyloid seeds despite reduced plaque-associated ApoE.

Machine learning algorithms are currently being implemented in an escalating 
manner to classify and/or predict the onset of some neurodegenerative diseases; 
including Alzheimer's Disease (AD); this could be attributed to the fact of the 
abundance of data and powerful computers. The objective of this work was to 
deliver a robust classification system for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) against healthy controls (HC) in a low-cost network in terms of shallow 
architecture and processing. In this study, the dataset included was downloaded 
from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The classification 
methodology implemented was the convolutional neural network (CNN), where the 
diffusion maps, and gray-matter (GM) volumes were the input images. The number 
of scans included was 185, 106, and 115 for HC, MCI and AD respectively. 
Ten-fold cross-validation scheme was adopted and the stacked mean diffusivity 
(MD) and GM volume produced an AUC of 0.94 and 0.84, an accuracy of 93.5% and 
79.6%, a sensitivity of 92.5% and 62.7%, and a specificity of 93.9% and 89% for 
AD/HC and MCI/HC classification respectively. This work elucidates the impact of 
incorporating data from different imaging modalities; i.e. structural Magnetic 
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), where deep learning 
was employed for the aim of classification. To the best of our knowledge, this 
is the first study assessing the impact of having more than one scan per subject 
and propose the proper maneuver to confirm the robustness of the system. The 
results were competitive among the existing literature, which paves the way for 
improving medications that could slow down the progress of the AD or prevent it.

Deep learning has recently been used for the analysis of neuroimages, such as 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI, and positron 
emission tomography (PET), and it has achieved significant performance 
improvements over traditional machine learning in computer-aided diagnosis of 
brain disorders. This paper reviews the applications of deep learning methods 
for neuroimaging-based brain disorder analysis. We first provide a comprehensive 
overview of deep learning techniques and popular network architectures by 
introducing various types of deep neural networks and recent developments. We 
then review deep learning methods for computer-aided analysis of four typical 
brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism 
spectrum disorder, and Schizophrenia, where the first two diseases are 
neurodegenerative disorders and the last two are neurodevelopmental and 
psychiatric disorders, respectively. More importantly, we discuss the 
limitations of existing studies and present possible future directions.

OBJECTIVES: Amyloid-beta (Aβ) and tau pathologies are commonly observed among 
clinically normal older individuals at postmortem and can now be detected with 
in vivo neuroimaging. The association and interaction of these proteinopathies 
with prospective cognitive decline in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) remains to be fully elucidated.
METHODS: One hundred thirty-seven older individuals (age = 76.3 ± 6.22 years) 
participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent Aβ (11 C-Pittsburgh 
compound B) and tau (18 F-flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with 
prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of 
cognitive visits = 2.8 ± 1.1). Tau and Aβ PET measures were assessed in regions 
of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex-wise map analyses. Cognitive change was 
evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites.
RESULTS: Higher levels of Aβ and tau were both associated with greater memory 
decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical Aβ was 
associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very 
elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with 
elevated Aβ. A significant interaction between tau and Aβ was observed in both 
ROI and map-level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was 
observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies.
INTERPRETATION: Our results are consistent with the supposition that both Aβ and 
tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These 
findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive 
manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical 
AD. Ann Neurol 2019;00:1-3 ANN NEUROL 2019;85:181-193.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Dementia is one of the brain diseases with serious 
symptoms such as memory loss, and thinking problems. According to the World 
Alzheimer Report 2016, in the world, there are 47 million people having dementia 
and it can be 131 million by 2050. There is no standard method to diagnose 
dementia, and consequently unable to access the treatment effectively. Hence, 
the computational diagnosis of the disease from brain Magnetic Resonance Image 
(MRI) scans plays an important role in supporting the early diagnosis. 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD), a common type of Dementia, includes problems related 
to disorientation, mood swings, not managing self-care, and behavioral issues. 
In this article, we present a new computational method to diagnosis Alzheimer's 
disease from 3D brain MR images.
METHODS: An efficient approach to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI 
scans is proposed comprising two phases: I) segmentation and II) classification, 
both based on deep learning. After the brain tissues are segmented by a model 
that combines Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN), a new model combining Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify Alzheimer's disease based on the 
segmented tissues.
RESULTS: We present two evaluations for segmentation and classification. For 
comparison, the new method was evaluated using the AD-86 and AD-126 datasets 
leading to Dice 0.96 for segmentation in both datasets and accuracies 0.88, and 
0.80 for classification, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning gives prominent results for segmentation and feature 
extraction in medical image processing. The combination of XGboost and SVM 
improves the results obtained.

INTRODUCTION: It is challenging at baseline to predict when and which 
individuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will 
ultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia.
METHODS: A deep learning method is developed and validated based on magnetic 
resonance imaging scans of 2146 subjects (803 for training and 1343 for 
validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD dementia in a 
time-to-event analysis setting.
RESULTS: The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' 
progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762 on 439 Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration 
from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a concordance index of 0.781 
on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI 
subjects with follow-up duration from 18 to 54 months (quartiles: [18, 36, 54]). 
The predicted progression risk also clustered individual subjects into subgroups 
with significant differences in their progression time to AD dementia 
(P < .0002). Improved performance for predicting progression to AD dementia 
(concordance index = 0.864) was obtained when the deep learning-based 
progression risk was combined with baseline clinical measures.
DISCUSSION: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means for 
prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with 
individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.

OBJECTIVE: We investigated the association of plasma amyloid beta (Abeta)40, 
Abeta42, and total tau (tTau) with the presence of Alzheimer pathological 
changes in cognitively normal individuals with subjective cognitive decline 
(SCD).
METHODS: We included 248 subjects with SCD (61 ± 9 years, 42% female, 
Mini-Mental State Examination = 28 ± 2) from the SCIENCe project and Amsterdam 
Dementia Cohort. Subjects were dichotomized as amyloid abnormal by cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Baseline plasma Abeta40, 
Abeta42, and tTau were measured using Simoa technology. Associations between 
plasma levels and amyloid status were assessed using logistic regression 
analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Association of plasma 
levels with risk of clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or 
dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models.
RESULTS: Fifty-seven (23%) subjects were CSF-amyloid abnormal. Plasma 
Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and plasma Abeta42 alone, but not tTau, identified 
abnormal CSF-amyloid status (plasma ratio: area under the curve [AUC] = 77%, 95% 
confidence interval [CI] = 69-84%; plasma Abeta42: AUC = 66%, 95% CI: 58-74%). 
Combining plasma ratio with age and apolipoprotein E resulted in AUC = 83% (95% 
CI = 77-89%). The Youden cutoff of the plasma ratio gave a sensitivity of 76% 
and specificity of 75%, and applying this as a prescreener would reduce the 
number of lumbar punctures by 51%. Using PET as outcome, a comparable reduction 
in number of PET scans would be achieved when applying the plasma ratio as 
prescreener. In addition, low plasma ratio was associated with clinical 
progression to MCI or dementia (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.3).
INTERPRETATION: Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio has potential as a prescreener to 
identify Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with 
SCD. Ann Neurol 2018;84:656-666.

EEG-based Emotion Detection Using Unsupervised Transfer Learning.

Gonzalez HA, Yoo J, Elfadel IM.

Emotion classification using EEG signal processing has the potential of 
significantly improving the social integration of patients suffering from 
neurological disorders such as Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) or the acute 
stages of Alzheimer's disease. One important challenge to the implementation of 
high-fidelity emotion recognition systems is the inadequacy of EEG data in terms 
of Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), duration, and subject-to-subject variability. In 
this paper, we present a novel, integrated framework for semi-generic emotion 
detection using (1) independent component analysis for EEG preprocessing, (2) 
EEG subject clustering by unsupervised learning, and (3) a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) for EEG-based emotion recognition. The training and testing data 
was built using the combination of two publicly available repositories (DEAP and 
DREAMER), and a local dataset collected at Khalifa University using the standard 
International Affective Picture System (IAPS). The CNN classifier with the 
proposed transfer learning approach achieves an average accuracy of 70.26% for 
valence and 72.42% for arousal, which are superior to the reported accuracies of 
all generic (subject-independent) emotion classifiers.

Numerous machine learning (ML) approaches have been proposed for automatic 
classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from brain imaging data. In 
particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks 
(CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification 
performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in 
components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation 
procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their 
frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are 
lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to 
inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present 
work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. 
First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main 
types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and 
iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed 
papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. 
Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for 
classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises 
previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data 
into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, 
classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep 
learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN 
architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very 
beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. 
To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the 
peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 
3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was 
lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM 
with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar 
populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or 
demographical characteristics. All the code of the framework and the experiments 
is publicly available: general-purpose tools have been integrated into the 
Clinica software (www.clinica.run) and the paper-specific code is available at: 
https://github.com/aramis-lab/AD-DL.

Deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) have achieved great success for image 
classification in medical research. Deep learning with brain imaging is the 
imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are "black boxes" owing to their 
low interpretability to humans. The lack of transparency of deep learning 
compromises its application to the prediction and mechanism investigation in AD. 
To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that 
integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and 
genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed 
algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the 
brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic 
variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four 
time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months. The algorithm 
identified brain regions underlying AD consisting of the temporal lobes 
(including the hippocampus) and the ventricular system.

A Novel Multimodal MRI Analysis for Alzheimer's Disease Based on Convolutional 
Neural Network.

Wang Y, Yang Y, Guo X, Ye C, Gao N, Fang Y, Ma HT.

Recent years, Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a significant threat to human 
health while the accurate screening and diagnosis of AD remain a tough problem. 
Multimodal Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help to identify the variation 
of brain function and structure in a non-invasive way. Deep learning, especially 
the convolutional neural networks (CNN), can be utilized to automatically detect 
appropriate features for classification, which is well adapted for 
computer-aided AD screening and identification. This paper proposed a multimodal 
MRI analytical method based on CNN, which is also suitable for single type MRI 
data analysis. First, the human brain network connectivity matrix were extracted 
from multimodal MRI data, used as the input data for CNN. Then a novel CNN 
framework was proposed to process the network matrix and classify AD, amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients and normal controls (NC). The 
advantage of this method lies in that we combined multimodal MRI information 
through CNN convolution kernel, and achieved a higher classification accuracy. 
In our experiments, the comprehensive classification accuracy of AD, aMCI 
patients and NC was as high as 92.06% when using multimodal MRI data as input, 
which is effective enough to provide a reference for multimodal MRI data 
analysis.

Previous work has suggested that evoked potential analysis might allow the 
detection of subjects with new-onset Alzheimer's disease, which would be useful 
clinically and personally. Here, it is described how subjects with new-onset 
Alzheimer's disease have been differentiated from healthy, normal subjects to 
100% accuracy, based on the back-projected independent components (BICs) of the 
P300 peak at the electroencephalogram electrodes in the response to an oddball, 
auditory-evoked potential paradigm. After artifact removal, clustering, 
selection, and normalization processes, the BICs were classified using a neural 
network, a Bayes classifier, and a voting strategy. The technique is general and 
might be applied for presymptomatic detection and to other conditions and evoked 
potentials, although further validation with more subjects, preferably in 
multicenter studies is recommended.

In the context of neuro-pathological disorders, neuroimaging has been widely 
accepted as a clinical tool for diagnosing patients with Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The advanced deep learning method, a 
novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its 
contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional 
convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The 
dataset from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to 
compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector 
machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with 
ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were [Formula: see 
text]%, [Formula: see text]% and [Formula: see text]% respectively. The 
3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 
96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM 
showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that 
'NC versus MCI' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% 
and 98.80%; 'NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 
99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and 'MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and 
specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly 
demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to 
currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be 
efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is 
totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This 
suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and 
extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, 
noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV 
may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population. 
This study holds value in distinguishing AD and MCI subjects from normal 
controls and to improve value-based care of patients in clinical practice.

Graph convolutional neural networks (GCNNs) aim to extend the data 
representation and classification capabilities of convolutional neural networks, 
which are highly effective for signals defined on regular Euclidean domains, 
e.g. image and audio signals, to irregular, graph-structured data defined on 
non-Euclidean domains. Graph-theoretic tools that enable us to study the brain 
as a complex system are of great significance in brain connectivity studies. 
Particularly, in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative 
disorder associated with network dysfunction, graph-based tools are vital for 
disease classification and staging. Here, we implement and test a multi-class 
GCNN classifier for network-based classification of subjects on the AD spectrum 
into four categories: cognitively normal, early mild cognitive impairment, late 
mild cognitive impairment, and AD. We train and validate the network using 
structural connectivity graphs obtained from diffusion tensor imaging data. 
Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we show that the GCNN classifier 
outperforms a support vector machine classifier by margins that are reliant on 
disease category. Our findings indicate that the performance gap between the two 
methods increases with disease progression from CN to AD. We thus demonstrate 
that GCNN is a competitive tool for staging and classification of subjects on 
the AD spectrum.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative 
disorder. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. 
Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are 
available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the 
prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of 
the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and 
volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer 
from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is 
independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal 
performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework 
based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal 
segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a 
multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal 
segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely 
Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D 
patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the 
classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and 
DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated 
on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 
119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity 
coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed 
method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 
92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 
77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates 
that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and 
several other competing methods.

OBJECTIVE: Aging is the highest risk factor for Parkinson disease (PD). Under 
physiological conditions, spermidine and spermine experimentally enhance 
longevity via autophagy induction. Accordingly, we evaluated the ability of each 
polyamine metabolite to act as an age-related, diagnostic, and 
severity-associated PD biomarker.
METHODS: Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A 
(controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites 
in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 
19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were 
successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity 
was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's 
Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III). Additionally, the autophagy 
induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various 
cell lines.
RESULTS: In Cohort A, N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetylputrescine levels were 
significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine 
levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, 
concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, N1,N8-diacetylspermidine levels 
had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&Y, UPDRS-III, and axonal 
degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls 
declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine 
metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH-SY5Y 
cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated 
with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls.
INTERPRETATION: Spermine synthesis and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine may respectively 
be useful diagnostic and severity-associated biomarkers for PD. ANN NEUROL

OBJECTIVE: Accumulation of amyloid-β is among the earliest changes in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β positron emission tomography (PET) and Aβ42 
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) both assess amyloid-β pathology in-vivo, but 10-20% 
of cases show discordant (CSF+/PET- or CSF-/PET+) results. The neuropathological 
correspondence with amyloid-β CSF/PET discordance is unknown.
METHODS: We included 21 patients from our tertiary memory clinic who had 
undergone both CSF Aβ42 analysis and amyloid-β PET, and had neuropathological 
data available. Amyloid-β PET and CSF results were compared with 
neuropathological ABC scores (comprising of Thal (A), Braak (B), and CERAD (C) 
stage, all ranging from 0 [low] to 3 [high]) and neuropathological diagnosis.
RESULTS: Neuropathological diagnosis was AD in 11 (52%) patients. Amyloid-β PET 
was positive in all A3, C2, and C3 cases and in one of the two A2 cases. CSF 
Aβ42 was positive in 92% of ≥A2 and 90% of ≥C2 cases. PET and CSF were 
discordant in three of 21 (14%) cases: CSF+/PET- in a patient with 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (A0B0C0), CSF+/PET- in a patient with FTLD-TDP 
type B (A2B1C1), and CSF-/PET+ in a patient with AD (A3B3C3). Two CSF+/PET+ 
cases had a non-AD neuropathological diagnosis, that is FTLD-TDP type E (A3B1C1) 
and adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (A1B1C0).
INTERPRETATION: Our study demonstrates neuropathological underpinnings of 
amyloid-β CSF/PET discordance. Furthermore, amyloid-β biomarker positivity on 
both PET and CSF did not invariably result in an AD diagnosis at autopsy, 
illustrating the importance of considering relevant comorbidities when 
evaluating amyloid-β biomarker results.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationships between MRI volumetry and [18 
F]flortaucipir PET of typical and atypical clinical phenotypes of Alzheimer's 
disease, by genarian (age by decade).
METHODS: Five-hundred and sixty-four participants including those with typical 
(n = 86) or atypical (n = 80) Alzheimer's dementia and normal controls (n = 398) 
underwent apolipoprotein E genotyping, MRI, flortaucipir, and 11 C-PiB; all 166 
Alzheimer's participants were beta-amyloid positive and all controls were 
beta-amyloid negative. Grey matter volume and flortaucipir standard uptake value 
ratios were calculated for hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and neocortex. Ratios 
of hippocampal-to-neocortical and entorhinal-to-neocortical volume and 
flortaucipir uptake were also calculated. Linear regression models assessed 
relationships among regional volume, flortaucipir uptake, and ratios and 
phenotypes, within three genarians (50-59, 60-69, and 70+). Voxel-level analyses 
were also performed.
RESULTS: For 50-59 greater medial temporal atrophy and flortaucipir uptake was 
observed in the typical compared with atypical phenotype. The typical phenotype 
also showed greater frontal neocortex uptake with the voxel-level analysis. For 
60-69 and 70+ there was greater hippocampal volume loss in the typical compared 
with atypical phenotype while only the 60-69, but not the 70+ group, showed a 
difference in hippocampal flortaucipir uptake. We also observed a pattern for 
higher neocortical flortaucipir uptake to correlate with younger age decade for 
both phenotypes.
INTERPRETATION: MRI volumetry versus flortaucipir PET relationships differ 
across Alzheimer's clinical phenotypes, and also within phenotype across age 
decades. This suggests that there is potential risk of masked effects by not 
accounting for genarian in participants with beta-amyloid and tau-positive 
biomarker defined Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: We propose a classification method for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
based on the texture of the hippocampus, which is the organ that is most 
affected by the onset of AD.
METHODS: We obtained magnetic resonance images (MRIs) of Alzheimer's patients 
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. This 
dataset consists of image data for AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 
normal controls (NCs), classified according to the cognitive condition. In this 
study, the research methods included image processing, texture analyses, and 
deep learning. Firstly, images were acquired for texture analyses, which were 
then re-spaced, registered, and cropped with Gabor filters applied to the 
resulting image data. In the texture analyses, we applied the 3-dimensional (3D) 
gray-level co-occurrence (GLCM) method to evaluate the textural features of the 
image, and used Fisher's coefficient to select the appropriate features for 
classification. In the last stage, we implemented a deep learning multi-layer 
perceptron (MLP) model, which we divided into three types, namely, AD-MCI, 
AD-NC, and MCI-NC.
RESULTS: We used this model to assess the accuracy of the proposed method. The 
classification accuracy of the proposed deep learning model was confirmed in the 
cases of AD-MCI (72.5%), ADNC (85%), and MCI-NC (75%). We also evaluated the 
results obtained using a confusion matrix, support vector machine (SVM), and 
K-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier and analyzed the results to objectively 
verify our model. We obtained the highest accuracy of 85% in the AD-NC.
CONCLUSION: The proposed model was at least 6-19% more accurate than the SVM and 
KNN classifiers, respectively. Hence, this study confirms the validity and 
superiority of the proposed method, which can be used as a diagnostic tool for 
early Alzheimer's diagnosis.

Convolutional neural network (CNN) models have recently demonstrated impressive 
performance in medical image analysis. However, there is no clear understanding 
of why they perform so well, or what they have learned. In this paper, a 
three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is employed to classify 
brain MRI scans into two predefined groups. In addition, a genetic algorithm 
based brain masking (GABM) method is proposed as a visualization technique that 
provides new insights into the function of the 3D-CNN. The proposed GABM method 
consists of two main steps. In the first step, a set of brain MRI scans is used 
to train the 3D-CNN. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to 
discover knowledgeable brain regions in the MRI scans. The knowledgeable regions 
are those areas of the brain which the 3D-CNN has mostly used to extract 
important and discriminative features from them. For applying GA on the brain 
MRI scans, a new chromosome encoding approach is proposed. The proposed 
framework has been evaluated using ADNI (including 140 subjects for Alzheimer's 
disease classification) and ABIDE (including 1000 subjects for Autism 
classification) brain MRI datasets. Experimental results show a 5-fold 
classification accuracy of 0.85 for the ADNI dataset and 0.70 for the ABIDE 
dataset. The proposed GABM method has extracted 6 to 65 knowledgeable brain 
regions in ADNI dataset (and 15 to 75 knowledgeable brain regions in ABIDE 
dataset). These regions are interpreted as the segments of the brain which are 
mostly used by the 3D-CNN to extract features for brain disease classification. 
Experimental results show that besides the model interpretability, the proposed 
GABM method has increased final performance of the classification model in some 
cases with respect to model parameters.

PURPOSE: Although quantification of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
is important for evaluating patients with cognitive impairment, its routine 
clinical use is hampered by complicated preprocessing steps and required MRI. 
Here, we suggested a one-step quantification based on deep learning using 
native-space amyloid PET images of different radiotracers acquired from multiple 
centers.
METHODS: Amyloid PET data of the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) were used for this study. A training/validation consists of 850 
florbetapir PET images. Three hundred sixty-six florbetapir and 89 florbetaben 
PET images were used as test sets to evaluate the model. Native-space amyloid 
PET images were used as inputs, and the outputs were standardized uptake value 
ratios (SUVRs) calculated by the conventional MR-based method.
RESULTS: The mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the composite SUVR were 0.040, 
0.060, and 0.050 of training/validation and test sets for florbetapir PET and a 
test set for florbetaben PET, respectively. The agreement of amyloid positivity 
measured by Cohen's kappa for test sets of florbetapir and florbetaben PET were 
0.87 and 0.89, respectively.
CONCLUSION: We suggest a one-step quantification method for amyloid PET via a 
deep learning model. The model is highly reliable to quantify the amyloid PET 
regardless of multicenter images and various radiotracers.

SUV ratios (SUVRs) are commonly used to quantify tracer uptake in amyloid-β PET. 
Here, we explore the impact of target and reference region-of-interest (ROI) 
selection on SUVR effect sizes using interventional data from the ongoing phase 
1b PRIME study (NCT01677572) of aducanumab (BIIB037) in patients with prodromal 
or mild Alzheimer disease. Methods: The florbetapir PET SUVR was calculated at 
baseline (screening) and at weeks 26 and 54 for patients randomized to receive 
placebo and each of 4 aducanumab doses (1, 3, 6, and 10 mg/kg) using the whole 
cerebellum, cerebellar gray matter, cerebellar white matter, pons, and 
subcortical white matter as reference regions. In addition to the prespecified 
composite cortex target ROI, individual cerebral cortical ROIs were assessed as 
targets. Results: Of the reference regions used, subcortical white matter, 
cerebellar white matter, and the pons, alone or in combination, generated the 
largest effect sizes. The use of the anterior cingulate cortex as a target ROI 
resulted in larger effect sizes than the use of the composite cortex. SUVR 
calculations were not affected by correction for brain volume changes over time. 
Conclusion: Dose- and time-dependent reductions in the amyloid PET SUVR were 
consistently observed with aducanumab only in cortical regions prone to amyloid 
plaque deposition, regardless of the reference region used. These data support 
the hypothesis that florbetapir SUVR responses associated with aducanumab 
treatment are a result of specific dose- and time-dependent reductions in the 
amyloid burden in patients with Alzheimer disease.

Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range of 
clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the central nervous 
system leading to loss of brain function and eventual death. The most prevalent 
of these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects approximately 50 million 
people worldwide and is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative 
diseases can only be fully diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological 
assessment of the type and distribution of protein deposits which characterise 
each different condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in 
aiding patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these conditions for 
many years. In this review, we consider the range of MR-based measurements and 
describe the findings in AD, but also contrast these with the second most common 
dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The most definitive observation is 
the major structural brain changes seen in AD using conventional T1-weighted 
(T1w) MRI, where medial temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most 
symptomatic patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings 
are sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic 
criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in tissue 
microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional 
anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter structures. There are 
suggestions that there are subtle differences between AD and DLB populations. At 
the metabolic level, atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of 
healthy neurons in brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to 
show higher deposits of pathogenic proteins. As studies have moved from patients 
with advanced disease and clear dysfunction to patients with earlier 
presentation such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some 
represents the first signs of their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to 
detect differences has been weaker and further work is still required, ideally 
in much larger cohorts than previously studied. The vast majority of imaging 
research in dementia populations has been univariate with respect to the 
MR-derived parameters considered. To date, none of these measurements has 
uniquely replicated the patterns of tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, 
and the ability of MR techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. 
Future opportunities may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches 
(position emission tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of 
structural and metabolic changes. Such developments will require multi-variate 
analyses, possibly combined with artificial intelligence or deep learning 
algorithms, to enhance our ability to combine the array of image-derived 
information, genetic, gender and lifestyle factors.

Background and Purpose- Cerebral small vessel disease is characterized by a wide 
range of focal and global brain changes. We used a magnetic resonance imaging 
segmentation tool to quantify multiple types of small vessel disease-related 
brain changes and examined their individual and combined predictive value on 
cognitive and functional abilities. Methods- Magnetic resonance imaging scans of 
560 older individuals from LADIS (Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study) were 
analyzed using automated atlas- and convolutional neural network-based 
segmentation methods yielding volumetric measures of white matter 
hyperintensities, lacunes, enlarged perivascular spaces, chronic cortical 
infarcts, and global and regional brain atrophy. The subjects were followed up 
with annual neuropsychological examinations for 3 years and evaluation of 
instrumental activities of daily living for 7 years. Results- The strongest 
predictors of cognitive performance and functional outcome over time were the 
total volumes of white matter hyperintensities, gray matter, and hippocampi 
(P<0.001 for global cognitive function, processing speed, executive functions, 
and memory and P<0.001 for poor functional outcome). Volumes of lacunes, 
enlarged perivascular spaces, and cortical infarcts were significantly 
associated with part of the outcome measures, but their contribution was weaker. 
In a multivariable linear mixed model, volumes of white matter hyperintensities, 
lacunes, gray matter, and hippocampi remained as independent predictors of 
cognitive impairment. A combined measure of these markers based on Z scores 
strongly predicted cognitive and functional outcomes (P<0.001) even above the 
contribution of the individual brain changes. Conclusions- Global burden of 
small vessel disease-related brain changes as quantified by an image 
segmentation tool is a powerful predictor of long-term cognitive decline and 
functional disability. A combined measure of white matter hyperintensities, 
lacunar, gray matter, and hippocampal volumes could be used as an imaging marker 
associated with vascular cognitive impairment.

OBJECTIVE: Adults with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer disease (AD) 
pathology by their 5th decade. Compared with the general population, traditional 
vascular risks in adults with DS are rare, allowing examination of 
cerebrovascular disease in this population and insight into its role in AD 
without the confound of vascular risk factors. We examined in vivo magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults 
with DS, and determined their cross-sectional relationship with age, 
beta-amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic 
status.
METHODS: Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down 
Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 ± 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n 
= 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived 
MRI-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter 
hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged 
perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET-based biomarkers of amyloid burden. 
Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive 
impairment-DS (MCI-DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on 
in-depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status.
RESULTS: There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as 
early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, 
enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS < MCI-DS < 
possible AD dementia < definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was 
associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct.
INTERPRETATION: The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease 
in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates 
cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity.

Deep learning has emerged as a powerful approach to constructing imaging 
signatures of normal brain ageing as well as of various neuropathological 
processes associated with brain diseases. In particular, MRI-derived brain age 
has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify 
both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain 
ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia 
and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior 
efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated 
and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or 
diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, 
and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we 
develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large 
(n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning 
different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. 
Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 
individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from 
these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation 
and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing 
models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals 
with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models 
naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, 
and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some 
experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show 
that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher 
differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease 
groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along 
with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of 
several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient 
versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as 
ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce 
the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning 
networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for 
MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the 
lifespan.

Precision medicine for Alzheimer's disease (AD) necessitates the development of 
personalized, reproducible, and neuroscientifically interpretable biomarkers, 
yet despite remarkable advances, few such biomarkers are available. Also, a 
comprehensive evaluation of the neurobiological basis and generalizability of 
the end-to-end machine learning system should be given the highest priority. For 
this reason, a deep learning model (3D attention network, 3DAN) that can 
simultaneously capture candidate imaging biomarkers with an attention mechanism 
module and advance the diagnosis of AD based on structural magnetic resonance 
imaging is proposed. The generalizability and reproducibility are evaluated 
using cross-validation on in-house, multicenter (n = 716), and public (n = 1116) 
databases with an accuracy up to 92%. Significant associations between the 
classification output and clinical characteristics of AD and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI, a middle stage of dementia) groups provide solid 
neurobiological support for the 3DAN model. The effectiveness of the 3DAN model 
is further validated by its good performance in predicting the MCI subjects who 
progress to AD with an accuracy of 72%. Collectively, the findings highlight the 
potential for structural brain imaging to provide a generalizable, and 
neuroscientifically interpretable imaging biomarker that can support clinicians 
in the early diagnosis of AD.

Automated methods for Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification have the potential 
for great clinical benefits and may provide insight for combating the disease. 
Machine learning, and more specifically deep neural networks, have been shown to 
have great efficacy in this domain. These algorithms often use neurological 
imaging data such as MRI and FDG PET, but a comprehensive and balanced 
comparison of the MRI and amyloid PET modalities has not been performed. In 
order to accurately determine the relative strength of each imaging variant, 
this work performs a comparison study in the context of Alzheimer's dementia 
classification using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
dataset with identical neural network architectures. Furthermore, this work 
analyzes the benefits of using both modalities in a fusion setting and discusses 
how these data types may be leveraged in future AD studies using deep learning.

INTRODUCTION: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common in older adults and 
represents a high-risk group for progression to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Medication trials in MCI have generally failed, but new discoveries with brain 
plasticity in ageing have led to the study of cognitive training as a potential 
treatment to improve cognitive abilities. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) 
involves computerised cognitive exercises that target specific cognitive 
abilities and neural networks to potentially improve cognitive functioning 
through neuroplasticity.
METHODS AND ANALYSIS: In a two-site study (New York State Psychiatric 
Institute/Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical 
Center), we will randomise 100 patients with MCI (Wechsler Memory Scale-III 
Logical Memory II score 0-11; Folstein Mini Mental State Examination ≥23) to 
home-based CCT (suite of exercises: memory, matching, spatial recognition, 
processing speed) or a home-based active control condition (computerised 
crossword puzzle training (CPT)) with 12 weeks of intensive training followed by 
regular booster sessions up to 78 weeks. All patients will receive standard 
neuropsychological and functional assessments in clinic as well as 
structural/functional brain MRI scans at study entry and endpoint. We will test 
if CCT, versus CPT, leads to improved cognitive functioning, transfers to 
functional ability and tasks of everyday life and impacts hippocampal volume 
changes and changes in the default mode network of the brain measured by 
resting-state functional MRI.
ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study will be conducted following ethics approval 
and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. Study results 
will be disseminated via publication, clinicaltrials.gov, media and conference 
presentations. This will be the first controlled long-term trial to evaluate the 
effects of home-based CCT versus computerised CPT on cognitive abilities and 
functional measures and neural outcomes as determined by MRI indices in patients 
with MCI. Positive results from trial may support further development of 
home-based CCT.

neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Hippocampal atrophy can be evaluated in terms of hippocampal 
volumes and shapes using structural MR images. However, the shape and volume 
features from hippocampus mask have limited discriminative information for AD 
diagnosis. In addition, extraction of these features is independent of 
classification model, resulting to sub-optimal performance for disease 
diagnosis.
NEW METHOD: This paper proposes a hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural 
network for more detailed hippocampus analysis using structural MR images in AD. 
The DenseNets are constructed on the decomposed image patches of internal and 
external hippocampus to learn the intensity and shape features. Recurrent neural 
network (RNN) is cascaded to combine the features from the left and right 
hippocampus and learn the high-level features for disease classification.
RESULTS: Our proposed method is evaluated with the baseline MR images of 807 
subjects including 194 AD, 397 MCI and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experiments show the proposed 
method achieves AUC (area under ROC curve) of 91.0%, 75.8% and 74.6% for 
classifications of AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI, respectively.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed method achieves better 
performance than the volume and shape analysis methods.
CONCLUSIONS: A hybrid convolutional and recurrent neural network was proposed by 
combining DenseNets and bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) for 
hippocampus analysis and AD diagnosis. Results show its promising performance.

A World Health Organization (WHO) Feb 2018 report has recently shown that 
mortality rate due to brain or central nervous system (CNS) cancer is the 
highest in the Asian continent. It is of critical importance that cancer be 
detected earlier so that many of these lives can be saved. Cancer grading is an 
important aspect for targeted therapy. As cancer diagnosis is highly invasive, 
time consuming and expensive, there is an immediate requirement to develop a 
non-invasive, cost-effective and efficient tools for brain cancer 
characterization and grade estimation. Brain scans using magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), as well as other imaging modalities, 
are fast and safer methods for tumor detection. In this paper, we tried to 
summarize the pathophysiology of brain cancer, imaging modalities of brain 
cancer and automatic computer assisted methods for brain cancer characterization 
in a machine and deep learning paradigm. Another objective of this paper is to 
find the current issues in existing engineering methods and also project a 
future paradigm. Further, we have highlighted the relationship between brain 
cancer and other brain disorders like stroke, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and 
Wilson's disease, leukoriaosis, and other neurological disorders in the context 
of machine learning and the deep learning paradigm.

The tropomyosin receptor kinases family (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) supports neuronal 
growth, survival, and differentiation during development, adult life, and aging. 
TrkA/B/C downregulation is a prominent hallmark of various neurological 
disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormally expressed or 
overexpressed full-length or oncogenic fusion TrkA/B/C proteins were shown to 
drive tumorigenesis in a variety of neurogenic and non-neurogenic human cancers 
and are currently the focus of intensive clinical research. Neurologic and 
oncologic studies of the spatiotemporal alterations in TrkA/B/C expression and 
density and the determination of target engagement of emerging antineoplastic 
clinical inhibitors in normal and diseased tissue are crucially needed but have 
remained largely unexplored due to the lack of suitable non-invasive probes. 
Here, we review the recent development of carbon-11- and fluorine-18-labeled 
positron emission tomography (PET) radioligands based on specifically designed 
small molecule kinase catalytic domain-binding inhibitors of TrkA/B/C. Basic 
developments in medicinal chemistry, radiolabeling and translational PET imaging 
in multiple species including humans are highlighted.

Human age prediction is an interesting and applicable issue in different fields. 
It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest 
plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age 
prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image 
processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the 
investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The 
implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical 
applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent 
years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative 
diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based 
on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and 
accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative 
diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper 
reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI 
images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research 
works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two 
factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, 
surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML 
algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern 
techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are 
more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have 
been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and 
getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in 
each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future 
research are suggested.

OBJECTIVE: Unawareness, or anosognosia, of memory deficits is a challenging 
manifestation of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that adversely affects a patient's 
safety and decision-making. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the 
presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function 
across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to 
characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to 
beta-amyloid (Aβ) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the 
disease spectrum.
METHODS: Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits 
= 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and 
partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). Aβ deposition 
was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic 
imaging.
RESULTS: Aβ predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that 
awareness decreased faster in participants with increased Aβ burden. Aβ and 
clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating 
the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the 
cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who 
progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was 
observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining 
until the time of progression to MCI (-0.08 discrepant-points/yr). In a subset 
of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and 
continued to decline (-0.23 discrepant-points/yr), reaching anosognosia 
3.2 years before dementia onset.
INTERPRETATION: Aβ burden is associated with a progressive decrease in 
self-awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years 
before dementia diagnosis. ANN NEUROL 2020;87:267-280.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the multifactorial processes underlying cognitive 
aging based on the hypothesis that multiple causal pathways and mechanisms 
(amyloid, vascular, and resilience) influence longitudinal cognitive decline in 
each individual through worsening brain health.
METHODS: We identified 1,230 elderly subjects (aged ≥50 years) with an average 
of 4.9 years of clinical follow-up and with amyloid positron emission 
tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging 
scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging 
markers of amyloid and brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and 
cortical thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and 
early to midlife intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal cognitive 
trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling longitudinal 
cognitive decline.
RESULTS: All the pathways (amyloid, vascular, resilience) converged through 
their effects on cortical thinning and worsening cognition and together 
explained patterns in cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging 
process, sex differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) 
had significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity. 
Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity through 
systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity contributed to 
significant cortical thinning and subsequently longitudinal cognitive decline. 
Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a significant proportion of cognitive 
decline that accelerated with longer follow-up times, and its primary impact was 
through cortical thinning.
INTERPRETATION: We developed an integrated framework to help explain the dynamic 
and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal pathways. Such 
an approach is important for both better comprehension of cognitive aging 
processes and will aid in the development of successful intervention strategies.

OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate whether neurodegenerative biomarkers in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) differentiate patients with suspected normal pressure 
hydrocephalus (NPH) who respond to CSF drainage from patients who do not 
respond.
METHODS: Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance 
imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait 
functions before and after drainage of 40-50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 
protein, neuron-specific enolase, β-amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho-tau 
were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and 
multiple linear regression.
RESULTS: Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 
28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait-related functions after CSF 
drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for 
Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait-related 
functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for 
Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.
INTERPRETATION: Our data suggest an association between Alzheimer's disease and 
NPH changes, supporting the recently suggested dichotomy of a neurodegenerative 
NPH and a true idiopathic NPH, with the latter appearing to be rare. ANN NEUROL

Combining machine learning with neuroimaging data has a great potential for 
early diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
However, it remains unclear how well the classifiers built on one population can 
predict MCI/AD diagnosis of other populations. This study aimed to employ a 
spectral graph convolutional neural network (graph-CNN), that incorporated 
cortical thickness and geometry, to identify MCI and AD based on 3089 
T1-weighted MRI data of the ADNI-2 cohort, and to evaluate its feasibility to 
predict AD in the ADNI-1 cohort (n = 3602) and an Asian cohort (n = 347). For 
the ADNI-2 cohort, the graph-CNN showed classification accuracy of controls (CN) 
vs. AD at 85.8% and early MCI (EMCI) vs. AD at 79.2%, followed by CN vs. late 
MCI (LMCI) (69.3%), LMCI vs. AD (65.2%), EMCI vs. LMCI (60.9%), and CN vs. EMCI 
(51.8%). We demonstrated the robustness of the graph-CNN among the existing deep 
learning approaches, such as Euclidean-domain-based multilayer network and 1D 
CNN on cortical thickness, and 2D and 3D CNNs on T1-weighted MR images of the 
ADNI-2 cohort. The graph-CNN also achieved the prediction on the conversion of 
EMCI to AD at 75% and that of LMCI to AD at 92%. The find-tuned graph-CNN 
further provided a promising CN vs. AD classification accuracy of 89.4% on the 
ADNI-1 cohort and >90% on the Asian cohort. Our study demonstrated the 
feasibility to transfer AD/MCI classifiers learned from one population to the 
other. Notably, incorporating cortical geometry in CNN has the potential to 
improve classification performance.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia, 
typically characterized by memory loss followed by progressive cognitive decline 
and functional impairment. Many clinical trials of potential therapies for AD 
have failed, and there is currently no approved disease-modifying treatment. 
Biomarkers for early detection and mechanistic understanding of disease course 
are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the 
focus of most biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based 
framework to identify informative features for AD classification using tau 
positron emission tomography (PET) scans.
RESULTS: The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model of 
AD from cognitively normal (CN) yielded an average accuracy of 90.8% based on 
five-fold cross-validation. The LRP model identified the brain regions in tau 
PET images that contributed most to the AD classification from CN. The top 
identified regions included the hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus, and 
fusiform. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) results were consistent 
with those from the voxel-wise analysis in SPM12, showing significant focal AD 
associated regional tau deposition in the bilateral temporal lobes including the 
entorhinal cortex. The AD probability scores calculated by the classifier were 
correlated with brain tau deposition in the medial temporal lobe in MCI 
participants (r = 0.43 for early MCI and r = 0.49 for late MCI).
CONCLUSION: A deep learning framework combining 3D CNN and LRP algorithms can be 
used with tau PET images to identify informative features for AD classification 
and may have application for early detection during prodromal stages of AD.

Classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) has been becoming a hot issue along 
with the rapidly increasing number of patients. This task remains tremendously 
challenging due to the limited data and the difficulties in detecting mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing methods use gait [or EEG 
(electroencephalogram)] data only to tackle this task. Although the gait data 
acquisition procedure is cheap and simple, the methods relying on gait data 
often fail to detect the slight difference between MCI and AD. The methods that 
use EEG data can detect the difference more precisely, but collecting EEG data 
from both HC (health controls) and patients is very time-consuming. More 
critically, these methods often convert EEG records into the frequency domain 
and thus inevitably lose the spatial and temporal information, which is 
essential to capture the connectivity and synchronization among different brain 
regions. This paper proposes a cascade neural network with two steps to achieve 
a faster and more accurate AD classification by exploiting gait and EEG data 
simultaneously. In the first step, we propose attention-based spatial temporal 
graph convolutional networks to extract the features from the skeleton sequences 
(i.e., gait) captured by Kinect (a commonly used sensor) to distinguish between 
HC and patients. In the second step, we propose spatial temporal convolutional 
networks to fully exploit the spatial and temporal information of EEG data and 
classify the patients into MCI or AD eventually. We collect gait and EEG data 
from 35 cognitively health controls, 35 MCI, and 17 AD patients to evaluate our 
proposed method. Experimental results show that our method significantly 
outperforms other AD diagnosis methods (91.07 vs. 68.18%) in the three-way AD 
classification task (HC, MCI, and AD). Moreover, we empirically found that the 
lower body and right upper limb are more important for the early diagnosis of AD 
than other body parts. We believe this interesting finding can be helpful for 
clinical researches.

OBJECTIVE: Preclinical evidence with nilotinib, a US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA)-approved drug for leukemia, indicates improvement in 
Alzheimer's disease phenotypes. We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and 
detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: This single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild 
to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by 
cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. 
Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 
26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks.
RESULTS: Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 
70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well-tolerated, although more adverse events, 
particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib 
group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in 
the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid Aβ40 was 
reduced at 6 months and Aβ42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group 
compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (-27%) at 12 
months and phospho-tau-181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the 
nilotinib group.
INTERPRETATION: Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant 
cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in 
response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, 
multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in 
Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2020 ANN NEUROL 2020;88:183-194.

Conflict of interest statement: C.M. is an inventor on several US and 
international Georgetown University patents to use nilotinib and other tyrosine 
kinase inhibitors as a treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. C.M., his 
laboratory, and Georgetown University previously received some income from 
licensing of the technology to Axovant Science. Georgetown University spun out 
the technology (April 2020) to a start‐up company (KeifeRX LLC), from which C.M. 
receives consulting fees and Georgetown University, C.M., and F.L.P. receive 
equities and Y.T.‐Y. is an advisor. An individual and institutional conflict 
management plan (CMP) determines that C.M. can design a study as the (inventor) 
person who discovered the potential effects of nilotinib in neurodegenerative 
diseases (thus conceived of the study), can serve as a corresponding principal 
investigator (PI) and senior author but cannot serve as a clinical PI of any 
nilotinib clinical study. C.M. must not determine participants' eligibility and 
must not consent participants. C.M. does not perform primary clinical data 
analysis and all primary CSF biomarkers analyzed in C.M. laboratory and 
Georgetown University by blinded investigators must be validated by an external 
and independent organization using comparable technologies and methods (see 
Acknowledgments). All investigators must be blinded to treatments until all data 
are analyzed per group and unblinded by an externally independent DSMB (see 
Acknowledgments). An external independent study monitor follows study progress 
and adherence to the protocol. Study visits, scheduled events, and adherence to 
study protocol are verified by independent nurses and staff of the CRU (see 
Acknowledgments), which is a Translational Science Awards Program (CTSA). No 
other authors have any related conflicts of interest. C.M. discovered the 
potential use of nilotinib in preclinical models and conceived of this phase 2 
clinical study and contributed with R.S.T. to the protocol and study design 
based on his understanding of nilotinib mechanisms of action in preclinical 
models, especially in relation to nilotinib effects on CNS biomarkers in AD, 
hence, he is a corresponding and senior author. In adherence with the CMP, C.M. 
did not provide any scientific or statistical analysis (J.A., R.S.T., and 
M.L.H.) of the data and the other authors who performed the experiments (R.S.T., 
G.E., F.B., and X.L.) have analyzed the data with other members (M.L.H., X.J., 
S.M., M.A., M.S., and S.M.) of the study team who managed the data (S.M., D.F., 
W.S., M.L.H., M.A., M.S.) and prepared the figures and performed statistical 
analysis (J.A. and M.L.H.). C.M. was not the clinical principal investigator 
(PI) who (R.S.T.) executed the protocol and monitored patients (N.J.S., A.L., 
N.Y., A.L.M., M.A., and Y.T.‐Y.). All safety, biomarkers, and clinical data were 
unblinded by the DMSB and analyzed by S.M., D.F., M.A., M.L.H., W.S., and S.M., 
and figures and tables were prepared by M.L.H. and J.A. by the study team. C.M. 
contributed to manuscript drafting and all authors contributed to the 
interpretation of the data and approved the final version of manuscript.

OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of amyloid positivity, defined by positron 
emission tomography (PET)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and/or 
neuropathological examination, in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) variants.
METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from 
1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], 
nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable 
[n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-β pathology 
(CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The 
estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and 
apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 status was determined using generalized estimating 
equation models.
RESULTS: Amyloid-β positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86%) than in nfvPPA 
(20%) or svPPA (16%; p < 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-β positivity increased 
with age in nfvPPA (from 10% at age 50 years to 27% at age 80 years, p < 0.01) 
and svPPA (from 6% at age 50 years to 32% at age 80 years, p < 0.001), but not 
in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE ε4 carriers were more often 
amyloid-β positive (58.0%) than noncarriers (35.0%, p < 0.001). Autopsy data 
revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in 
lvPPA (76%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in svPPA (80%), and 
frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64%).
INTERPRETATION: This study shows that the current PPA classification system 
helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical 
settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when 
interpreting amyloid-β biomarkers in PPA patients. Ann Neurol 2018;84:737-748.

PURPOSE: Knowing the course of Alzheimer's disease is very important to prevent 
the deterioration of the disease, and accurate segmentation of sensitive lesions 
can provide a visual basis for the diagnosis results. This study proposes an 
improved end-to-end dual-functional 3D convolutional neural network for 
segmenting bilateral hippocampi from 3D brain MRI scans and diagnosing AD 
progression states simultaneously.
METHODS: The proposed neural network is based on the V-Net and adopts an 
end-to-end structure. In order to relieve the excessive amount of convolutional 
parameters at the bottom of the V-Net, we change them to bottleneck 
architecture. Based on the segmentation network, we establish a classification 
network for diagnosing pathological states of brain. In order to balance the two 
tasks of hippocampi segmentation and brain pathological states diagnosis, we 
designed a unique loss function. This study included 132 samples, of which 100 
were selected as training, and the remaining 32 were used to test the 
performance of our model. During training, we adopted fivefold cross-validation 
method.
RESULTS: We selected the intersection over union and dice coefficient to 
evaluate the hippocampus segmentation performance, while the brain pathological 
states diagnosis performance was evaluated by accuracy, specificity, 
sensitivity, precision and F1 score. By using the proposed neural network, the 
left hippocampi segmentation Iou and dice coefficient reach 0.8240 ± 0.020 and 
0.9035 ± 0.020, respectively. The right hippocampi Iou and dice coefficient 
reach 0.8454 ± 0.023 and 0.9162 ± 0.023, respectively. The accuracy, 
specificity, sensitivity, precision and F1 score of three-category 
classification of brain pathology are 84%, 92%, 84%, 86% and 85%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: The proposed neural network has two functions of brain pathological 
states diagnosis and bilateral hippocampi segmentation with higher robustness 
and accuracy, respectively. The segmented bilateral hippocampi can be used as a 
reference for clinical decision making or intervention.

Many neurological diseases and delineating pathological regions have been 
analyzed, and the anatomical structure of the brain researched with the aid of 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It is important to identify patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) early so that preventative measures can be taken. A 
detailed analysis of the tissue structures from segmented MRI leads to a more 
accurate classification of specific brain disorders. Several segmentation 
methods to diagnose AD have been proposed with varying complexity. Segmentation 
of the brain structure and classification of AD using deep learning approaches 
has gained attention as it can provide effective results over a large set of 
data. Hence, deep learning methods are now preferred over state-of-the-art 
machine learning methods. We aim to provide an outline of current deep 
learning-based segmentation approaches for the quantitative analysis of brain 
MRI for the diagnosis of AD. Here, we report how convolutional neural network 
architectures are used to analyze the anatomical brain structure and diagnose 
AD, discuss how brain MRI segmentation improves AD classification, describe the 
state-of-the-art approaches, and summarize their results using publicly 
available datasets. Finally, we provide insight into current issues and discuss 
possible future research directions in building a computer-aided diagnostic 
system for AD.

OBJECTIVE: To propose a coupled convolutional and graph convolutional network 
(CCGCN) model for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage.
METHODS: The disease-related brain regions generated by group-wise comparison 
were used as the input. The convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used to 
extract disease-related features from different locations on brain magnetic 
resonance (MR) images. The generated features via the graph convolutional 
network (GCN) were processed, and graph pooling was performed to analyze the 
inherent relationship between the brain topology and the diagnosis task 
adaptively. Through ADNI dataset, we acquired the accuracy, sensitivity and 
specificity of the diagnosis tasks for AD and its prodromal stages, followed by 
an ablation study on the model structure.
RESULTS: The CCGCN model outperformed the current state-of-the-art methods and 
showed a classification accuracy of 92.5% for AD with a sensitivity of 88.1% and 
a specificity of 96.0%.
CONCLUSIONS: Based on the structural and topological features of the brain MR 
images, the proposed CCGCN model shows excellent performance in AD diagnosis and 
is expected to provide important assistance to physicians in disease diagnosis.

根据ADNI数据库提供的信息，将MMSE评分在20~26分、同时CDR评分为0.5或1的被试的疾病标签标记为AD组；将MMSE评分在24~30分且CDR评分为0、无抑郁症状、无认知障碍、无焦虑症状的被试疾病标签标记为NC组。本文提出一种耦合的卷积-图卷积神经网络（CCGCN）模型，以组间比较获取的疾病相关区域作为输入，利用卷积神经网络，从大脑磁共振图像的不同区域提取疾病相关的特征，再使用图卷积网络，结合提取到的特征，对区域间拓扑结构进行建模，并在图卷积网络中嵌入图池化操作，从而自适应地学习大脑拓扑结构与疾病诊断任务之间的内在联系。利用ADNI数据集，获得CCGCN模型对阿尔茨海默病及其前驱症状的疾病诊断准确率、灵敏度和特异度，并进行模型结构的消融实验。
结果: 
该模型在阿尔茨海默病的诊断任务上取得了92.5%的准确率、88.1%的灵敏度和96.0%的特异度，诊断精度优于目前最先进的方法；同时在区分进行型轻度认知障碍患者和稳定型轻度认知障碍患者的任务上取得了79.8%的准确率、55.3%的灵敏度和83.7%的特异度；消融实验的结果显示了CCGCN模型各组成成分的有效性。
结论: 
基于耦合的卷积-图卷积神经网络的疾病诊断模型利用了原始图像的结构和拓扑信息，相比现有方法可以提供更加精确的阿尔茨海默病诊断结果，有望将其应用于临床的辅助诊断中。

OBJECTIVE: Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that cerebrovascular 
disease and Alzheimer disease (AD) pathology frequently co-occur in older 
adults. The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression 
of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission 
tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well-validated measure of 
systemic vascular risk and β-amyloid (Aβ) burden have an interactive association 
with regional tau burden.
METHODS: Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older 
adults (mean age = 73.5 ± 6.1 years) with the office-based Framingham Heart 
Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS-CVD). We acquired Aβ (11 
C-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (18 F-flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same 
participants. Aβ PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 
2.98 ± 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early 
site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site 
of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models 
examined FHS-CVD and Aβ as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting 
for age, sex, APOE ε4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau 
PET scan.
RESULTS: We observed a significant interaction between FHS-CVD and Aβ burden on 
subsequently measured ITC tau (p < 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS-CVD and 
elevated Aβ burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not 
significant for EC tau (p = 0.16).
INTERPRETATION: Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled 
with high Aβ burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular 
risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD. Ann Neurol 2019; 1-8 ANN NEUROL

Stem cell transplantation therapies are currently under investigation for 
central nervous system disorders. Although preclinical models show benefit, 
clinical translation is somewhat limited by the absence of reliable noninvasive 
methods to confirm targeting and monitor transplanted cells in vivo. Here, we 
assess a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agent derived from 
magnetotactic bacteria, magneto-endosymbionts (MEs), as a translatable 
methodology for in vivo tracking of stem cells after intracranial 
transplantation. We show that ME labeling provides robust MRI contrast without 
impairment of cell viability or other important therapeutic features. Labeled 
cells were visualized immediately post-transplantation and over time by serial 
MRI in nonhuman primate and mouse brain. Postmortem tissue analysis confirmed 
on-target grft location, and linear correlations were observed between MRI 
signal, cell engraftment, and tissue ME levels, suggesting that MEs may be 
useful for determining graft survival or rejection. Overall, these findings 
indicate that MEs are an effective tool for in vivo tracking and monitoring of 
cell transplantation therapies with potential relevance to many cellular therapy 
applications.

BACKGROUND: In this study, we used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
classify Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and normal 
control (NC) subjects based on images of the hippocampus region extracted from 
magnetic resonance (MR) images of the brain.
METHODS: The datasets used in this study were obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). To segment the hippocampal region 
automatically, the patient brain MR images were matched to the International 
Consortium for Brain Mapping template (ICBM) using 3D-Slicer software. Using 
prior knowledge and anatomical annotation label information, the hippocampal 
region was automatically extracted from the brain MR images.
RESULTS: The area of the hippocampus in each image was preprocessed using local 
entropy minimization with a bi-cubic spline model (LEMS) by an inhomogeneity 
intensity correction method. To train the CNN model, we separated the dataset 
into three groups, namely AD/NC, AD/MCI, and MCI/NC. The prediction model 
achieved an accuracy of 92.3% for AD/NC, 85.6% for AD/MCI, and 78.1% for MCI/NC.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study were compared to those of previous 
studies, and summarized and analyzed to facilitate more flexible analyses based 
on additional experiments. The classification accuracy obtained by the proposed 
method is highly accurate. These findings suggest that this approach is 
efficient and may be a promising strategy to obtain good AD, MCI and NC 
classification performance using small patch images of hippocampus instead of 
whole slide images.

A mechanistic hypothesis for the impairment of synaptic plasticity by soluble Aβ 
oligomers from Alzheimer's brain.

It is increasingly accepted that early cognitive impairment in Alzheimer's 
disease results in considerable part from synaptic dysfunction caused by the 
accumulation of a range of oligomeric assemblies of amyloid β-protein (Aβ). Most 
studies have used synthetic Aβ peptides to explore the mechanisms of memory 
deficits in rodent models, but recent work suggests that Aβ assemblies isolated 
from human (AD) brain tissue are far more potent and disease-relevant. Although 
reductionist experiments show Aβ oligomers to impair synaptic plasticity and 
neuronal viability, the responsible mechanisms are only partly understood. 
Glutamatergic receptors, GABAergic receptors, nicotinic receptors, insulin 
receptors, the cellular prion protein, inflammatory mediators, and diverse 
signaling pathways have all been suggested. Studies using AD brain-derived 
soluble Aβ oligomers suggest that only certain bioactive forms (principally 
small, diffusible oligomers) can disrupt synaptic plasticity, including by 
binding to plasma membranes and changing excitatory-inhibitory balance, 
perturbing mGluR, PrP, and other neuronal surface proteins, down-regulating 
glutamate transporters, causing glutamate spillover, and activating 
extrasynaptic GluN2B-containing NMDA receptors. We synthesize these emerging 
data into a mechanistic hypothesis for synaptic failure in Alzheimer's disease 
that can be modified as new knowledge is added and specific therapeutics are 
developed.

OBJECTIVE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is characterized by the 
accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the walls of cortical vessels and the accrual 
of microbleeds and microinfarcts over time. The relationship between CAA 
severity and microbleeds and microinfarcts as well as the sequence of events 
that lead to lesion formation remain poorly understood.
METHODS: We scanned intact formalin-fixed hemispheres of 12 CAA cases with 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by histopathological examination in 
predefined areas and serial sectioning in targeted areas with multiple lesions.
RESULTS: In total, 1,168 cortical microbleeds and 472 cortical microinfarcts 
were observed on ex vivo MRI. Increasing CAA severity at the whole-brain or 
regional level was not associated with the number of microbleeds or 
microinfarcts. However, locally, the density of Aβ-positive cortical vessels was 
lower surrounding a microbleed compared to a simulated control lesion, and 
higher surrounding microinfarcts. Serial sectioning revealed that for (n = 28) 
microbleeds, both Aβ (4%) and smooth muscle cells (4%) were almost never present 
in the vessel wall at the site of bleeding, but Aβ was frequently observed 
upstream or downstream (71%), as was extensive fibrin(ogen) buildup (87%). In 
contrast, for (n = 22) microinfarcts, vascular Aβ was almost always observed at 
the core of the lesion (91%, p < 0.001) as well as upstream or downstream (82%), 
but few vessels associated with microinfarcts had intact smooth muscle cells 
(9%).
INTERPRETATION: These observations provide a model for how a single 
neuropathologic process such as CAA may result in hemorrhagic or ischemic brain 
lesions potentially through 2 different mechanistic pathways. ANN NEUROL

Alzheimer's disease (AD) may cause damage to the memory cells permanently, which 
results in the form of dementia. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease at an 
early stage is a problematic task for researchers. For this, machine learning 
and deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches are readily 
available to solve various problems related to brain image data analysis. In 
clinical research, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose AD. For 
accurate classification of dementia stages, we need highly discriminative 
features obtained from MRI images. Recently advanced deep CNN-based models 
successfully proved their accuracy. However, due to a smaller number of image 
samples available in the datasets, there exist problems of over-fitting 
hindering the performance of deep learning approaches. In this research, we 
developed a Siamese convolutional neural network (SCNN) model inspired by VGG-16 
(also called Oxford Net) to classify dementia stages. In our approach, we extend 
the insufficient and imbalanced data by using augmentation approaches. 
Experiments are performed on a publicly available dataset open access series of 
imaging studies (OASIS), by using the proposed approach, an excellent test 
accuracy of 99.05% is achieved for the classification of dementia stages. We 
compared our model with the state-of-the-art models and discovered that the 
proposed model outperformed the state-of-the-art models in terms of performance, 
efficiency, and accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Recent deep learning models have shown remarkable accuracy for the 
diagnostic classification. However, they have limitations in clinical 
application due to the gap between the training cohorts and real-world data. We 
aimed to develop a model trained only by normal brain PET data with an 
unsupervised manner to identify an abnormality in various disorders as imaging 
data of the clinical routine.
METHODS: Using variational autoencoder, a type of unsupervised learning, 
Abnormality Score was defined as how far a given brain image is from the normal 
data. The model was applied to FDG PET data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical routine FDG PET data for assessing 
behavioral abnormality and seizures. Accuracy was measured by the area under 
curve (AUC) of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. We investigated 
whether deep learning has additional benefits with experts' visual 
interpretation to identify abnormal patterns.
FINDINGS: The AUC of the ROC curve for differentiating AD was 0.90. The changes 
in cognitive scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up were significantly 
correlated with Abnormality Score at baseline. The AUC of the ROC curve for 
discriminating patients with various disorders from controls was 0.74. Experts' 
visual interpretation was helped by the deep learning model to identify abnormal 
patterns in 60% of cases initially not identified without the model.
INTERPRETATION: We suggest that deep learning model trained only by normal data 
was applicable for identifying wide-range of abnormalities in brain diseases, 
even uncommon ones, proposing its possible use for interpreting real-world 
clinical data.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the level of metabolites in magnetic resonance 
spectroscopy (MRS) is a representative marker of underlying pathological changes 
identified in positron emission tomographic (PET) images in Alzheimer disease 
(AD).
METHODS: We performed PET-guided MRS in cases of probable AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). All participants were imaged by 11 
C-Pittsburgh compound B (11 C-PiB) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18 F-FDG) PET 
followed by 3T MRS. PET images were assessed both visually and using 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). MRS voxels were placed in regions with 
maximum abnormality on amyloid (Aβ+) and FDG (hypometabolic) areas on PET scans. 
Corresponding normal areas were selected in controls. The ratios of total 
N-acetyl (tNA) group, myoinositol (mI), choline, and glutamate + glutamine over 
creatine (Cr) were compared between these regions.
RESULTS: Aβ + regions had significantly higher (p = 0.02) mI/Cr and lower tNA/Cr 
(p = 0.02), whereas in hypometabolic areas only tNA/Cr was reduced (p = 0.003). 
Multiple regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, and education showed mI/Cr 
was only associated with 11 C-PiB SUVR (p < 0.0001). tNA/Cr, however, was 
associated with both PiB (p = 0.0003) and 18 F-FDG SUVR (p = 0.006). The level 
of mI/Cr was not significantly different between MCI and AD (p = 0.28), but 
tNA/Cr showed significant decline from HC to MCI to AD (p = 0.001, p = 0.04).
INTERPRETATION: mI/Cr has significant temporal and spatial associations with Aβ 
and could potentially be considered as a disease state biomarker. tNA is an 
indicator of early neurodegenerative changes and might have a role as disease 
stage biomarker and also as a valuable surrogate marker for treatment response.

Machine learning-based imaging diagnostics has recently reached or even 
surpassed the level of clinical experts in several clinical domains. However, 
classification decisions of a trained machine learning system are typically 
non-transparent, a major hindrance for clinical integration, error tracking or 
knowledge discovery. In this study, we present a transparent deep learning 
framework relying on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise 
relevance propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), the most 
widespread autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease. MS is commonly diagnosed 
utilizing a combination of clinical presentation and conventional magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), specifically the occurrence and presentation of white 
matter lesions in T2-weighted images. We hypothesized that using LRP in a naive 
predictive model would enable us to uncover relevant image features that a 
trained CNN uses for decision-making. Since imaging markers in MS are 
well-established this would enable us to validate the respective CNN model. 
First, we pre-trained a CNN on MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 921), afterwards specializing the CNN to 
discriminate between MS patients (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 71). Using 
LRP, we then produced a heatmap for each subject in the holdout set depicting 
the voxel-wise relevance for a particular classification decision. The resulting 
CNN model resulted in a balanced accuracy of 87.04% and an area under the curve 
of 96.08% in a receiver operating characteristic curve. The subsequent LRP 
visualization revealed that the CNN model focuses indeed on individual lesions, 
but also incorporates additional information such as lesion location, 
non-lesional white matter or gray matter areas such as the thalamus, which are 
established conventional and advanced MRI markers in MS. We conclude that LRP 
and the proposed framework have the capability to make diagnostic decisions of 
CNN models transparent, which could serve to justify classification decisions 
for clinical review, verify diagnosis-relevant features and potentially gather 
new disease knowledge.

We examined if plasma phosphorylated tau is associated with neurodegeneration in 
Alzheimer's disease. We investigated 372 cognitively unimpaired participants, 
554 mild cognitive impairment patients, and 141 Alzheimer's disease dementia 
patients. Tau phosphorylated at threonine 181, regional cortical thickness 
(using magnetic resonance imaging) and hypometabolism (using fluorodeoxyglucose 
positron emission tomography) were measured longitudinally. High plasma tau was 
associated with hypometabolism and cortical atrophy at baseline and over time, 
and longitudinally increased tau was associated with accelerated atrophy, but 
these associations were only observed in Aβ-positive participants. Plasma 
phosphorylated tau may identify and track processes linked to neurodegeneration 
in Alzheimer's disease.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. 
In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to 
artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse 
modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this 
task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to 
integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET 
images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the 
traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually 
extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn 
features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the 
proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images 
in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) 
subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive 
impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment 
(pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for 
CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework 
yields a state-of-the-art performance. Finally, the results have demonstrated 
that (1) segmentation is not a prerequisite when using a CNN for the 
classification, (2) the combination of two modality imaging data generates 
better results.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediary stage condition between 
healthy people and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and other dementias. AD is 
a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, which is a 
significant threat to people, age 65 and older. Although MCI does not always 
lead to AD, an early diagnosis at the stage of MCI can be very helpful in 
identifying people who are at risk of AD. Moreover, the early diagnosis of MCI 
can lead to more effective treatment, or at least, significantly delay the 
disease's progress, and can lead to social and financial benefits. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), which has become a significant tool for the diagnosis 
of MCI and AD, can provide neuropsychological data for analyzing the variance in 
brain structure and function. MCI is divided into early and late MCI (EMCI and 
LMCI) and sadly, there is no clear differentiation between the brain structure 
of healthy people and MCI patients, especially in the EMCI stage. This paper 
aims to use a deep learning approach, which is one of the most powerful branches 
of machine learning, to discriminate between healthy people and the two types of 
MCI groups based on MRI results. The convolutional neural network (CNN) with an 
efficient architecture was used to extract high-quality features from MRIs to 
classify people into healthy, EMCI, or LMCI groups. The MRIs of 600 individuals 
used in this study included 200 control normal (CN) people, 200 EMCI patients, 
and 200 LMCI patients. This study randomly selected 70 percent of the data to 
train our model and 30 percent for the test set. The results showed the best 
overall classification between CN and LMCI groups in the sagittal view with an 
accuracy of 94.54 percent. In addition, 93.96 percent and 93.00 percent accuracy 
were reached for the pairs of EMCI/LMCI and CN/EMCI, respectively.

Alzheimer's is a disease for which there is no cure. Diagnosing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) early facilitates family planning and cost control. The purpose of 
this study is to predict the presence of AD using socio-demographic, clinical, 
and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Early detection of AD enables family 
planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery 
methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 
(OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine 
(GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age, education, 
socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE). A residual 
network with 50 layers (ResNet-50) predicted the clinical dementia rating (CDR) 
presence and severity from MRI's (multi-class classification). The GBM achieved 
a mean 91.3% prediction accuracy (10-fold stratified cross validation) for 
dichotomous CDR using socio-demographic and MMSE variables. MMSE was the most 
important feature. ResNet-50 using image generation techniques based on an 80% 
training set resulted in 98.99% three class prediction accuracy on 4139 images 
(20% validation set) at Epoch 133 and nearly perfect multi-class predication 
accuracy on the training set (99.34%). Machine learning methods classify AD with 
high accuracy. GBM models may help provide initial detection based on 
non-imagery analysis, while ResNet-50 network models might help identify AD 
patients automatically prior to provider review.

Segmentation of the hippocampus (HC) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an 
essential step for diagnosis and monitoring of several clinical situations such 
as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and epilepsy. Automatic segmentation 
of HC structures is challenging due to their small volume, complex shape, low 
contrast and discontinuous boundaries. The active contour model (ACM) with a 
statistical shape prior is robust. However, it is difficult to build a shape 
prior that is general enough to cover all possible shapes of the HC and that 
suffers the problems of complicated registration of the shape prior and the 
target object and of low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic 
model that combines a deep belief network (DBN) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) 
method for the segmentation of HC. The training process of DBN consists of 
unsupervised bottom-up training and supervised training of a top restricted 
Boltzmann machine (RBM). Given an input image, the trained DBN is utilized to 
infer the patient-specific shape prior of the HC. The specific shape prior is 
not only used to determine the initial contour, but is also introduced into the 
LB model as part of the external force to refine the segmentation. We used a 
subset of OASIS-1 as the training set and the preliminary release of EADC-ADNI 
as the testing set. The segmentation results of our method have good correlation 
and consistency with the manual segmentation results.

Anatomical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), diffusion MRI and resting state 
functional MRI (rs-fMRI) have been used for Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
classification. These scans are typically used to build models for 
discriminating AD patients from control subjects, but it is not clear if these 
models can also discriminate AD in diverse clinical populations as found in 
memory clinics. To study this, we trained MRI-based AD classification models on 
a single centre data set consisting of AD patients (N = 76) and controls 
(N = 173), and used these models to assign AD scores to subjective memory 
complainers (N = 67), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (N = 61), and AD 
patients (N = 61) from a multi-centre memory clinic data set. The anatomical MRI 
scans were used to calculate grey matter density, subcortical volumes and 
cortical thickness, the diffusion MRI scans were used to calculate fractional 
anisotropy, mean, axial and radial diffusivity, and the rs-fMRI scans were used 
to calculate functional connectivity between resting state networks and 
amplitude of low frequency fluctuations. Within the multi-centre memory clinic 
data set we removed scan site differences prior to applying the models. For all 
models, on average, the AD patients were assigned the highest AD scores, 
followed by MCI patients, and later followed by SMC subjects. The anatomical MRI 
models performed best, and the best performing anatomical MRI measure was grey 
matter density, separating SMC subjects from MCI patients with an AUC of 0.69, 
MCI patients from AD patients with an AUC of 0.70, and SMC patients from AD 
patients with an AUC of 0.86. The diffusion MRI models did not generalise well 
to the memory clinic data, possibly because of large scan site differences. The 
functional connectivity model separated SMC subjects and MCI patients relatively 
good (AUC = 0.66). The multimodal MRI model did not improve upon the anatomical 
MRI model. In conclusion, we showed that the grey matter density model 
generalises best to memory clinic subjects. When also considering the fact that 
grey matter density generally performs well in AD classification studies, this 
feature is probably the best MRI-based feature for AD diagnosis in clinical 
practice.

Recently, deep-learning-based approaches have been proposed for the 
classification of neuroimaging data related to Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 
significant progress has been made. However, end-to-end learning that is capable 
of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to receive much attention due 
to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, 
this study presents an approach meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a 
volumetric convolutional neural network (CNN) model for four binary 
classification tasks (AD vs. normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive 
impairment (pMCI) vs. NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and 
pMCI vs. sMCI) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its 
outcomes in terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In 
the proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based unsupervised 
learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and supervised transfer learning 
is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI classification task. To detect the most 
important biomarkers related to AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization 
method that approximates the spatial influence of the CNN model's decision was 
applied. To validate the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments 
on the ADNI database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach 
achieved the accuracies of 86.60% and 73.95% for the AD and pMCI classification 
tasks respectively, outperforming other network models. In the visualization 
results, the temporal and parietal lobes were identified as key regions for 
classification.

Early identification of individuals at risk of developing Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) dementia is important for developing disease-modifying therapies. In this 
study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical diagnosis of an individual from 
one or more timepoints, we seek to predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and 
ventricular volume of the individual for every month (indefinitely) into the 
future. We proposed and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) 
model to data from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution 
(TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants 
(Marinescu et al., 2018) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model and four baseline 
algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most previous work on predicting AD 
progression ignore the issue of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in 
longitudinal data. Here, we explored three different strategies to handle 
missing data. Two of the strategies treated the missing data as a 
"preprocessing" issue, by imputing the missing data using the previous timepoint 
("forward filling") or linear interpolation ("linear filling). The third 
strategy utilized the minimalRNN model itself to fill in the missing data both 
during training and testing ("model filling"). Our analyses suggest that the 
minimalRNN with "model filling" compared favorably with baseline algorithms, 
including support vector machine/regression, linear state space (LSS) model, and 
long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly, although the training 
procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found that the trained minimalRNN model 
exhibited similar performance, when using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input 
timepoints, suggesting that our approach might work well with just 
cross-sectional data. An earlier version of our approach was ranked 5th (out of 
53 entries) in the TADPOLE challenge in 2019. The current approach is ranked 2nd 
out of 63 entries as of June 3rd, 2020.

White matter abnormalities, revealed by Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), are 
observed in patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD), representing neural network 
deficits that underlie gradual cognitive decline in patients. However, how DTI 
changes related to the development of Amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau pathology, two 
key hallmarks of AD, remain elusive. We hypothesized that tauopathy induced by 
Aβ could initiate an axonal degeneration, leading to DTI-detectable white matter 
abnormalities. We utilized the visual system of the transgenic p301L tau mice as 
a model system. Aβ was injected in Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), where the 
Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) axons terminate. Longitudinal DTI was conducted to 
detect changes in the optic tract (OT) and optic nerve (ON), containing the 
distal and proximal segments of RGC axons, respectively. Our results showed DTI 
changes in OT (significant 13.2% reduction in axial diffusion, AxD vs. vehicle 
controls) followed by significant alterations in ON AxD and fractional 
anisotropy, FA. Histology data revealed loss of synapses, RGC axons and cell 
bodies resulting from the Aβ injection. We further tested whether 
microtubule-stabilizing compound Epothilone D (EpoD) could ameliorate the 
damage. EpoD co-treatment with Aβ was sufficient to prevent Aβ-induced axon and 
cell loss. Using an acute injection paradigm, our data suggest that EpoD may 
mediate its protective effect by blocking localized, acute Aβ-induced tau 
phosphorylation. This study demonstrates white matter disruption resulting from 
localized Aβ, the importance of tau pathology induction to changes in white 
matter connectivity, and the use of EpoD as a potential therapeutic avenue to 
prevent the axon loss in AD.

IMPORTANCE: Oligomeric amyloid-β peptide binds to cellular prion protein on the 
neuronal cell surface, activating intracellular fyn kinase to mediate 
synaptotoxicity and tauopathy. AZD0530 is an investigational kinase inhibitor 
specific for the Src family, including fyn, that has been repurposed for the 
treatment of Alzheimer disease.
OBJECTIVE: To determine whether AZD0530 treatment slows the decline in cerebral 
metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and is safe and well tolerated.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This multicenter phase 2a randomized clinical 
trial enrolled participants between December 23, 2014, and November 30, 2016. 
Participants (n = 159) had mild Alzheimer dementia and positron emission 
tomography (PET) evidence of elevated levels of amyloid-β peptide. Efficacy 
analyses of all primary and secondary outcomes were conducted in a modified 
intention-to-treat population. Final analyses were conducted from February 9, 
2018, to July 25, 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: AZD0530 (100 mg or 125 mg daily) vs placebo for 52 weeks.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcome was the reduction in relative CMRgl, 
as measured by 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, at 52 weeks in an Alzheimer 
disease-associated prespecified statistical region of interest. Secondary end 
points included change in cognition, function, and other biomarkers.
RESULTS: Among the 159 participants, 79 were randomized to receive AZD0530 and 
80 to receive placebo. Of the 159 participants, 87 (54.7%) were male, with a 
mean (SD) age of 71.0 (7.7) years. Based on a week-2 plasma drug level 
(target = 180 ng/mL; 30nM free), 15 participants (19.2%) had their AZD0530 dose 
escalated from 100 mg to 125 mg. Mean plasma levels from weeks 13 to 52 were 220 
ng/mL and 36nM free. More participants discontinued treatment with AZD0530 than 
with placebo (21 vs 11), most commonly because of adverse events. The most 
frequent adverse events were gastrointestinal disorders (primarily diarrhea), 
which occurred in 38 participants (48.1%) who received AZD0530 and in 23 (28.8%) 
who received placebo. In the primary outcome, the treatment groups did not 
differ in 52-week decline in relative CMRgl (mean difference: -0.006 units/y; 
95% CI, -0.017 to 0.006; P = .34). The treatment groups also did not differ in 
the rate of change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale, 
Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study-Activities of Daily Living, Clinical 
Dementia Rating, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, or Mini-Mental State Examination 
scores. Secondary volumetric magnetic resonance imaging analyses revealed no 
treatment effect on total brain or ventricular volume but did show trends for 
slowing the reduction in hippocampal volume and entorhinal thickness.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Statistically significant effects of AZD530 treatment 
were not found on relative CMRgl reduction in an Alzheimer disease-associated 
region of interest or on secondary clinical or biomarker measures.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a typical neurodegenerative disease, which is 
clinically manifested as amnesia, loss of language ability and self-care 
ability, and so on. So far, the cause of the disease has still been unclear and 
the course of the disease is irreversible, and there has been no cure for the 
disease yet. Hence, early prognosis of AD is important for the development of 
new drugs and measures to slow the progression of the disease. Mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) is a state between AD and healthy controls (HC). Studies have 
shown that patients with MCI are more likely to develop AD than those without 
MCI. Therefore, accurate screening of MCI patients has become one of the 
research hotspots of early prognosis of AD. With the rapid development of 
neuroimaging techniques and deep learning, more and more researchers employ deep 
learning methods to analyze brain neuroimaging images, such as magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), for early prognosis of AD. Hence, in this paper, a 
three-dimensional multi-slice classifiers ensemble based on convolutional neural 
network (CNN) and ensemble learning for early prognosis of AD has been proposed. 
Compared with the CNN classification model based on a single slice, the proposed 
classifiers ensemble based on multiple two-dimensional slices from three 
dimensions could use more effective information contained in MRI to improve 
classification accuracy and stability in a parallel computing mode.

Publisher: 阿尔茨海默症（AD）是一种典型的神经退行性疾病，临床上表现为失忆、丧失语言能力、丧失生活自理能力等。迄今为止，AD 
病因尚不明确且病程不可逆，也没有治愈的方法，因此，AD 的早期诊断对于研发新型药物和措施以减缓病情发展具有重要意义。轻度认知障碍（MCI）是一种介于 AD 
和正常老化（HC）之间的状态。研究表明，MCI 患者比没有患过 MCI 的人更有可能发展成 AD，因此，对 MCI 患者的准确筛查成为了 AD 
早期诊断的研究热点之一。随着神经影像技术和深度学习的飞速发展，越来越多的研究者使用深度学习方法对大脑神经影像如磁共振影像（MRI）进行分析，用于 AD 
的早期诊断。于是，本文提出基于卷积神经网络（CNN）和集成学习的多切片集成分类模型用于 AD 早期诊断。与只用单切片训练获得的 CNN 
分类模型相比，本文采用三个维度上的多个二维切片进行训练而获得的集成分类器模型，能更充分地利用 MRI 包含的有效信息，从而提高分类的准确率和稳定性。.

Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays important role 
for patient care and development of future treatment. Structural and functional 
neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission 
tomography (PET), are providing powerful imaging modalities to help understand 
the anatomical and functional neural changes related to AD. In recent years, 
machine learning methods have been widely studied on analysis of multi-modality 
neuroimages for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of 
AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft imaging features after image 
preprocessing such as registration and segmentation, and then train a classifier 
to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. This paper proposes to construct 
cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the multi-level and 
multimodal features of MRI and PET brain images for AD classification. First, 
multiple deep 3D-CNNs are constructed on different local image patches to 
transform the local brain image into more compact high-level features. Then, an 
upper high-level 2D-CNN followed by softmax layer is cascaded to ensemble the 
high-level features learned from the multi-modality and generate the latent 
multimodal correlation features of the corresponding image patches for 
classification task. Finally, these learned features are combined by a fully 
connected layer followed by softmax layer for AD classification. The proposed 
method can automatically learn the generic multi-level and multimodal features 
from multiple imaging modalities for classification, which are robust to the 
scale and rotation variations to some extent. No image segmentation and rigid 
registration are required in pre-processing the brain images. Our method is 
evaluated on the baseline MRI and PET images of 397 subjects including 93 AD 
patients, 204 mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 76 pMCI +128 sMCI) and 100 normal 
controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. 
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 
93.26% for classification of AD vs. NC and 82.95% for classification pMCI vs. 
NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance.

Weakly Supervised Deep Learning for Brain Disease Prognosis Using MRI and 
Incomplete Clinical Scores.

Liu M, Zhang J, Lian C, Shen D.

As a hot topic in brain disease prognosis, predicting clinical measures of 
subjects based on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data helps to assess 
the stage of pathology and predict future development of the disease. Due to 
incomplete clinical labels/scores, previous learning-based studies often simply 
discard subjects without ground-truth scores. This would result in limited 
training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods 
focus only on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue 
volume) of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with 
prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised densely 
connected neural network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline 
MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract 
multiscale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from MRI to capture 
local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly 
supervised densely connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging 
features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss 
function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even 
those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training. 
The experimental results on 1469 subjects from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets 
demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently predict future clinical 
measures of subjects.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Automatic diagnosis of MCI by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images has been 
the focus of research in recent years. Furthermore, deep learning models based 
on 2D view and 3D view have been widely used in the diagnosis of MCI. The deep 
learning architecture can capture anatomical changes in the brain from MRI scans 
to extract the underlying features of brain disease. In this paper, we propose a 
multi-view based multi-model (MVMM) learning framework, which effectively 
combines the local information of 2D images with the global information of 3D 
images. First, we select some 2D slices from MRI images and extract the features 
representing 2D local information. Then, we combine them with the features 
representing 3D global information learned from 3D images to train the MVMM 
learning framework. We evaluate our model on the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results show that our 
proposed model can effectively recognize MCI through MRI images (accuracy of 
87.50% for MCI/HC and accuracy of 83.18% for MCI/AD).

OBJECTIVE: In the 2018 ATN framework, Alzheimer's neurodegenerative biomarkers 
comprised cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) total tau, 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron 
emission tomography, and brain atrophy. We aimed to assess the clinical outcomes 
of having discordant Alzheimer's neurodegenerative biomarkers.
METHODS: A total of 721 non-demented individuals from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database were included and then further categorized into 
concordant-negative, discordant, and concordant-positive groups. Demographic 
distributions of the groups were compared. Longitudinal changes in clinical 
outcomes and risk of conversion were assessed using linear mixed-effects models 
and multivariate Cox proportional hazard models, respectively.
RESULTS: Discordant group was intermediate to concordant-negative and 
concordant-positive groups in terms of APOE ε4 positivity, CSF amyloid-beta, and 
phosphorylated tau. Compared with concordant-negative group, discordant group 
deteriorated faster in cognitive scores (Mini-Mental State Examination, the 
Clinical Dementia Rating Scale-Sum of Boxes, and the Functional Activities 
Questionnaire) and demonstrated greater rates of atrophy in brain structures 
(hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and whole brain), and concordant-positive group 
performed worse over time than discordant group. Moreover, the risk of cognitive 
decline increased from concordant-negative to discordant to concordant-positive. 
The results from longitudinal analyses were validated in A+T+, cognitively 
normal, and mild cognitive impairment individuals, and were also validated by 
applying different cutoffs and neurodegenerative biomarkers.
INTERPRETATION: Discordant neurodegenerative status denotes a stage of cognitive 
function which is intermediate between concordant-negative and 
concordant-positive. Identification of discordant cases would provide insights 
into intervention and new therapy approaches, particularly in A+T+ individuals. 
Moreover, this work may be a complement to the ATN scheme.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate β-amyloid and tau depositions using Pittsburgh 
compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography (PET) and AV1451 tau PET imaging 
in aging multiple sclerosis (MS) patients.
METHODS: Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, 
and APOE ε4 status from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who 
underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with 
MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and 
AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and 
previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same 
population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations 
with age.
RESULTS: AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 
0.52 [0.27-0.98], p = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95% CI] = 0.52 
[0.28-0.99], p = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95% CI] = 
0.10 [0.01-0.90], p = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although 
AD-signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the 
groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95% CI] = 10.65 
[1.10-103.35], p = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature 
PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS 
(estimate [95% CI] = -0.14 [-0.023 to -0.006], p = 0.002). Similarly, the 
association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls 
compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = -0.13 [-0.021 to -0.005], p 
= 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings 
with age between the MS patients and controls.
INTERPRETATION: Although both β-amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive 
aging and AD, cortical β-amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age-matched 
controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the 
accumulation of β-amyloid but not the accumulation of tau. ANN NEUROL

Due to both the hidden nature and the irreversibility of Alzheimers disease 
(AD), it has become the killer of the elderly and is thus the focus of much 
attention in the medical field. Radiologists compare the predicted brain age 
with the ground truth in order to provide a preliminary analysis of AD, which 
helps doctors diagnose AD as early in its development as possible. In this 
paper, a transfer learning-based method of predicting brain age using MR images 
and dataset of a public brain was proposed. In order to get the best transfer 
results, we froze different layers and only fine-tuned the remaining layers. We 
used three planes of brain MR images together to predict age for the first time 
and experiment results showed that the proposed method performs better than the 
state-of-the-art method under mean absolute error metric by 0.6 years. In 
addition, to explore the relationship between brain MR images of different 
planes and predicted age accuracy, we used three different planes of brain MR 
images to predict age respectively for the first time and found that sagittal 
plane MR images outperformed two other planes in age estimation. Finally, our 
research identified, the effective regions that contribute to brain age 
estimation for cognitively normal individuals and for AD patients with deep 
learning. For AD patients, the effective region is mainly concentrated in the 
frontal lobe of the brain, verifying the relevant medical conclusions about AD.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether a unified brain system manages one's 
orientation to different places, events and people in one's environment, and 
test the hypothesis that failure of this system (disorientation) is an early 
sign of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A total of 46 participants (patients along the AD continuum and 
cognitively normal control subjects) were tested in a personalized, ecologically 
valid task of orientation relating to the participant's own world in space, time 
and person under high-density electroencephalography. As a first step, we used 
evoked potential mapping to search for brain topography correlated with 
participants' performance in orientating themselves to different places (space), 
events (time) and people (person) (Experiment 1). We then compared behavioral 
and electrophysiological changes in patients along the AD continuum (Experiment 
2).
RESULTS: We identified a specific brain topography ("orientation map") that was 
active for orientation in space, time and person in correlation to participants' 
performance. Both performance and the map's strength gradually decreased from 
health to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and from MCI to AD. Another map, 
immediately preceding the orientation map, showed the longest activity in 
patients with MCI, significantly more than both patients with AD and cognitively 
normal controls.
INTERPRETATION: Our findings demonstrate that the same brain topography accounts 
for orientation in the different domains of space, time and person and provide a 
nexus between deterioration in patients' orientation with the aggravation of 
Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is associated with complex changes in 
eating behavior and metabolism, which potentially affect disease pathogenesis 
and survival. It is currently not known if body composition changes and changes 
in fat deposition also exist in FTD, the relationship of these changes in eating 
behavior and appetite, and whether these changes are centrally mediated.
METHODS: Body composition was measured in 28 people with behavioral-variant 
frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 16 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 
healthy controls, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Changes in body 
composition were correlated to brain grey matter atrophy using voxel-based 
morphometry on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Behavioral-variant FTD was characterized by changes in body 
composition, with increased total fat mass, visceral adipose tissue area (VAT 
area), and android: gynoid ratio compared to control and AD participants (all P 
values < 0.05). Changes in body composition correlated to abnormal eating 
behavior and behavioral change (P < 0.01) and functional decline (P < 0.01). 
Changes in body composition also correlated to grey matter atrophy involving a 
distributed neural network that included the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus 
accumbens, insula, cingulate, and cerebellum - structures known to be central to 
autonomic control - as well as the thalamus, putamen, accumbens, and caudate, 
which are involved in reward processing.
CONCLUSIONS: Changes in body composition and fat deposition extend the clinical 
phenomenology in bvFTD beyond cognition and behavior, with changes associated 
with changes in reward and autonomic processing suggesting that these deficits 
may be central in FTD.

Attention-Guided Hybrid Network for Dementia Diagnosis With Structural MR 
Images.

Lian C, Liu M, Pan Y, Shen D.

Deep-learning methods (especially convolutional neural networks) using 
structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data have been successfully applied 
to computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal 
stage [i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI)]. As it is practically challenging 
to capture local and subtle disease-associated abnormalities directly from the 
whole-brain sMRI, most of those deep-learning approaches empirically preselect 
disease-associated sMRI brain regions for model construction. Considering that 
such isolated selection of potentially informative brain locations might be 
suboptimal, very few methods have been proposed to perform disease-associated 
discriminative region localization and disease diagnosis in a unified 
deep-learning framework. However, those methods based on task-oriented 
discriminative localization still suffer from two common limitations, that is: 
1) identified brain locations are strictly consistent across all subjects, which 
ignores the unique anatomical characteristics of each brain and 2) only limited 
local regions/patches are used for model training, which does not fully utilize 
the global structural information provided by the whole-brain sMRI. In this 
article, we propose an attention-guided deep-learning framework to extract 
multilevel discriminative sMRI features for dementia diagnosis. Specifically, we 
first design a backbone fully convolutional network to automatically localize 
the discriminative brain regions in a weakly supervised manner. Using the 
identified disease-related regions as spatial attention guidance, we further 
develop a hybrid network to jointly learn and fuse multilevel sMRI features for 
CAD model construction. Our proposed method was evaluated on three public 
datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and AIBL), showing superior performance compared 
with several state-of-the-art methods in both tasks of AD diagnosis and MCI 
conversion prediction.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder worldwide 
and is one of the leading sources of morbidity and mortality in the aging 
population. There is a long preclinical period followed by mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). Clinical diagnosis and the rate of decline is variable. 
Progression monitoring remains a challenge in AD, and it is imperative to create 
better tools to quantify this progression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) is commonly used for patient assessment. However, current approaches for 
analysis require strong a priori assumptions about regions of interest used and 
complex preprocessing pipelines including computationally expensive non-linear 
registrations and iterative surface deformations. These preprocessing steps are 
composed of many stacked processing layers. Any error or bias in an upstream 
layer will be propagated throughout the pipeline. Failures or biases in the 
non-linear subject registration and the subjective choice of atlases of specific 
regions are common in medical neuroimaging analysis and may hinder the 
translation of many approaches to the clinical practice. Here we propose a 
data-driven method based on an extension of a deep learning architecture, 
DeepSymNet, that identifies longitudinal changes without relying on prior brain 
regions of interest, an atlas, or non-linear registration steps. Our approach is 
trained end-to-end and learns how a patient's brain structure dynamically 
changes between two-time points directly from the raw voxels. We compare our 
approach with Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines and voxel-based methods using 
the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model can 
identify AD progression with comparable results to existing Freesurfer 
longitudinal pipelines without the need of predefined regions of interest, 
non-rigid registration algorithms, or iterative surface deformation at a 
fraction of the processing time. When compared to other voxel-based methods 
which share some of the same benefits, our model showed a statistically 
significant performance improvement. Additionally, we show that our model can 
differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with MCI. The model's 
decision was investigated using the epsilon layer-wise propagation algorithm. We 
found that the predictions were driven by the pallidum, putamen, and the 
superior temporal gyrus. Our novel longitudinal based, deep learning approach 
has the potential to diagnose patients earlier and enable new computational 
tools to monitor neurodegeneration in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND: Memory for music has attracted much recent interest in Alzheimer's 
disease but the underlying brain mechanisms have not been defined in patients 
directly. Here we addressed this issue in an Alzheimer's disease cohort using 
activation fMRI of two core musical memory systems.
METHODS: We studied 34 patients with younger onset Alzheimer's disease led 
either by episodic memory decline (typical Alzheimer's disease) or by 
visuospatial impairment (posterior cortical atrophy) in relation to 19 
age-matched healthy individuals. We designed a novel fMRI paradigm based on 
passive listening to melodies that were either previously familiar or unfamiliar 
(musical semantic memory) and either presented singly or repeated (incidental 
musical episodic memory).
RESULTS: Both syndromic groups showed significant functional neuroanatomical 
alterations relative to the healthy control group. For musical semantic memory, 
disease-associated activation group differences were localised to right inferior 
frontal cortex (reduced activation in the group with memory-led Alzheimer's 
disease); while for incidental musical episodic memory, disease-associated 
activation group differences were localised to precuneus and posterior cingulate 
cortex (abnormally enhanced activation in the syndromic groups). In post-scan 
behavioural testing, both patient groups had a deficit of musical episodic 
memory relative to healthy controls whereas musical semantic memory was 
unimpaired.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings define functional neuroanatomical substrates for the 
differential involvement of musical semantic and incidental episodic memory in 
major phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. The complex dynamic profile of brain 
activation group differences observed suggests that musical memory may be an 
informative probe of neural network function in Alzheimer's disease. These 
findings may guide the development of future musical interventions in dementia.

OBJECTIVE: To determine if PET-based stages of regional amyloid deposition are 
associated with neuropathological phases of Aβ pathology.
METHODS: We applied data-driven regional frequency-based and a-priori 
striatum-based PET staging approaches to ante-mortem 18F-Florbetapir-PET scans 
of 30 cases from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative autopsy cohort, 
and used Bayesian regression analysis to study the associations of these in vivo 
amyloid stages with neuropathological Thal phases of regional Aβ plaque 
distribution and with semi-quantitative ratings of neocortical and striatal 
plaque densities.
RESULTS: Bayesian regression revealed extreme evidence for an association of 
both PET-based staging approaches with Thal phases, and these associations were 
about 44 times more likely for frequency-based stages and 89 times more likely 
for striatum-based stages than for global cortical 18F-Florbetapir-PET signal. 
Early (i.e., neocortical-only) PET-based amyloid stages also predicted the 
absence of striatal/diencephalic cored plaques. Receiver operating 
characteristics curves revealed highly accurate discrimination between low/high 
Thal phases and the presence/absence of regional plaques. The median areas under 
the curve were 0.99 for frequency-based staging (95% credibility interval 
0.97-1.00), 0.93 for striatum-based staging (0.83-1.00), and 0.87 for global 
18F-Florbetapir-PET signal (0.72-0.98).
INTERPRETATION: Our data indicate that both regional frequency- and 
striatum-based amyloid-PET staging approaches were superior to standard global 
amyloid-PET signal for differentiating between low and high degrees of regional 
amyloid pathology spread. Despite this, we found no evidence for the ability of 
either staging scheme to differentiate between low and moderate degrees of 
amyloid pathology which may be particularly relevant for early, preclinical 
stages of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative 
disorder after Alzheimer's disease; however, to date, there is no approved 
treatment that stops or slows down disease progression. Over the past decades, 
neuroimaging studies, including molecular imaging and MRI are trying to provide 
insights into the mechanisms underlying PD.
METHODS: This work utilized a literature review.
RESULTS: It is now becoming clear that these imaging modalities can provide 
biomarkers that can objectively detect brain changes related to PD and monitor 
these changes as the disease progresses, and these biomarkers are required to 
establish a breakthrough in neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapeutics.
CONCLUSIONS: Here, we provide a review of recent observations deriving from PET, 
single-positron emission tomography, and MRI studies exploring PD and other 
parkinsonian disorders.

Antemortem tau positron emission tomography imaging suggests elevated tau 
pathology in autosomal dominant versus late-onset Alzheimer's disease at 
equivalent clinical stages, but does not implicate the specific tau pathologies 
responsible. Here we made stereological measurements of tau neurofibrillary 
tangles, neuritic plaques, and neuropil threads and found compared to late-onset 
Alzheimer's disease, autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease showed even greater 
tangle and thread burdens. Regional tau burden resembled that observed in tau 
imaging of a separate cohort at earlier clinical stages. Finally, our results 
suggest tau imaging measures total tau burden in Alzheimer's disease, composed 
predominantly of tangle and thread pathology.

Detection and classification methods have a vital and important role in 
identifying brain diseases. Timely detection and classification of brain 
diseases enable an accurate identification and effective management of brain 
impairment. Brain disorders are commonly most spreadable diseases and the 
diagnosing process is time-consuming and highly expensive. There is an utmost 
need to develop effective and advantageous methods for brain diseases detection 
and characterization. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography 
(CT), and other various brain imaging scans are used to identify different brain 
diseases and disorders. Brain imaging scans are the efficient tool to understand 
the anatomical changes in brain in fast and accurate manner. These different 
brain imaging scans used with segmentation techniques and along with machine 
learning and deep learning techniques give maximum accuracy and efficiency. This 
paper focuses on different conventional approaches, machine learning and deep 
learning techniques used for the detection, and classification of brain diseases 
and abnormalities. This paper also summarizes the research gap and problems in 
the existing techniques used for detection and classification of brain 
disorders. Comparison and evaluation of different machine learning and deep 
learning techniques in terms of efficiency and accuracy are also highlighted in 
this paper. Furthermore, different brain diseases like leukoariaosis, 
Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Wilson's disorder are studied in the scope of 
machine learning and deep learning techniques.

OBJECTIVE: Visual evaluation is the standard for amyloid positron emission 
tomography (PET) examination, though the result depends upon the physician's 
subjective review of the images. Therefore, it is expected that objective 
quantitative evaluation is useful for image interpretation. In this study, we 
examined the usefulness of the quantitative evaluation of amyloid PET using a 
PET-only quantification method in comparison with visual evaluation.
METHODS: In this study we retrospectively investigated a total of 166 
individuals, including 58 cognitively normal controls, 62 individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment, and 46 individuals with early Alzheimer's disease. They 
underwent 11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET examination through the Japanese 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (J-ADNI). Amyloid accumulation in 
cerebral cortices was assessed using visual and quantitative methods. The 
quantitative evaluation was performed using the adaptive template method and 
empirically PiB-prone region of interest, and the standardized uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) in each area was obtained.
RESULTS: Visual evaluation and SUVR were significantly correlated in the 
cerebral cortices (ρ = 0.85-0.87; p < 0.05). In visual evaluation, sensitivity, 
specificity, and accuracy were 78%, 76%, and 77%, respectively. Meanwhile, for 
quantitative evaluation, sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 77%, 79%, 
and 78% in mean cortical SUVR (mcSUVR) and 79%, 79%, and 79% in maximum SUVR 
(maxSUVR), respectively.
CONCLUSION: The PET-only quantification method provided a concordant result with 
visual evaluation and was considered useful for amyloid PET.

preventing irreversible neuronal dysfunction and loss. Generically regarding the 
different neuroimaging modalities as filtered, complementary insights of brain's 
anatomical and functional organization, multimodal data fusion could be 
hypothesized to enhance the predictive power as compared to a unimodal 
prediction of disease progression. More recently, deep learning (DL) based 
methods on structural MRI (sMRI) data have outperformed classical machine 
learning approaches in several neuroimaging applications including diagnostic 
classification and prediction. Similarly, functional MRI (fMRI) features 
estimated using a dynamic (i.e. time-varying) functional connectivity (FC) 
approach have been found to be more discriminative and predictive of the 
clinical diagnosis than those based on the static FC approach. Motivated by 
this, we introduce a novel multimodal data fusion framework featuring deep 
residual learning of non-linear sMRI features and dynamic FC (dFC) based 
extraction of fMRI features to predict the subset of individuals with mild 
cognitive impairments who would progress to Alzheimer's disease within a 
time-period of three years from the baseline scanning sessions. Our 
cross-validated results from the developed multimodal (sMRI-fMRI) data fusion 
framework demonstrate a significant improvement in performance over the unimodal 
prediction analyses with the fMRI (p = 7.03 x 10-7) and sMRI (p = 6.72 x 10-4) 
modalities. As such, the findings in this work highlight the benefits of 
combining multiple neuroimaging data modalities via data fusion, corroborate the 
predictive value of the tested DL and dFC features and argue in favor of 
exploration of similar approaches to learn neuroanatomical and functional 
alterations in the neuroimaging data.

Linguistic theory suggests non-canonical sentences subvert the dominant 
agent-verb-theme order in English via displacement of sentence constituents to 
argument (NP-movement) or non-argument positions (wh-movement). Both processes 
have been associated with the left inferior frontal gyrus and posterior superior 
temporal gyrus, but differences in neural activity and connectivity between 
movement types have not been investigated. In the current study, functional 
magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired from 21 adult participants during 
an auditory sentence-picture verification task using passive and active 
sentences contrasted to isolate NP-movement, and object- and subject-cleft 
sentences contrasted to isolate wh-movement. Then, functional magnetic resonance 
imaging data from regions common to both movement types were entered into a 
dynamic causal modeling analysis to examine effective connectivity for 
wh-movement and NP-movement. Results showed greater left inferior frontal gyrus 
activation for Wh > NP-movement, but no activation for NP > Wh-movement. Both 
types of movement elicited activity in the opercular part of the left inferior 
frontal gyrus, left posterior superior temporal gyrus, and left medial superior 
frontal gyrus. The dynamic causal modeling analyses indicated that neither 
movement type significantly modulated the connection from the left inferior 
frontal gyrus to the left posterior superior temporal gyrus, nor vice-versa, 
suggesting no connectivity differences between wh- and NP-movement. These 
findings support the idea that increased complexity of wh-structures, compared 
to sentences with NP-movement, requires greater engagement of cognitive 
resources via increased neural activity in the left inferior frontal gyrus, but 
both movement types engage similar neural networks.

Electroencephalography (EEG) has long been studied as a potential diagnostic 
method for Alzheimer's disease (AD). The pathological progression of AD leads to 
cortical disconnection. These disconnections may manifest as functional 
connectivity alterations, measured by the degree of synchronization between 
different brain regions, and alterations in complex behaviors produced by the 
interaction among wide-spread brain regions. Recently, machine learning methods, 
such as clustering algorithms and classification methods, have been adopted to 
detect disease-related changes in functional connectivity and classify the 
features of these changes. Although complexity of EEG signals can also reflect 
AD-related changes, few machine learning studies have focused on the changes in 
complexity. Therefore, in this study, we compared the ability of EEG signals to 
detect characteristics of AD using different machine learning approaches one 
focused on functional connectivity and the other focused on signal complexity. 
We examined functional connectivity, estimated by phase lag index (PLI) in EEG 
signals in healthy older participants [healthy control (HC)] and patients with 
AD. We estimated signal complexity using multi-scale entropy. Utilizing a 
support vector machine, we compared the identification accuracy of AD based on 
functional connectivity at each frequency band and complexity component. 
Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between synchronization and 
complexity. The identification accuracy of functional connectivity of the alpha, 
beta, and gamma bands was significantly high (AUC 1.0), and the identification 
accuracy of complexity was sufficiently high (AUC 0.81). Moreover, the 
relationship between functional connectivity and complexity exhibited various 
temporal-scale-and-regional-specific dependency in both HC participants and 
patients with AD. In conclusion, the combination of functional connectivity and 
complexity might reflect complex pathological process of AD. Applying a 
combination of both machine learning methods to neurophysiological data may 
provide a novel understanding of the neural network processes in both healthy 
brains and pathological conditions.

Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the 
elderly after Alzheimer's disease. The aetiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson's 
disease (PD) are still unclear, but the loss of dopaminergic cells and the 
excessive iron deposition in the substantia nigra (SN) are associated with the 
pathophysiology. As an imaging technique that can quantitatively reflect the 
amount of iron deposition, Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) has been 
shown to be a promising modality for the diagnosis of PD. In the present work, 
we propose a hybrid feature extraction method for PD diagnosis using QSM images. 
First, we extract radiomics features from the SN using QSM and employ machine 
learning algorithms to classify PD and normal controls (NC). This approach 
allows us to investigate which features are most vulnerable to the effects of 
the disease. Along with this approach, we propose a Convolutional Neural Network 
(CNN) based method which can extract different features from the QSM image to 
further support the diagnosis of PD. Finally, we combine these two types of 
features and we find that the radiomics features and CNN features are 
complementary to each other, which helps further improve the classification 
(diagnostic) performance. We conclude that: (1) radiomics features from QSM data 
have significant clinical value for the diagnosis of PD; (2) CNN features are 
also useful in the diagnosis of PD; and (3) the combination of radiomics 
features and CNN features can enhance the diagnostic accuracy.

BACKGROUND: Biomarker accuracy for Alzheimer disease (AD) is uncertain.
PURPOSE: To summarize evidence on biomarker accuracy for classifying AD in older 
adults with dementia.
DATA SOURCES: Electronic bibliographic databases (searched from January 2012 to 
November 2019 for brain imaging and cerebrospinal fluid [CSF] tests and from 
inception to November 2019 for blood tests), ClinicalTrials.gov (to November 
2019), and systematic review bibliographies.
STUDY SELECTION: English-language studies evaluating the accuracy of brain 
imaging, CSF testing, or blood tests for distinguishing neuropathologically 
defined AD from non-AD among older adults with dementia. Studies with low or 
medium risk of bias were analyzed.
DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers rated risk of bias. One extracted data; the other 
verified accuracy.
DATA SYNTHESIS: Fifteen brain imaging studies and 9 CSF studies met analysis 
criteria. Median sensitivity and specificity, respectively, were 0.91 and 0.92 
for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET), 0.89 and 0.74 for 18F-labeled 
fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) PET, 0.64 and 0.83 for single-photon emission 
computed tomography, and 0.91 and 0.89 for medial temporal lobe atrophy on 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Individual CSF biomarkers and ratios had 
moderate sensitivity (range, 0.62 to 0.83) and specificity (range, 0.53 to 
0.69); in the few direct comparisons, β-amyloid 42 (Aβ42)/phosphorylated tau 
(p-tau) ratio, total tau (t-tau)/Aβ42 ratio, and p-tau appeared more accurate 
than Aβ42 and t-tau alone. Single studies suggested that amyloid PET, 18F-FDG 
PET, and CSF test combinations may add accuracy to clinical evaluation.
LIMITATIONS: Studies were small, biomarker cut points and neuropathologic AD 
were inconsistently defined, and methods with uncertain applicability to typical 
clinical settings were used. Few studies directly compared biomarkers, assessed 
test combinations, evaluated whether biomarkers improved classification accuracy 
when added to clinical evaluation, or reported harms.
CONCLUSION: In methodologically heterogeneous studies of uncertain applicability 
to typical clinical settings, amyloid PET, 18F-FDG PET, and MRI were highly 
sensitive for neuropathologic AD. Amyloid PET, 18F-FDG PET, and CSF test 
combinations may add accuracy to clinical evaluation.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the cutoffs that optimized the agreement between 18 
F-Florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) and Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40, tTau, pTau 
and their ratios measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) on the LUMIPULSE G600II 
instrument, we quantified the levels of these four biomarkers in 94 CSF samples 
from participants of the Sant Pau Initiative on Neurodegeneration (SPIN cohort) 
using the Lumipulse G System with available 18 F-Florbetapir imaging.
METHODS: Participants had mild cognitive impairment (n = 35), AD dementia 
(n = 12), other dementias or neurodegenerative diseases (n = 41), or were 
cognitively normal controls (n = 6). Levels of Aβ1-42 were standardized to 
certified reference material. Amyloid scans were assessed visually and through 
automated quantification. We determined the cutoffs of CSF biomarkers that 
optimized their agreement with 18 F-Florbetapir PET and evaluated concordance 
between markers of the amyloid category.
RESULTS: Aβ1-42, tTau and pTau (but not Aβ1-40) and the ratios with Aβ1-42 had 
good diagnostic agreement with 18 F-Florbetapir PET. As a marker of amyloid 
pathology, the Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio had higher agreement and better correlation 
with amyloid PET than Aβ1-42 alone.
INTERPRETATION: CSF biomarkers measured with the Lumipulse G System show good 
agreement with amyloid imaging in a clinical setting with heterogeneous 
presentations of neurological disorders. Combination of Aβ1-42 with Aβ1-40 
increases the agreement between markers of amyloid pathology.

PURPOSE: To demonstrate accurate MR image reconstruction from undersampled 
k-space data using cross-domain convolutional neural networks (CNNs) METHODS: 
Cross-domain CNNs consist of 3 components: (1) a deep CNN operating on the 
k-space (KCNN), (2) a deep CNN operating on an image domain (ICNN), and (3) an 
interleaved data consistency operations. These components are alternately 
applied, and each CNN is trained to minimize the loss between the reconstructed 
and corresponding fully sampled k-spaces. The final reconstructed image is 
obtained by forward-propagating the undersampled k-space data through the entire 
network.
RESULTS: Performances of K-net (KCNN with inverse Fourier transform), I-net 
(ICNN with interleaved data consistency), and various combinations of the 2 
different networks were tested. The test results indicated that K-net and I-net 
have different advantages/disadvantages in terms of tissue-structure 
restoration. Consequently, the combination of K-net and I-net is superior to 
single-domain CNNs. Three MR data sets, the T2 fluid-attenuated inversion 
recovery (T2 FLAIR) set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and 
2 data sets acquired at our local institute (T2 FLAIR and T1 weighted), were 
used to evaluate the performance of 7 conventional reconstruction algorithms and 
the proposed cross-domain CNNs, which hereafter is referred to as KIKI-net. 
KIKI-net outperforms conventional algorithms with mean improvements of 2.29 dB 
in peak SNR and 0.031 in structure similarity.
CONCLUSION: KIKI-net exhibits superior performance over state-of-the-art 
conventional algorithms in terms of restoring tissue structures and removing 
aliasing artifacts. The results demonstrate that KIKI-net is applicable up to a 
reduction factor of 3 to 4 based on variable-density Cartesian undersampling.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterised by episodic memory impairment, but 
people also experience memory distortions, including false memories, which can 
impact on safety and reduce functioning. Understanding the neural networks that 
underpin false memories could help to predict the need for intervention and 
guide development of cognitive strategies to reduce memory errors. However, 
there is a relative absence of research into how the neuropathology of AD 
contributes to false memory generation. This paper systematically reviews the 
methodology and outcomes of studies investigating the neuroimaging correlates of 
false memory in AD. Four studies using structural imaging and three studies 
using functional imaging were identified. Studies were heterogenous in 
methodology and received mostly 'weak' quality assessment ratings. Combined, and 
consistent with neuroimaging findings in non-AD populations, results from 
identified studies provide preliminary support for the hypothesis that medial 
temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex dysfunction may lead to generation of false 
memories in AD. However, the small number of studies and significant 
heterogeneity within them means further study is necessary to assess 
replicability of results.

INTRODUCTION: Heterogeneity of segmentation protocols for medial temporal lobe 
regions and hippocampal subfields on in vivo magnetic resonance imaging hinders 
the ability to integrate findings across studies. We aim to develop a harmonized 
protocol based on expert consensus and histological evidence.
METHODS: Our international working group, funded by the EU Joint 
Programme-Neurodegenerative Disease Research (JPND), is working toward the 
production of a reliable, validated, harmonized protocol for segmentation of 
medial temporal lobe regions. The working group uses a novel postmortem data set 
and online consensus procedures to ensure validity and facilitate adoption.
RESULTS: This progress report describes the initial results and milestones that 
we have achieved to date, including the development of a draft protocol and 
results from the initial reliability tests and consensus procedures.
DISCUSSION: A harmonized protocol will enable the standardization of 
segmentation methods across laboratories interested in medial temporal lobe 
research worldwide.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a degenerative brain disorder that often 
occurs in people over 65 years old. As advanced AD is difficult to manage, 
accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed 
effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning 
methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are 
affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a 
deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is 
less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 
fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography 
(FDG-PET/CT).
RESULTS: The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 
86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, 
and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive 
(NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological 
changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered 
statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets 
for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance 
comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically 
significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model demonstrated the effectiveness of AD 
classification using the GAP layer. Our model learned the AD features from PCC 
in both the ADNI and Severance datasets, which can be seen in the heatmap. 
Furthermore, we showed that there were no significant differences in performance 
using statistical analysis.

OBJECTIVES: African Americans are at greater risk for developing Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) dementia than non-Hispanic whites. In addition to biological 
considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and 
environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) 
assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration 
(N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of 
socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular 
disease on observed race differences.
METHODS: Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography 
[PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional 
connectivity (rs-fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n 
= 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small 
vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, 
blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area-based SES were included in 
mediation analyses.
RESULTS: Compared to white participants, African American participants had 
greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's f2 
= 0.05, p < 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical 
volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs-fc 
signature.
INTERPRETATION: Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and 
resources, particularly area-level SES, may contribute to observed racial 
differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant 
psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and 
inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic 
representativeness of AD studies. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:254-265.

OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to examine sex differences in tau 
distribution across the brain of older adults, using positron emission 
tomography (PET), and investigate how these differences might associate with 
cognitive trajectories.
METHODS: Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 
[8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 
76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined 18 F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-positron emission 
tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest 
(ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP-signal for 
each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions 
between sex*Aβ-PET positive / negative (+ / -) and sex*apolipoprotein ε4 
(APOEε4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on 
the relationship between a composite of sex-differentiated tau ROIs and 
cognitive decline.
RESULTS: Women showed significantly higher FTP-signals than men across multiple 
regions of the cortical mantle (p < 0.007). β-amyloid (Aβ)-moderated sex 
differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio-lateral temporal 
regions (p < 0.007); Aβ + women exhibited greater FTP-signal than other groups. 
APOEε4-moderated sex differences in FTP-signal were only found in the lateral 
occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP-signals in composite ROI exhibited faster 
cognitive decline than men (p = 0.04).
INTERPRETATION: Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial 
temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive 
decline. Interactive effects of sex and Aβ were predominantly localized in the 
temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra-temporal tau highlights the 
possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical 
symptomatology. ANN NEUROL 2020;88:921-932.

The projected burden of dementia by Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a 
looming healthcare crisis as the population of most countries grows older. 
Although there is currently no cure, it is possible to treat symptoms of 
dementia. Early diagnosis is paramount to the development and success of 
interventions, and neuroimaging represents one of the most promising areas for 
early detection of AD. We aimed to deploy advanced deep learning methods to 
determine whether they can extract useful AD biomarkers from structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (sMRI) and classify brain images into AD, mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) groups. We tailored and trained 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on sMRIs of the brain from datasets 
available in online databases. Our proposed method, ADNet, was evaluated on the 
CADDementia challenge and outperformed several approaches in the prior art. The 
method's configuration with machine-learning domain adaptation, ADNet-DA, 
reached 52.3% accuracy. Contributions of our study include devising a deep 
learning system that is entirely automatic and comparatively fast, presenting 
competitive results without using any patient's domain-specific knowledge about 
the disease. We were able to implement an end-to-end CNN system to classify 
subjects into AD, MCI, or CN groups, reflecting the identification of 
distinctive elements in brain images. In this context, our system represents a 
promising tool in finding biomarkers to help with the diagnosis of AD and, 
eventually, many other diseases.

Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proceeding hot issue along with 
a sharp upward trend in the incidence rate. Recently, early diagnosis of AD 
employing Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a specific hallmark has been an 
increasingly significant hot topic area. In consideration of the limited size of 
available EEG spectral images, how to extract more abstract features for better 
generalization still remains tremendously troubling. In this paper, we 
demonstrate that it can be settled well with multi-task learning strategy based 
on discriminative convolutional high-order Boltzmann Machine with hybrid feature 
maps. First, differently from our original model - Contractive Slab and Spike 
Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (CssCDBM), we directly conduct EEG spectral 
image classification via inducing label layer, resulting in a discriminative 
version of CssCDBM, referred to as DCssCDBM. This demonstrates DCssCDBM can be 
extended well into the classification model instead of feature extractor alone 
previously. Then, the most important approach innovation is that we train our 
DCssCDBM with multi-task learning framework via EEG spectral images based 
Identification and verification tasks for overfitting reduction for the first 
time, which could increase the inter-subject variations and reduce the 
intra-subject variations respectively, both of which are essential to early 
diagnosis of AD. The proposed method shows the better ability of high-level 
representations extraction and demonstrates the advanced results over several 
state-of-the-art methods.

18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) enables in-vivo 
capture of the topographic metabolism patterns in the brain. These images have 
shown great promise in revealing the altered metabolism patterns in Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The AD pathology is progressive, and leads to structural and 
functional alterations that lie on a continuum. There is a need to quantify the 
altered metabolism patterns that exist on a continuum into a simple measure. 
This work proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections 
that generates a probability score useful for interpreting the FDG-PET images 
along the continuum of AD. This network is trained and tested on images of 
stable normal control and stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) 
subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.976 via repeated fivefold cross-validation. An 
independent test set consisting of images in between the two extreme ends of the 
DAT spectrum is used to further test the generalization performance of the 
network. Classification performance of 0.811 AUC is achieved in the task of 
predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment to DAT for conversion time of 
0-3 years. The saliency and class activation maps, which highlight the regions 
of the brain that are most important to the classification task, implicate many 
known regions affected by DAT including the posterior cingulate cortex, 
precuneus, and hippocampus.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with 
progressive impairment of memory and other mental functions. Magnetic resonance 
images (MRI) have been widely used as an important imaging modality of brain for 
AD diagnosis and monitoring the disease progression. The longitudinal analysis 
of sequential MRIs is important to model and measure the progression of the 
disease along the time axis for more accurate diagnosis. Most existing methods 
extracted the features capturing the morphological abnormalities of brain and 
their longitudinal changes using MRIs and then designed a classifier to 
discriminate different groups. However, these methods have several limitations. 
First, since the feature extraction and classifier model are independent, the 
extracted features may not capture the full characteristics of brain 
abnormalities related to AD. Second, longitudinal MR images may be missing at 
some time points for some subjects, which results in difficulties for extraction 
of consistent features for longitudinal analysis. In this paper, we present a 
classification framework based on combination of convolutional and recurrent 
neural networks for longitudinal analysis of structural MR images in AD 
diagnosis. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is constructed to learn 
the spatial features of MR images for the classification task. After that, 
recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with cascaded three bidirectional gated 
recurrent units (BGRU) layers is constructed on the outputs of CNN at multiple 
time points for extracting the longitudinal features for AD classification. 
Instead of independently performing feature extraction and classifier training, 
the proposed method jointly learns the spatial and longitudinal features and 
disease classifier, which can achieve optimal performance. In addition, the 
proposed method can model the longitudinal analysis using RNN from the imaging 
data at various time points. Our method is evaluated with the longitudinal 
T1-weighted MR images of 830 participants including 198 AD, 403 mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and 229 normal controls (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the 
proposed method achieves classification accuracy of 91.33% for AD vs. NC and 
71.71% for pMCI vs. sMCI, demonstrating the promising performance for 
longitudinal MR image analysis.

Tau tangles are a pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
exhibit a stereotypical pattern of spatiotemporal spread which has strong links 
to disease progression and cognitive decline. Preclinical evidence suggests that 
tau spread depends on neuronal connectivity rather than physical proximity 
between different brain regions. Here, we present a novel physics-informed 
geometric learning model for predicting tau buildup and spread that learns 
patterns directly from longitudinal tau imaging data while receiving guidance 
from governing physical principles. Implemented as a graph neural network with 
physics-based regularization in latent space, the model enables effective 
training with smaller data sizes. For training and validation of the model, we 
used longitudinal tau measures from positron emission tomography (PET) and 
structural connectivity graphs from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) from the 
Harvard Aging Brain Study. The model led to higher peak signal-to-noise ratio 
and lower mean squared error levels than both an unregularized graph neural 
network and a differential equation solver. The method was validated using both 
two-timepoint and three-timepoint tau PET measures. The effectiveness of the 
approach was further confirmed by a cross-validation study.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether amyloid imaging with the positron emission 
tomography (PET) agent Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) can detect vascular β-amyloid 
(Aβ) in the essentially pure form of cerebral amyloid angiopathy associated with 
the Dutch-type hereditary cerebral amyloid angiopathy (D-CAA) mutation.
METHODS: PiB retention in a cortical composite of frontal, lateral, and 
retrosplenial regions (FLR) was measured by PiB-PET in 19 D-CAA mutation 
carriers (M+ ; 13 without neurologic symptoms, 6 with prior lobar intracerebral 
hemorrhage) and 17 mutation noncarriers (M- ). Progression of PiB retention was 
analyzed in a subset of 18 serially imaged individuals (10 asymptomatic M+ , 8 
M- ). We also analyzed associations between PiB retention and cerebrospinal 
fluid (CSF) Aβ concentrations in 17 M+ and 11 M- participants who underwent 
lumbar puncture and compared the findings to PiB-PET and CSF Aβ in 37 autosomal 
dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers.
RESULTS: D-CAA M+ showed greater age-dependent FLR PiB retention (p < 0.001) 
than M- , and serially imaged asymptomatic M+ demonstrated greater longitudinal 
increases (p = 0.004). Among M+ , greater FLR PiB retention associated with 
reduced CSF concentrations of Aβ40 (r = -0.55, p = 0.021) but not Aβ42 (r 
= 0.01, p = 0.991). Despite comparably low CSF Aβ40 and Aβ42, PiB retention was 
substantially less in D-CAA than ADAD (p < 0.001).
INTERPRETATION: Increased PiB retention in D-CAA and correlation with reduced 
CSF Aβ40 suggest this compound labels vascular amyloid, although to a lesser 
degree than amyloid deposits in ADAD. Progression in PiB signal over time 
suggests amyloid PET as a potential biomarker in trials of candidate agents for 
this untreatable cause of hemorrhagic stroke. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:616-625.

statistical power analysis was performed across biomarkers and groups based on 
longitudinal mixed effects modeling and using several different clinical trial 
designs.
RESULTS: For a 30-month trial of preclinical AD, both the temporal composite and 
hippocampal volumes were superior to plasma neurofilament light and cognition. 
For an 18-month trial of mild AD, hippocampal volume was superior to all other 
biomarkers. Plasma neurofilament light became more effective with increased 
trial duration or sampling frequency. Imaging biomarkers were characterized by 
high slope and low within-subject variability, while plasma neurofilament light 
and cognition were characterized by higher within-subject variability.
INTERPRETATION: MRI measures had properties that made them preferable to 
cognition and pNFL as outcome measures in clinical trials of early AD, 
regardless of cognitive status. However, pNfL and cognition can still be 
effective depending on inclusion criteria, sampling frequency, and response to 
therapy. Future trials will help to understand how sensitive pNfL and MRI are to 
detect downstream effects on neurodegeneration of drugs targeting amyloid and 
tau pathology in AD.

OBJECTIVE: To examine associations between tau and amyloid β (Aβ) molecular 
positron emission tomography (PET) and both Alzheimer-related pathology and 
4-repeat tau pathology in autopsy-confirmed frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
(FTLD).
METHODS: Twenty-four patients had [18 F]-flortaucipir-PET and died with FTLD 
(progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], n = 10; corticobasal degeneration [CBD], 
n = 10; FTLD-TDP, n = 3; and Pick disease, n = 1). All but 1 had Pittsburgh 
compound B (PiB)-PET. Braak staging, Aβ plaque and neurofibrillary tangle 
counts, and semiquantitative tau lesion scores were performed. Flortaucipir 
standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region 
of interest (meta-ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions 
selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. 
Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to 
quantify tau burden.
RESULTS: Nine cases (37.5%) had Aβ plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with Aβ 
plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. 
Twenty-one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with 
neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI 
SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age-related tauopathy. 
Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate 
PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and 
midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia 
regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although 
flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions.
INTERPRETATION: Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer-related 
pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD. 
Regional flortaucipir uptake was able to separate CBD and PSP. ANN NEUROL

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of progressive and 
irreversible dementia, and accurate diagnosis of AD at its prodromal stage is 
clinically important. Currently, computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission 
tomography (18F-FDG PET) imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features 
or deep learning methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient 
classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore 
aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to 
improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can 
reveal pathological information.
METHODS: In this study, 18F-FDG PET and clinical assessments were collected in a 
cohort of 422 individuals [including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy 
controls (HCs)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 
44 individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital, 
Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a two-sample 
Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) based on 30 AD 
patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on two time scans of 32 HCs 
from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient for radiomic feature 
stability analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients were regarded as a 
feature selection criterion, to select effective features associated with the 
clinical cognitive scale [clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes 
(CDRSB); Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times 
cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to test the 
ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD patients.
RESULTS: As a result, we identified brain regions which were mainly distributed 
in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs. A total of 168 radiomic 
features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The classification experiment led to 
maximal accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI 
versus HCs and AD versus MCI.
CONCLUSION: The research in this paper proved that the novel approach based on 
high-order radiomic features extracted from 18F-FDG PET brain images that can be 
used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnosis.

Accurate spatial normalization (SN) of amyloid positron emission tomography 
(PET) images for Alzheimer's disease assessment without coregistered anatomical 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the same individual is technically 
challenging. In this study, we applied deep neural networks to generate 
individually adaptive PET templates for robust and accurate SN of amyloid PET 
without using matched 3D MR images. Using 681 pairs of simultaneously acquired 
11 C-PIB PET and T1-weighted 3D MRI scans of AD, MCI, and cognitively normal 
subjects, we trained and tested two deep neural networks [convolutional 
auto-encoder (CAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN)] that produce 
adaptive best PET templates. More specifically, the networks were trained using 
685,100 pieces of augmented data generated by rotating 527 randomly selected 
datasets and validated using 154 datasets. The input to the supervised neural 
networks was the 3D PET volume in native space and the label was the spatially 
normalized 3D PET image using the transformation parameters obtained from 
MRI-based SN. The proposed deep learning approach significantly enhanced the 
quantitative accuracy of MRI-less amyloid PET assessment by reducing the SN 
error observed when an average amyloid PET template is used. Given an input 
image, the trained deep neural networks rapidly provide individually adaptive 3D 
PET templates without any discontinuity between the slices (in 0.02 s). As the 
proposed method does not require 3D MRI for the SN of PET images, it has great 
potential for use in routine analysis of amyloid PET images in clinical practice 
and research.

Written by associate editors of the Annals of Nuclear Medicine, this invited 
review article is intended to offer our readers a condensed global view on the 
high-quality research work that has been published in Europe last year. We have 
divided this article into five sections. The first three sections from the 
oncology category include "[18F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron-emission 
tomography (PET) for therapy monitoring in malignant lymphoma", 
"[18F]fluoromisonidazole (FMISO) PET for hypoxia", and "lymphoscintigraphy 
update". It is followed by a section on "amyloid PET for Alzheimer's disease" 
using [11C]Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) and [18F]florbetapir from the neurology 
category. The final section reviews three original articles in the field of 
"basic and translational molecular imaging" regardless of the category, which 
investigated new PET tracers such as L-4-borono-2-[18F]fluoro-phenylalanine 
(FBPA), O-(2-[18F]fluoroethyl)-L-tyrosine (FET) and 64Cu-NOTA-pertuzumab in 
small animals. We hope that this review article will arouse greater interest in 
our readers in recent European research trends in the field of nuclear medicine.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the prodromal stage of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Identifying MCI subjects who are at high risk of converting to AD is 
crucial for effective treatments. In this study, a deep learning approach based 
on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is designed to accurately predict 
MCI-to-AD conversion with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. First, MRI 
images are prepared with age-correction and other processing. Second, local 
patches, which are assembled into 2.5 dimensions, are extracted from these 
images. Then, the patches from AD and normal controls (NC) are used to train a 
CNN to identify deep learning features of MCI subjects. After that, structural 
brain image features are mined with FreeSurfer to assist CNN. Finally, both 
types of features are fed into an extreme learning machine classifier to predict 
the AD conversion. The proposed approach is validated on the standardized MRI 
datasets from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) project. 
This approach achieves an accuracy of 79.9% and an area under the receiver 
operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 86.1% in leave-one-out cross 
validations. Compared with other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed one 
outperforms others with higher accuracy and AUC, while keeping a good balance 
between the sensitivity and specificity. Results demonstrate great potentials of 
the proposed CNN-based approach for the prediction of MCI-to-AD conversion with 
solely MRI data. Age correction and assisted structural brain image features can 
boost the prediction performance of CNN.

OBJECTIVE: Slow-wave activity (SWA) during sleep is reduced in people with 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and is related to sleep-dependent 
memory consolidation. Acoustic stimulation of slow oscillations has proven 
effective in enhancing SWA and memory in younger and older adults. In this study 
we aimed to determine whether acoustic stimulation during sleep boosts SWA and 
improves memory performance in people with aMCI.
METHODS: Nine adults with aMCI (72 ± 8.7 years) completed one night of acoustic 
stimulation (stim) and one night of sham stimulation (sham) in a blinded, 
randomized crossover study. Acoustic stimuli were delivered phase-locked to the 
upstate of the endogenous sleep slow-waves. Participants completed a declarative 
recall task with 44 word-pairs before and after sleep.
RESULTS: During intervals of acoustic stimulation, SWA increased by >10% over 
sham intervals (P < 0.01), but memory recall increased in only five of the nine 
patients. The increase in SWA with stimulation was associated with improved 
morning word recall (r = 0.78, P = 0.012).
INTERPRETATION: Acoustic stimulation delivered during slow-wave sleep over one 
night was effective for enhancing SWA in individuals with aMCI. Given 
established relationships between SWA and memory, a larger or more prolonged 
enhancement may be needed to consistently improve memory in aMCI.

Alzheimer's disease is a neuropsychiatric, progressive, also an irreversible 
disease. There is not an effective cure for the disease. However, early 
diagnosis has an important role for treatment planning to delay its progression 
since the treatments have the most impact at the early stage of the disease. 
Neuroimages obtained by different imaging techniques (for example, diffusion 
tensor-based and magnetic resonance-based imaging) provide powerful information 
and help to diagnose the disease. In this work, a deeply supervised and robust 
method has been developed using three dimensional features to provide objective 
and accurate diagnosis from magnetic resonance images. The main contributions 
are (a) a new three dimensional convolutional neural network topology; (b) a new 
Sobolev gradient-based optimization with weight values for each decision 
parameters; (c) application of the proposed topology and optimizer to diagnose 
Alzheimer's disease; (d) comparisons of the results obtained from the recent 
techniques that have been implemented for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. 
Experimental results and quantitative evaluations indicated that the proposed 
network model is able to achieve to extract desired features from images and 
provides automated diagnosis with 98.06% accuracy.

Early detection is crucial to prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon as possible. They 
demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of AD in the earliest and 
hardest to detect stages. The main objective of this work is to develop a system 
that automatically detects the presence of the disease in sagittal magnetic 
resonance images (MRI), which are not generally used. Sagittal MRIs from ADNI 
and OASIS data sets were employed. Experiments were conducted using Transfer 
Learning (TL) techniques in order to achieve more accurate results. There are 
two main conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages related to 
AD and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second, the results 
obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the state-of-the-art, 
which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although sagittal-plane MRIs are not 
commonly used, this work proved that they were, at least, as effective as MRI 
from other planes at identifying AD in early stages. This could pave the way for 
further research. Finally, one should bear in mind that in certain fields, 
obtaining the examples for a data set can be very expensive. This study proved 
that DL models could be built in these fields, whereas TL is an essential tool 
for completing the task with fewer examples.

A Multi-modal Convolutional Neural Network Framework for the Prediction of 
Alzheimer's Disease.

Spasov SE, Passamonti L, Duggento A, Lio P, Toschi N.

This paper presents a multi-modal Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification 
framework based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The 
devised model takes structural MRI, and clinical assessment and genetic (APOe4) 
measures as inputs. Our CNN structure is designed to be efficient in its use of 
parameters which reduces overfitting, computational complexity, memory 
requirements and speed of prototyping. This is achieved by factorising the 
convolutional layers in parallel streams which also enables the simultaneous 
extraction of high and low level feature representations. Our method 
consistently achieves high classification results in discriminating between AD 
and control subjects with an average of 99% accuracy, 98% sensitivity, 100% 
specificity and an AUC of 1 across all test folds. Our study confirms that 
careful tuning of CNN characteristics can result in a framework which delivers 
extremely accurate predictions in a clinical problem despite data paucity, 
opening new avenues for application to prediction tasks which regard patient 
stratification, prediction of clinical evolution and eventually personalised 
medicine applications.

Joint Classification and Regression via Deep Multi-Task Multi-Channel Learning 
for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.

Liu M, Zhang J, Adeli E, Shen D.

In the field of computer-aided Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, jointly 
identifying brain diseases and predicting clinical scores using magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) have attracted increasing attention since these two 
tasks are highly correlated. Most of existing joint learning approaches require 
hand-crafted feature representations for MR images. Since hand-crafted features 
of MRI and classification/regression models may not coordinate well with each 
other, conventional methods may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, 
demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also 
be related to brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic 
performance. However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate 
such demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we propose a 
deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM 2L) framework for simultaneous brain 
disease classification and clinical score regression, using MRI data and 
demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we first identify the 
discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and 
then extract multiple image patches around these detected landmarks. We then 
propose a deep multi-task multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint 
classification and regression. Our DM 2L framework can not only automatically 
learn discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate the 
demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We evaluate the 
proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with 1984 subjects, and the 
experimental results demonstrate that DM 2L is superior to several 
state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the tasks of disease 
classification and clinical score regression.

Despite the crucial role of the hypothalamus in the regulation of the human 
body, neuroimaging studies of this structure and its nuclei are scarce. Such 
scarcity partially stems from the lack of automated segmentation tools, since 
manual delineation suffers from scalability and reproducibility issues. Due to 
the small size of the hypothalamus and the lack of image contrast in its 
vicinity, automated segmentation is difficult and has been long neglected by 
widespread neuroimaging packages like FreeSurfer or FSL. Nonetheless, recent 
advances in deep machine learning are enabling us to tackle difficult 
segmentation problems with high accuracy. In this paper we present a fully 
automated tool based on a deep convolutional neural network, for the 
segmentation of the whole hypothalamus and its subregions from T1-weighted MRI 
scans. We use aggressive data augmentation in order to make the model robust to 
T1-weighted MR scans from a wide array of different sources, without any need 
for preprocessing. We rigorously assess the performance of the presented tool 
through extensive analyses, including: inter- and intra-rater variability 
experiments between human observers; comparison of our tool with manual 
segmentation; comparison with an automated method based on multi-atlas 
segmentation; assessment of robustness by quality control analysis of a larger, 
heterogeneous dataset (ADNI); and indirect evaluation with a volumetric study 
performed on ADNI. The presented model outperforms multi-atlas segmentation 
scores as well as inter-rater accuracy level, and approaches intra-rater 
precision. Our method does not require any preprocessing and runs in less than a 
second on a GPU, and approximately 10 seconds on a CPU. The source code as well 
as the trained model are publicly available at 
https://github.com/BBillot/hypothalamus_seg, and will also be distributed with 
FreeSurfer.

Fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) has been widely used 
for resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) based 
schizophrenia (SZ) diagnosis. However, previous studies usually measure the 
fALFF within low-frequency fluctuation (from 0.01 to 0.08Hz), which cannot fully 
cover the complex neural activity pattern in the resting-state brain. In 
addition, existing studies usually ignore the fact that each specific frequency 
band can delineate the unique spontaneous fluctuations of neural activities in 
the brain. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical 
structured sparse learning method to sufficiently utilize the specificity and 
complementary structure information across four different frequency bands (from 
0.01Hz to 0.25Hz) for SZ diagnosis. The proposed method can help preserve the 
partial group structures among multiple frequency bands and the specific 
characters in each frequency band. We further develop an efficient optimization 
algorithm to solve the proposed objective function. We validate the efficacy of 
our proposed method on a real SZ dataset. Also, to demonstrate the generality of 
the method, we apply our proposed method on a subset of Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results on both datasets 
demonstrate that our proposed method achieves promising performance in brain 
disease classification, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.

Elevated brain activation, or hyperexcitability, induces cognitive impairment 
and confers an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Blocking the 
overexcitation of the neural network may be a promising new strategy to prevent, 
halt, and even reverse this condition. Physical exercise has been shown to be an 
effective cognitive enhancer that reduces the risk of AD in elderly individuals, 
but the underlying mechanisms are far from being fully understood. We explored 
whether long-term treadmill exercise attenuates amyloid precursor protein 
(APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation-induced aberrant network activity and thus 
improves cognition by altering the numbers and/or distribution of voltage-gated 
sodium channels (Nav) in transgenic mice. APP/PS1 mice aged 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, 
and 9 months underwent treadmill exercise with different durations or at 
different stages of AD. The alterations in memory, electroencephalogram (EEG) 
recordings, and expression levels and distributions of Nav functional members 
(Nav1.1α, Nav1.2, Nav1.6, and Navβ2) were evaluated. The results revealed that 
treadmill exercise with 12- and 24-week durations 1) induced significant 
improvement in novel object recognition (NOR) memory and Morris water maze (MWM) 
spatial memory; 2) partially reduced abnormal spike activity; and 3) redressed 
the disturbed cellular distribution of Nav1.1α, aberrant Navβ2 cleavage 
augmentation, and Nav1.6 upregulation. Additionally, APP/PS1 mice in the 24-week 
exercise group showed better performance in the NOR task and a large decrease in 
Nav1.6 expression, which was close to the wild-type level. This study suggests 
that exercise improves cognition and neural activity by altering the numbers and 
distribution of hippocampal Nav in APP/PS1 mice. Long-term treadmill exercise, 
for about 24 weeks, starting in the preclinical stage, is a promising 
therapeutic strategy for preventing AD and halting its progress.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible devastative neurodegenerative 
disorder associated with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive 
functions. Its early diagnosis is crucial for the development of possible future 
treatment option(s). Structural magnetic resonance images (sMRI) play an 
important role to help in understanding the anatomical changes related to AD 
especially in its early stages. Conventional methods require the expertise of 
domain experts and extract hand-picked features such as gray matter 
substructures and train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from healthy 
subjects. Different from these methods, this paper proposes to construct 
multiple deep 2D convolutional neural networks (2D-CNNs) to learn the various 
features from local brain images which are combined to make the final 
classification for AD diagnosis. The whole brain image was passed through two 
transfer learning architectures; Inception version 3 and Xception, as well as a 
custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with the help of separable 
convolutional layers which can automatically learn the generic features from 
imaging data for classification. Our study is conducted using cross-sectional 
T1-weighted structural MRI brain images from Open Access Series of Imaging 
Studies (OASIS) database to maintain the size and contrast over different MRI 
scans. Experimental results show that the transfer learning approaches exceed 
the performance of non-transfer learning-based approaches demonstrating the 
effectiveness of these approaches for the binary AD classification task.

PURPOSE: PET measures of amyloid and tau pathologies are powerful biomarkers for 
the diagnosis and monitoring of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Because cortical 
regions are close to bone, quantitation accuracy of amyloid and tau PET imaging 
can be significantly influenced by errors of attenuation correction (AC). This 
work presents an MR-based AC method that combines deep learning with a novel 
ultrashort time-to-echo (UTE)/multi-echo Dixon (mUTE) sequence for amyloid and 
tau imaging.
METHODS: Thirty-five subjects that underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-MK6240 scans 
were included in this study. The proposed method was compared with Dixon-based 
atlas method as well as magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient 
echo (MPRAGE)- or Dixon-based deep learning methods. The Dice coefficient and 
validation loss of the generated pseudo-CT images were used for comparison. PET 
error images regarding standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were quantified 
through regional and surface analysis to evaluate the final AC accuracy.
RESULTS: The Dice coefficients of the deep learning methods based on MPRAGE, 
Dixon, and mUTE images were 0.84 (0.91), 0.84 (0.92), and 0.87 (0.94) for the 
whole-brain (above-eye) bone regions, respectively, higher than the atlas method 
of 0.52 (0.64). The regional SUVR error for the atlas method was around 6%, 
higher than the regional SUV error. The regional SUV and SUVR errors for all 
deep learning methods were below 2%, with mUTE-based deep learning method 
performing the best. As for the surface analysis, the atlas method showed the 
largest error (> 10%) near vertices inside superior frontal, lateral occipital, 
superior parietal, and inferior temporal cortices. The mUTE-based deep learning 
method resulted in the least number of regions with error higher than 1%, with 
the largest error (> 5%) showing up near the inferior temporal and medial 
orbitofrontal cortices.
CONCLUSION: Deep learning with mUTE can generate accurate AC for amyloid and tau 
imaging in PET/MR.

Deep Learning of Static and Dynamic Brain Functional Networks for Early MCI 
Detection.

Kam TE, Zhang H, Jiao Z, Shen D.

While convolutional neural network (CNN) has been demonstrating powerful ability 
to learn hierarchical spatial features from medical images, it is still 
difficult to apply it directly to resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) and the 
derived brain functional networks (BFNs). We propose a novel CNN framework to 
simultaneously learn embedded features from BFNs for brain disease diagnosis. 
Since BFNs can be built by considering both static and dynamic functional 
connectivity (FC), we first decompose rs-fMRI into multiple static BFNs with 
modified independent component analysis. Then, the voxel-wise variability in 
dynamic FC is used to quantify BFN dynamics. A set of paired 3D images 
representing static/dynamic BFNs can be fed into 3D CNNs, from which we can 
hierarchically and simultaneously learn static/dynamic BFN features. As a 
result, the dynamic BFN features can complement static BFN features and, at the 
meantime, different BFNs can help each other toward a joint and better 
classification. We validate our method with a publicly accessible, large cohort 
of rs-fMRI dataset in early-stage mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) diagnosis, 
which is one of the most challenging problems to the clinicians. By comparing 
with a conventional method, our method shows significant diagnostic performance 
improvement by almost 10%. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of deep 
learning in preclinical Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, based on the complex and 
high-dimensional voxel-wise spatiotemporal patterns of the resting-state brain 
functional connectomics. The framework provides a new but intuitive way to fully 
exploit deeply embedded diagnostic features from rs-fMRI for a 
better-individualized diagnosis of various neurological diseases.

BACKGROUND: Studies of elderly subjects using biomarkers that are proxies for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology have the potential to document meaningful 
relationships between cognitive performance and biomarker changes along the AD 
continuum.
OBJECTIVE: To document cognitive performance differences across distinct AD 
stages using a categorization based on the presence of PET-assessed amyloid-β 
(Aβ) burden and neurodegeneration.
METHODS: Patients with mild dementia compatible with AD (n = 38) or amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI; n = 43) and a cognitively unimpaired group 
(n = 27) underwent PET with Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) assessing Aβ aggregation 
(A+) and [18F]FDG-PET assessing neurodegeneration ((N)+). Cognitive performance 
was assessed with verbal and visual episodic memory tests and the Mini-Mental 
State Examination.
RESULTS: The A+(N)+ subgroup (n = 32) showed decreased (p < 0.001) cognitive 
test scores compared to both A+(N)-(n = 18) and A-(N)-(n = 49) subjects, who 
presented highly similar mean cognitive scores. Despite its modest size (n = 9), 
the A-(N)+ subgroup showed lower (p < 0.043) verbal memory scores relative to 
A-(N)-subjects, and trend lower (p = 0.096) scores relative to A+(N)-subjects. 
Continuous Aβ measures (standard uptake value ratios of PiB uptake) were 
correlated most significantly with visual memory scores both in the overall 
sample and when analyses were restricted to dementia or (N)+ subjects, but not 
in non-dementia or (N)-groups.
CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate that significant Aβ-cognition 
relationships are highly salient at disease stages involving neurodegeneration. 
The fact that findings relating Aβ burden to memory performance were detected 
only at (N)+ stages, together with the similarity of test scores between 
A+(N)-and A-(N)-subjects, reinforce the view that Aβ-cognition relationships 
during early AD stages may remain undetectable unless substantially large 
samples are evaluated.

PURPOSE: Although most deep learning (DL) studies have reported excellent 
classification accuracy, these studies usually target typical Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) and normal cognition (NC) for which conventional visual assessment 
performs well. A clinically relevant issue is the selection of high-risk 
subjects who need active surveillance among equivocal cases. We validated the 
clinical feasibility of DL compared with visual rating or quantitative 
measurement for assessing the diagnosis and prognosis of subjects with equivocal 
amyloid scans.
METHODS: 18F-florbetaben scans of 430 cases (85 NC, 233 mild cognitive 
impairment, and 112 AD) were assessed through visual rating-based, 
quantification-based, and DL-based methods. DL was trained using 280 
two-dimensional PET images (80%) and tested by randomly assigning the remaining 
(70 cases, 20%) cases and a clinical validation set of 54 equivocal cases. In 
the equivocal cases, we assessed the agreement among the visual rating, 
quantification, and DL and compared the clinical outcome according to each 
modality-based amyloid status.
RESULTS: The visual reading was positive in 175 cases, equivocal in 54 cases, 
and negative in 201 cases. The composite SUVR cutoff value was 1.32 (AUC 0.99). 
The subject-level performance of DL using the test set was 100%. Among the 54 
equivocal cases, 37 cases were classified as positive (Eq(deep+)) by DL, 40 
cases were classified by a second-round visual assessment, and 40 cases were 
classified by quantification. The DL- and quantification-based classifications 
showed good agreement (83%, κ = 0.59). The composite SUVRs differed between 
Eq(deep+) (1.47 [0.13]) and Eq(deep-) (1.29 [0.10]; P < 0.001). DL, but not the 
visual rating, showed a significant difference in the Mini-Mental Status 
Examination score change during the follow-up between Eq(deep+) (- 4.21 [0.57]) 
and Eq(deep-) (- 1.74 [0.76]; P = 0.023) (mean duration, 1.76 years).
CONCLUSIONS: In visually equivocal scans, DL was more related to quantification 
than to visual assessment, and the negative cases selected by DL showed no 
decline in cognitive outcome. DL is useful for clinical diagnosis and prognosis 
assessment in subjects with visually equivocal amyloid scans.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the patterns of longitudinal tau accumulation and cortical 
atrophy and their association in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODS: We collected 23 participants (60-89 years old, 11 males/12 females) 
with MCI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. All 
participants underwent 18F flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) 
and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at the baseline and 
follow-up visits (12-36 months). General linear models with covariates (baseline 
age, sex) were used to detect brain areas of significant tau accumulation and 
atrophy over time. Mediation analysis was employed to explore the potential 
reason for sequential biomarker changes in MCI progression, adjusting for 
baseline age, sex, and education level.
RESULTS: Voxel-wise tau accumulation in MCI subjects was predominantly located 
in the inferior temporal cortex, middle temporal cortex, parietal cortex, 
posterior cingulate, precuneus, and temporoparietal regions (P < 0.001), and MRI 
atrophy included the inferior-middle temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and precuneus 
(P < 0.001). Longitudinal FTP accumulation was moderately associated with 
annualized MRI cortical atrophy (r = 0.409, 95% CI: 0.405-0.414, P < 0.01). 
Regional analyses indicated significant bivariate associations between 
annualized MRI cortical atrophy and FTP accumulation (baseline FTP cortical 
uptake and longitudinal FTP change). The results of the mediation analysis 
showed that the relationship between baseline FTP uptake and longitudinal 
cortical atrophy was partly mediated by the longitudinal FTP cortical change 
(indirect effect: 0.0107, P = 0.04).
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide a preliminary description of the patterns of 
longitudinal FTP accumulation and annualized cortical atrophy in MCI 
progression, and MCI subjects with high tau binding levels show an increase risk 
of longitudinal tau accumulation, atrophy, and cognitive decline. Trial

OBJECTIVE: To identify brain regions whose metabolic impairment contributes to 
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) clinical core features expression and to assess 
the influence of severity of global cognitive impairment on the DLB 
hypometabolic pattern.
METHODS: Brain fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography and information 
on core features were available in 171 patients belonging to the imaging 
repository of the European DLB Consortium. Principal component analysis was 
applied to identify brain regions relevant to the local data variance. A linear 
regression model was applied to generate core-feature-specific patterns 
controlling for the main confounding variables (Mini-Mental State Examination 
[MMSE], age, education, gender, and center). Regression analysis to the locally 
normalized intensities was performed to generate an MMSE-sensitive map.
RESULTS: Parkinsonism negatively covaried with bilateral parietal, precuneus, 
and anterior cingulate metabolism; visual hallucinations (VH) with bilateral 
dorsolateral-frontal cortex, posterior cingulate, and parietal metabolism; and 
rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) with bilateral 
parieto-occipital cortex, precuneus, and ventrolateral-frontal metabolism. VH 
and RBD shared a positive covariance with metabolism in the medial temporal 
lobe, cerebellum, brainstem, basal ganglia, thalami, and orbitofrontal and 
sensorimotor cortex. Cognitive fluctuations negatively covaried with occipital 
metabolism and positively with parietal lobe metabolism. MMSE positively 
covaried with metabolism in the left superior frontal gyrus, bilateral-parietal 
cortex, and left precuneus, and negatively with metabolism in the insula, medial 
frontal gyrus, hippocampus in the left hemisphere, and right cerebellum.
INTERPRETATION: Regions of more preserved metabolism are relatively consistent 
across the variegate DLB spectrum. By contrast, core features were associated 
with more prominent hypometabolism in specific regions, thus suggesting a close 
clinical-imaging correlation, reflecting the interplay between topography of 
neurodegeneration and clinical presentation in DLB patients. Ann Neurol

Studying the Manifold Structure of Alzheimer's Disease: A Deep Learning Approach 
Using Convolutional Autoencoders.

Martinez-Murcia FJ, Ortiz A, Gorriz JM, Ramirez J, Castillo-Barnes D.

Many classical machine learning techniques have been used to explore Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), evolving from image decomposition techniques such as principal 
component analysis toward higher complexity, non-linear decomposition 
algorithms. With the arrival of the deep learning paradigm, it has become 
possible to extract high-level abstract features directly from MRI images that 
internally describe the distribution of data in low-dimensional manifolds. In 
this work, we try a new exploratory data analysis of AD based on deep 
convolutional autoencoders. We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms 
and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of 
neuropsychological test outcomes, diagnoses, and other clinical data with the 
imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The 
distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then 
analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis, and the 
influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is 
estimated. The imaging-derived markers could then predict clinical variables 
with correlations above 0.6 in the case of neuropsychological evaluation 
variables such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores, achieving a classification 
accuracy over 80% for the diagnosis of AD.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives of the present study were to investigate (1) whether 
trinary visual interpretation of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) 
imaging (negative/equivocal/positive) reflects quantitative amyloid measurements 
and the time course of 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) amyloid accumulation, and 
(2) whether visually equivocal scans represent an early stage of the Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) continuum in terms of an intermediate state of quantitative amyloid 
measurements and the changes in amyloid accumulation over time.
METHODS: From the National Bioscience Database Center Human Database of the 
Japanese Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, we selected 133 
individuals for this study including 33 with Alzheimer's disease dementia (ADD), 
52 with late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and 48 cognitively normal (CN) 
subjects who underwent clinical assessment, PiB PET, and structural magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) with 2 or 3-years of follow-up. Sixty-eight of the 133 
individuals underwent cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β1-42 (CSF-Ab42) analysis at 
baseline. The standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) of PiB PET was calculated with 
a method using MRI at each visit. The cross-sectional values, longitudinal 
changes in SUVR, and baseline CSF-Ab42 were compared among groups, which were 
categorized based on trinary visual reads of amyloid PET 
(negative/equivocal/positive).
RESULTS: From the trinary visual interpretation of the PiB PET images, 55 
subjects were negative, 8 were equivocal, and 70 were positive. Negative 
interpretation was most frequent in the CN group (70.8/10.4/18.8%: 
negative/equivocal/positive), and positive was most frequent in the LMCI group 
(34.6/1.9/63.5%) and in the ADD group (9.1/6.1/84.8%). The baseline SUVRs were 
1.08 ± 0.06 in the negative group, 1.23 ± 0.15 in the equivocal group, and 
1.86 ± 0.31 in the positive group (F = 174.9, p < 0.001). The baseline CSF-Ab42 
level was 463 ± 112 pg/mL in the negative group, 383 ± 125 pg/mL in the 
equivocal group, and 264 ± 69 pg/mL in the positive group (F = 37, p < 0.001). 
Over the 3-year follow-up, annual changes in SUVR were - 0.00 ± 0.02 in the 
negative group, 0.02 ± 0.02 in the equivocal group, and 0.04 ± 0.07 in the 
positive group (F = 8.4, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Trinary visual interpretation (negative/equivocal/positive) of 
amyloid PET imaging reflects quantitative amyloid measurements evaluated with 
PET and the CSF amyloid test as well as the amyloid accumulation over time 
evaluated with PET over 3 years. Subjects in the early stage of the AD continuum 
could be identified with an equivocal scan, because they showed intermediate 
quantitative amyloid PET, CSF measurements, and the amyloid accumulation over 
time.

Neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and progressive 
forms of multiple sclerosis (MS), can affect the brainstem and are associated 
with atrophy that can be visualized by MRI. Anatomically accurate, large-scale 
assessments of brainstem atrophy are challenging due to lack of automated, 
accurate segmentation methods. We present a novel method for brainstem volumetry 
using a fully-automated segmentation approach based on multi-dimensional gated 
recurrent units (MD-GRU), a deep learning based semantic segmentation approach 
employing a convolutional adaptation of gated recurrent units. The neural 
network was trained on 67 3D-high resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from MS 
patients and healthy controls (HC) and refined using segmentations of 20 
independent MS patients' scans. Reproducibility was assessed in MR test-retest 
experiments in 33 HC. Accuracy and robustness were examined by Dice scores 
comparing MD-GRU to FreeSurfer and manual brainstem segmentations in independent 
MS and AD datasets. The mean %-change/SD between test-retest brainstem volumes 
were 0.45%/0.005 (MD-GRU), 0.95%/0.009 (FreeSurfer), 0.86%/0.007 (manually 
edited segmentations). Comparing MD-GRU to manually edited segmentations the 
mean Dice scores/SD were: 0.97/0.005 (brainstem), 0.95/0.013 (mesencephalon), 
0.98/0.006 (pons), 0.95/0.015 (medulla oblongata). Compared to the manual gold 
standard, MD-GRU brainstem segmentations were more accurate than FreeSurfer 
segmentations (p < .001). In the multi-centric acquired AD data, the mean Dice 
score/SD for the MD-GRU-manual segmentation comparison was 0.97/0.006. The fully 
automated brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU provides accurate, highly 
reproducible, and robust segmentations in HC and patients with MS and AD in 200 
s/scan on an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU and shows potential for application in 
large and longitudinal datasets.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Limited evidence has suggested that a deep learning 
automatic brain segmentation and classification method, based on T1-weighted 
brain MR images, can predict Alzheimer disease. Our aim was to develop and 
validate a deep learning-based automatic brain segmentation and classification 
algorithm for the diagnosis of Alzheimer disease using 3D T1-weighted brain MR 
images.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A deep learning-based algorithm was developed using a 
dataset of T1-weighted brain MR images in consecutive patients with Alzheimer 
disease and mild cognitive impairment. We developed a 2-step algorithm using a 
convolutional neural network to perform brain parcellation followed by 3 
classifier techniques including XGBoost for disease prediction. All 
classification experiments were performed using 5-fold cross-validation. The 
diagnostic performance of the XGBoost method was compared with logistic 
regression and a linear Support Vector Machine by calculating their areas under 
the curve for differentiating Alzheimer disease from mild cognitive impairment 
and mild cognitive impairment from healthy controls.
RESULTS: In a total of 4 datasets, 1099, 212, 711, and 705 eligible patients 
were included. Compared with the linear Support Vector Machine and logistic 
regression, XGBoost significantly improved the prediction of Alzheimer disease 
(P < .001). In terms of differentiating Alzheimer disease from mild cognitive 
impairment, the 3 algorithms resulted in areas under the curve of 0.758-0.825. 
XGBoost had a sensitivity of 68% and a specificity of 70%. In terms of 
differentiating mild cognitive impairment from the healthy control group, the 3 
algorithms resulted in areas under the curve of 0.668-0.870. XGBoost had a 
sensitivity of 79% and a specificity of 80%.
CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning-based automatic brain segmentation and 
classification algorithm allowed an accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer disease 
using T1-weighted brain MR images. The widespread availability of T1-weighted 
brain MR imaging suggests that this algorithm is a promising and widely 
applicable method for predicting Alzheimer disease.

The tropomyosin receptor kinase TrkA/B/C family is responsible for human 
neuronal growth, survival, and differentiation from early nervous system 
development stages onward. Downregulation of TrkA/B/C receptors characterizes 
numerous neurological disorders including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Abnormally 
expressed Trk receptors or chimeric Trk fusion proteins are also 
well-characterized oncogenic drivers in a variety of neurogenic and 
non-neurogenic human neoplasms and are currently the focus of intensive clinical 
research. Previously, we have described the clinical translation of a highly 
selective and potent carbon-11-labeled pan-Trk radioligand and the preclinical 
characterization of the optimized fluorine-18-labeled analogue, [18F]TRACK, for 
in vivo Trk positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. We describe herein 
central nervous system selectivity assessment and first-in-human study of 
[18F]TRACK.

Early diagnosis is playing an important role in preventing progress of the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper proposes to improve the prediction of AD 
with a deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN), which can show generic 
features capturing AD biomarkers extracted from brain images, adapt to different 
domain datasets, and accurately classify subjects with improved fine-tuning 
method. The 3D-CNN is built upon a convolutional autoencoder, which is 
pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans 
for source domain. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then 
fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification in target domain. In this 
paper, deep supervision algorithm is used to improve the performance of already 
proposed 3D Adaptive CNN. Experiments on the ADNI MRI dataset without 
skull-stripping preprocessing have shown that the proposed 3D Deeply Supervised 
Adaptable CNN outperforms several proposed approaches, including 3D-CNN model, 
other CNN-based methods and conventional classifiers by accuracy and robustness. 
Abilities of the proposed network to generalize the features learnt and adapt to 
other domains have been validated on the CADDementia dataset.

In order to predict the risks of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) based on the deep 
learning model of brain 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET), a total of 
350 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) participants from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were selected as the research objects; 
in addition, the Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding (CAFFE) 
was selected as the framework of the deep learning platform; the FDG PET image 
features of each participant were extracted by a deep convolution network model 
to construct the prediction and classification models; therefore, the MCI stage 
features were classified and the transformation was predicted. The results 
showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction, the sensitivity and 
specificity of conv3 classification were respectively 91.02% and 77.63%; in 
terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) and Early Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (EMCI) classification, the accuracy of conv5 classification was 
72.19%, and the sensitivity and specificity of conv5 were all 73% approximately. 
Thus, it was seen that the model constructed in the research could be used to 
solve the problems of MCI transformation prediction, which also had certain 
effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of AD based 
on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research 
matched the expected results. It provided a relatively accurate reference model 
for the prediction of AD. Despite the deficiencies of the research process, the 
research results have provided certain references and guidance for the future 
exploration of accurate AD prediction model; therefore, the research is of great 
significance.

The neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) has shown its effectiveness in recent years. In general, the multimodal 
neuroimaging-based CAD always outperforms the approaches based on a single 
modality. However, single-modal neuroimaging is more favored in clinical 
practice for diagnosis due to the limitations of imaging devices, especially in 
rural hospitals. Learning using privileged information (LUPI) is a new learning 
paradigm that adopts additional privileged information (PI) modality to help to 
train a more effective learning model during the training stage, but PI itself 
is not available in the testing stage. Since PI is generally related to the 
training samples, it is then transferred to the learned model. In this work, a 
LUPI-based CAD framework for AD is proposed. It can flexibly perform a 
classifier- or feature-level LUPI, in which the information is transferred from 
the additional PI modality to the diagnosis modality. A thorough comparison has 
been made among three classifier-level algorithms and five feature-level LUPI 
algorithms. The experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that all 
classifier-level and deep learning based feature-level LUPI algorithms can 
improve the performance of a single-modal neuroimaging-based CAD for AD by 
transferring PI. Graphical abstract Graphical abstract for the framework of the 
LUPI-based CAD for AD.

Purpose To reduce radiotracer requirements for amyloid PET/MRI without 
sacrificing diagnostic quality by using deep learning methods. Materials and 
Methods Forty data sets from 39 patients (mean age ± standard deviation [SD], 67 
years ± 8), including 16 male patients and 23 female patients (mean age, 66 
years ± 6 and 68 years ± 9, respectively), who underwent simultaneous amyloid 
(fluorine 18 [18F]-florbetaben) PET/MRI examinations were acquired from March 
2016 through October 2017 and retrospectively analyzed. One hundredth of the raw 
list-mode PET data were randomly chosen to simulate a low-dose (1%) acquisition. 
Convolutional neural networks were implemented with low-dose PET and multiple MR 
images (PET-plus-MR model) or with low-dose PET alone (PET-only) as inputs to 
predict full-dose PET images. Quality of the synthesized images was evaluated 
while Bland-Altman plots assessed the agreement of regional standard uptake 
value ratios (SUVRs) between image types. Two readers scored image quality on a 
five-point scale (5 = excellent) and determined amyloid status (positive or 
negative). Statistical analyses were carried out to assess the difference of 
image quality metrics and reader agreement and to determine confidence intervals 
(CIs) for reading results. Results The synthesized images (especially from the 
PET-plus-MR model) showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared 
with the low-dose image. All PET-plus-MR images scored 3 or higher, with 
proportions of images rated greater than 3 similar to those for the full-dose 
images (-10% difference [eight of 80 readings], 95% CI: -15%, -5%). Accuracy for 
amyloid status was high (71 of 80 readings [89%]) and similar to intrareader 
reproducibility of full-dose images (73 of 80 [91%]). The PET-plus-MR model also 
had the smallest mean and variance for SUVR difference to full-dose images. 
Conclusion Simultaneously acquired MRI and ultra-low-dose PET data can be used 
to synthesize full-dose-like amyloid PET images. © RSNA, 2018 Online

Network analysis can provide insight into key organizational principles of brain 
structure and help identify structural changes associated with brain disease. 
Though static differences between diseased and healthy networks are well 
characterized, the study of network dynamics, or how brain networks change over 
time, is increasingly central to understanding ongoing brain changes throughout 
disease. Accordingly, we present a short review of network models of spread, 
network dynamics, and network degeneration. Borrowing from recent suggestions, 
we divide this review into two processes by which brain networks can change: 
dynamics on networks, which are functional and pathological consequences taking 
place atop a static structural brain network; and dynamics of networks, which 
constitutes a changing structural brain network. We focus on diffusion magnetic 
resonance imaging-based structural or anatomic connectivity graphs. We address 
psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia; developmental disorders like epilepsy; 
stroke; and Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases.

Detection and diagnosis of early and subclinical stages of Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD) play an essential role in the implementation of intervention and prevention 
strategies. Neuroimaging techniques predominantly provide insight into anatomic 
structure changes associated with AD. Deep learning methods have been 
extensively applied towards creating and evaluating models capable of 
differentiating between cognitively unimpaired, patients with Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Several published approaches apply information 
fusion techniques, providing ways of combining several input sources in the 
medical domain, which contributes to knowledge of broader and enriched quality. 
The aim of this paper is to fuse sociodemographic data such as age, marital 
status, education and gender, and genetic data (presence of an apolipoprotein E 
(APOE)-ε4 allele) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This enables 
enriched multi-modal features, that adequately represent the MRI scan visually 
and is adopted for creating and modeling classification systems capable of 
detecting amnestic MCI (aMCI). To fully utilize the potential of deep 
convolutional neural networks, two extra color layers denoting contrast 
intensified and blurred image adaptations are virtually augmented to each MRI 
scan, completing the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color channels. Deep convolutional 
activation features (DeCAF) are extracted from the average pooling layer of the 
deep learning system Inception_v3. These features from the fused MRI scans are 
used as visual representation for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based 
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification model. The proposed approach is 
evaluated on a sub-study containing 120 participants (aMCI = 61 and cognitively 
unimpaired = 59) of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study with a baseline model 
accuracy of 76%. Further evaluation was conducted on the ADNI Phase 1 dataset 
with 624 participants (aMCI = 397 and cognitively unimpaired = 227) with a 
baseline model accuracy of 66.27%. Experimental results show that the proposed 
approach achieves 90% accuracy and 0.90 F1-Score at classification of aMCI vs. 
cognitively unimpaired participants on the HNR Study dataset, and 77% accuracy 
and 0.83 F1-Score on the ADNI dataset.

For effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to identify 
subjects who are most likely to exhibit rapid cognitive decline. We aimed to 
develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional 
neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using flurodeoxyglucose and florbetapir 
positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 
patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 
3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined 
image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined 
region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used 
minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly 
used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects 
was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of 
mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based 
quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2%) for conversion to AD in 
MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. 
ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly 
higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p < 0.05). Output 
scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in 
cognitive measurements (p < 0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep 
learning as a practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker.

The classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using deep learning methods has 
shown promising results, but successful application in clinical settings 
requires a combination of high accuracy, short processing time, and 
generalizability to various populations. In this study, we developed a 
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD classification algorithm using 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from AD patients and age/gender-matched 
cognitively normal controls from two populations that differ in ethnicity and 
education level. These populations come from the Seoul National University 
Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). 
For each population, we trained CNNs on five subsets using coronal slices of 
T1-weighted images that cover the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated the models 
on validation subsets from both the same population (within-dataset validation) 
and other population (between-dataset validation). Our models achieved average 
areas under the curves of 0.91-0.94 for within-dataset validation and 0.88-0.89 
for between-dataset validation. The mean processing time per person was 23-24 s. 
The within-dataset and between-dataset performances were comparable between the 
ADNI-derived and SNUBH-derived models. These results demonstrate the 
generalizability of our models to different patients with different ethnicities 
and education levels, as well as their potential for deployment as fast and 
accurate diagnostic support tools for AD.

Disrupted cholinergic neurotransmission plays a central role in Alzheimer's 
disease, medication-induced memory impairment, and delirium. At the systems 
level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the activity and interplay 
of anatomically distributed neural networks critical for memory function. Using 
a network-sensitive imaging technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a 
double-blind, crossover design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic 
drug administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in a 
group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose scopolamine (0.2 
mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and selectively decreased 
connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks. Both memory and connectivity 
effects were independent of β-amyloid burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes 
within the Default and Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength 
of anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully 
statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance. These 
results provide experimental support for the importance of the Default and 
Salience networks to memory performance and suggest scopolamine-induced amnesia 
is underpinned by disrupted connectivity within and between these 2 networks. 
More broadly, these results support the potential utility of fcMRI as tool 
examine the systems-level pharmacology of psychoactive drugs.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical amyloid quantification on PET by using the 
standardized uptake value ratio is valuable for research studies and clinical 
trials in Alzheimer disease. However, it is resource intensive, requiring 
co-registered MR imaging data and specialized segmentation software. We 
investigated the use of deep learning to automatically quantify standardized 
uptake value ratio and used this for classification.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
dataset, we identified 2582 18F-florbetapir PET scans, which were separated into 
positive and negative cases by using a standardized uptake value ratio threshold 
of 1.1. We trained convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50 and ResNet-152) to 
predict standardized uptake value ratio and classify amyloid status. We assessed 
performance based on network depth, number of PET input slices, and use of 
ImageNet pretraining. We also assessed human performance with 3 readers in a 
subset of 100 randomly selected cases.
RESULTS: We have found that 48% of cases were amyloid positive. The best 
performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before classification, 3 
input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized uptake value ratio 
root-mean-square error of 0.054, corresponding to 95.1% correct amyloid status 
prediction. Using more than 3 slices did not improve performance, but ImageNet 
initialization did. The best trained network was more accurate than humans (96% 
versus a mean of 88%, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning algorithms can estimate standardized uptake value 
ratio and use this to classify 18F-florbetapir PET scans. Such methods have 
promise to automate this laborious calculation, enabling quantitative 
measurements rapidly and in settings without extensive image processing manpower 
and expertise.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to describe clinical features, [18 
F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) metabolism and 
digital pathology in patients with logopenic progressive aphasia (LPA) and 
pathologic diagnosis of diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD) and compare to patients 
with LPA with other pathologies, as well as patients with classical features of 
probable dementia with Lewy bodies (pDLB).
METHODS: This is a clinicopathologic case-control study of 45 patients, 
including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were 
diagnosed with LPA-DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared FDG-PET 
metabolism in LPA-DLBD to an independent group of patients with clinical pDLB 
and regional α-synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent 
group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and antemortem pDLB (DLB-DLBD).
RESULTS: All patients with LPA-DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and 
neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA-DLBD, LPA-Alzheimer's 
disease (LPA-AD), and LPA-frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA-FTLD). Genetic 
screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked genes were negative with the exception of 
APOE ε4 allele present in 83% of LPA-DLBD patients. Seventy-five percent of the 
patients with LPA-DLBD showed a parietal-dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; 
LPA-FTLD - temporal-dominant pattern, whereas LPA-AD showed heterogeneous 
patterns of hypometabolism. LPA-DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism 
affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the 
nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA-DLBD had minimal 
atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts, and higher 
α-synuclein burden in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared 
to DLB-DLBD.
INTERPRETATION: Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, 
DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to 
α-synuclein-associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe. ANN

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between β-amyloid (Aβ) load and 
postmortem structural network topology in decedents without dementia.
METHODS: Fourteen decedents (mean age at death 72.6 ± 7.2 years) without known 
clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative disease and meeting pathology criteria 
only for no or low Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologic change were selected from 
the Normal Aging Brain Collection Amsterdam database. In situ brain MRI included 
3D T1-weighted images for anatomical registration and diffusion tensor imaging 
for probabilistic tractography with subsequent structural network construction. 
Network topologic measures of centrality (degree), integration (global 
efficiency), and segregation (clustering and local efficiency) were calculated. 
Tissue sections from 12 cortical regions were sampled and immunostained for Aβ 
and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau), and histopathologic burden was determined. 
Linear mixed effect models were used to assess the relationship between Aβ and 
p-tau load and network topologic measures.
RESULTS: Aβ was present in 79% of cases and predominantly consisted of diffuse 
plaques; p-tau was sparsely present. Linear mixed effect models showed 
independent negative associations between Aβ load and global efficiency (β = 
-0.83 × 10-3, p = 0.014), degree (β = -0.47, p = 0.034), and clustering (β = 
-0.55 × 10-2, p = 0.043). A positive association was present between Aβ load and 
local efficiency (β = 3.16 × 10-3, p = 0.035). Regionally, these results were 
significant in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) for degree (β = -2.22, p < 
0.001) and local efficiency (β = 1.01 × 10-2, p = 0.014) and precuneus for 
clustering (β = -0.91 × 10-2, p = 0.017). There was no relationship between 
p-tau and network topology.
CONCLUSION: This study in deceased adults with AD-related pathologic change 
provides evidence for a relationship among early Aβ accumulation, predominantly 
of the diffuse type, and structural network topology, specifically of the PCC 
and precuneus.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by progressive loss of memory and general decline in cognitive 
functions. Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI provide useful 
information for the classification of patients on the basis of brain biomarkers. 
Recently, CNN methods have emerged as powerful tools to improve classification 
using images.
NEW METHOD: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain scans 
focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal region. The 
network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon which models are 
built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis. We evaluated various 
types of transfer learning through the following mechanisms: (i) cross-modal 
(sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a 
hybrid transfer learning of both types.
RESULTS: Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and with a 
limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases accuracy with more 
than 5 points for the most difficult classification tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and 
MCI/NC.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Our methodology provides good accuracy scores 
for classification over a shallow convolutional network. Besides, we focused 
only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal region, where few slices are 
selected to feed the network. Also, we used cross-modal transfer learning.
CONCLUSIONS: Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow CNN 
network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to significant results 
even if the model is trained on small datasets, which is often the case in 
medical image analysis.

Advances in drug discovery and diverse radiochemical methodologies have led to 
the discovery of novel positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracers used to 
image the GABAergic system, shaping our fundamental understanding of a variety 
of brain health illnesses, including epilepsy, stroke, cerebral palsy, 
schizophrenia, autism, Alzheimer's disease, and addictions. In this Viewpoint, 
we review the state-of-the art of PET imaging with radiotracers that target the 
GABAA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, challenges and opportunities for imaging 
GABAB receptors and GABA transporters, and highlight an ongoing need to develop 
more sensitive radiotracers for imaging GABA release in the central nervous 
system.

Purpose: To perform automatic assessment of dementia severity using a deep 
learning framework applied to resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (rs-fMRI) data. Method: We divided 133 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients 
with clinical dementia rating (CDR) scores from 0.5 to 3 into two groups based 
on dementia severity; the groups with very mild/mild (CDR: 0.5-1) and moderate 
to severe (CDR: 2-3) dementia consisted of 77 and 56 subjects, respectively. We 
used rs-fMRI to extract functional connectivity features, calculated using 
independent component analysis (ICA), and performed automated severity 
classification with three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) 
based on deep learning. Results: The mean balanced classification accuracy was 
0.923 ± 0.042 (p < 0.001) with a specificity of 0.946 ± 0.019 and sensitivity of 
0.896 ± 0.077. The rs-fMRI data indicated that the medial frontal, sensorimotor, 
executive control, dorsal attention, and visual related networks mainly 
correlated with dementia severity. Conclusions: Our CDR-based novel 
classification using rs-fMRI is an acceptable objective severity indicator. In 
the absence of trained neuropsychologists, dementia severity can be objectively 
and accurately classified using a 3D-deep learning framework with rs-fMRI 
independent components.

OBJECTIVE: Accurate diagnosis of early Alzheimer disease (AD) plays a critical 
role in preventing the progression of memory impairment. We aimed to develop a 
new deep belief network (DBN) framework using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
positron emission tomography (PET) metabolic imaging to identify patients at the 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage with presymptomatic AD and to discriminate 
them from other patients with MCI.
METHODS: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET images of 109 patients recruited in the 
ongoing longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were 
included in this analysis. Patients were grouped into 2 classes: (1) stable mild 
cognitive impairment (n = 62) or (2) progressive mild cognitive impairment (n = 
47). Our framework is composed of 4 steps: (1) image preprocessing: 
normalization and smoothing; (2) identification of regions of interest (ROIs); 
(3) feature learning using deep neural networks; and (4) classification by 
support vector machine with 3 kernels. All classification experiments were 
performed with a 5-fold cross-validation. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity 
were used to validate the results.
RESULT: A total of 1103 ROIs were obtained. One hundred features were learned 
from ROIs using the DBN. The classification accuracy using linear, polynomial, 
and RBF kernels was 83.9%, 79.2%, and 86.6%, respectively. This method may be a 
powerful tool for personalized precision medicine in the population with 
prediction of early AD progression.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with 
progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic 
resonance images (MRI) play important role to evaluate the brain anatomical 
changes for AD Diagnosis. Machine learning technologies have been widely studied 
on MRI computation and analysis for quantitative evaluation and 
computer-aided-diagnosis of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft 
features after image processing such as registration and segmentation, and then 
train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. Motivated by 
the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a 
classification method based on multiple cluster dense convolutional neural 
networks (DenseNets) to learn the various local features of MR brain images, 
which are combined for AD classification. First, we partition the whole brain 
image into different local regions and extract a number of 3D patches from each 
region. Second, the patches from each region are grouped into different clusters 
with the K-Means clustering method. Third, we construct a DenseNet to learn the 
patch features for each cluster and the features learned from the discriminative 
clusters of each region are ensembled for classification. Finally, the 
classification results from different local regions are combined to enhance 
final image classification. The proposed method can gradually learn the MRI 
features from the local patches to global image level for the classification 
task. There are no rigid registration and segmentation required for 
preprocessing MRI images. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted MRIs of 831 
subjects including 199 AD patients, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 229 
normal control (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an 
accuracy of 89.5% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.4% for AD vs. NC 
classification, and an accuracy of 73.8% and an AUC of 77.5% for MCI vs. NC 
classification, demonstrating the promising classification performances.

OBJECTIVES: It remains difficult to characterize the source of pain in knee 
joints either using radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). We sought 
to determine if advanced machine learning methods such as deep neural networks 
could distinguish knees with pain from those without it and identify the 
structural features that are associated with knee pain.
METHODS: We constructed a convolutional Siamese network to associate MRI scans 
obtained on subjects from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) with frequent 
unilateral knee pain comparing the knee with frequent pain to the contralateral 
knee without pain. The Siamese network architecture enabled pairwise learning of 
information from two-dimensional (2D) sagittal intermediate-weighted turbo spin 
echo slices obtained from similar locations on both knees. Class activation 
mapping (CAM) was utilized to create saliency maps, which highlighted the 
regions most associated with knee pain. The MRI scans and the CAMs of each 
subject were reviewed by an expert radiologist to identify the presence of 
abnormalities within the model-predicted regions of high association.
RESULTS: Using 10-fold cross-validation, our model achieved an area under curve 
(AUC) value of 0.808. When individuals whose knee WOMAC pain scores were not 
discordant were excluded, model performance increased to 0.853. The radiologist 
review revealed that about 86% of the cases that were predicted correctly had 
effusion-synovitis within the regions that were most associated with pain.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a proof of principle that deep learning can 
be applied to assess knee pain from MRI scans.
KEY POINTS: • Our article is the first to leverage a deep learning framework to 
associate MR images of the knee with knee pain. • We developed a convolutional 
Siamese network that had the ability to fuse information from multiple 
two-dimensional (2D) MRI slices from the knee with pain and the contralateral 
knee of the same individual without pain to predict unilateral knee pain. • Our 
model achieved an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.808. When individuals who 
had WOMAC pain scores that were not discordant for knees (pain discordance < 3) 
were excluded, model performance increased to 0.853.

INTRODUCTION: Quantitative in vivo measurement of brain amyloid burden is 
important for both research and clinical purposes. However, the existence of 
multiple imaging tracers presents challenges to the interpretation of such 
measurements. This study presents a direct comparison of Pittsburgh compound 
B-based and florbetapir-based amyloid imaging in the same participants from two 
independent cohorts using a crossover design.
METHODS: Pittsburgh compound B and florbetapir amyloid PET imaging data from 
three different cohorts were analyzed using previously established pipelines to 
obtain global amyloid burden measurements. These measurements were converted to 
the Centiloid scale to allow fair comparison between the two tracers. The mean 
and inter-individual variability of the two tracers were compared using 
multivariate linear models both cross-sectionally and longitudinally.
RESULTS: Global amyloid burden measured using the two tracers were strongly 
correlated in both cohorts. However, higher variability was observed when 
florbetapir was used as the imaging tracer. The variability may be partially 
caused by white matter signal as partial volume correction reduces the 
variability and improves the correlations between the two tracers. Amyloid 
burden measured using both tracers was found to be in association with clinical 
and psychometric measurements. Longitudinal comparison of the two tracers was 
also performed in similar but separate cohorts whose baseline amyloid load was 
considered elevated (i.e., amyloid positive). No significant difference was 
detected in the average annualized rate of change measurements made with these 
two tracers.
DISCUSSION: Although the amyloid burden measurements were quite similar using 
these two tracers as expected, difference was observable even after conversion 
into the Centiloid scale. Further investigation is warranted to identify optimal 
strategies to harmonize amyloid imaging data acquired using different tracers.

We performed this research to 1) evaluate a novel deep learning method for the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 2) jointly predict the Mini Mental 
State Examination (MMSE) scores of South Korean patients with AD. Using 
resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) scans of 331 
participants, we obtained functional 3-dimensional (3-D) independent component 
spatial maps for use as features in classification and regression tasks. A 3-D 
convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was developed for the 
classification task. MMSE scores were predicted using: linear least square 
regression (LLSR), support vector regression, bagging-based ensemble regression, 
and tree regression with group independent component analysis (gICA) features. 
To improve MMSE regression performance, we applied feature optimization methods 
including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector 
machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The mean balanced test 
accuracy was 85.27% for the classification of AD versus healthy controls. The 
medial visual, default mode, dorsal attention, executive, and auditory related 
networks were mainly associated with AD. The maximum clinical MMSE score 
prediction accuracy with the LLSR method applied on gICA combined with SVM-RFE 
features had the lowest root mean square error (3.27 ± 0.58) and the highest R2 
value (0.63 ± 0.02). Classification of AD and healthy controls can be 
successfully achieved using only rs-fMRI and MMSE scores can be accurately 
predicted using functional independent component features. In the absence of 
trained clinicians, AD disease status and clinical MMSE scores can be jointly 
predicted using 3-D deep learning and regression learning approaches with 
rs-fMRI data.

Patches from three orthogonal views of selected cerebral regions can be utilized 
to learn convolutional neural network (CNN) models for staging the Alzheimer 
disease (AD) spectrum including preclinical AD, mild cognitive impairment due to 
AD, and dementia due to AD and normal controls. Hippocampi, amygdalae and 
insulae were selected from the volumetric analysis of structured magnetic 
resonance images (MRIs). Three-view patches (TVPs) from these regions were fed 
to the CNN for training. MRIs were classified with the SoftMax-normalized scores 
of individual model predictions on TVPs. The significance of each region of 
interest (ROI) for staging the AD spectrum was evaluated and reported. The 
results of the ensemble classifier are compared with state-of-the-art methods 
using the same evaluation metrics. Patch-based ROI ensembles provide comparable 
diagnostic performance for AD staging. In this work, TVP-based ROI analysis 
using a CNN provides informative landmarks in cerebral MRIs and may have 
significance in clinical studies and computer-aided diagnosis system design.

OBJECTIVE: The longitudinal association of the blood biomarkers total tau 
(t-tau), neurofilament light (Nf-L), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) 
with common sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) and cognitive decline is not 
established.
METHODS: Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays 
for serum concentrations of t-tau, Nf-L, and GFAP were measured in a population 
sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a 
clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in-home cognitive assessments, and had 
undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging.
RESULTS: Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the 
development of clinical AD; especially, the time-specific associations were 
notable: t-tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf-L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical 
AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 
16 years; baseline t-tau > 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf-L > 25.5pg/ml 
had 110% faster decline, and GFAP > 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to 
those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP > 232pg/ml showed 
160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values 
< 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t-tau was associated with faster 
increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf-L and GFAP were associated 
with faster decline in cortical thickness.
INTERPRETATION: Serum t-tau, Nf-L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic 
AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, 
suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but 
also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia. ANN NEUROL

Non-rigid cortical registration is an important and challenging task due to the 
geometric complexity of the human cortex and the high degree of inter-subject 
variability. A conventional solution is to use a spherical representation of 
surface properties and perform registration by aligning cortical folding 
patterns in that space. This strategy produces accurate spatial alignment, but 
often requires high computational cost. Recently, convolutional neural networks 
(CNNs) have demonstrated the potential to dramatically speed up volumetric 
registration. However, due to distortions introduced by projecting a sphere to a 
2D plane, a direct application of recent learning-based methods to surfaces 
yields poor results. In this study, we present SphereMorph, a diffeomorphic 
registration framework for cortical surfaces using deep networks that addresses 
these issues. SphereMorph uses a UNet-style network associated with a spherical 
kernel to learn the displacement field and warps the sphere using a modified 
spatial transformer layer. We propose a resampling weight in computing the data 
fitting loss to account for distortions introduced by polar projection, and 
demonstrate the performance of our proposed method on two tasks, including 
cortical parcellation and group-wise functional area alignment. The experiments 
show that the proposed SphereMorph is capable of modeling the geometric 
registration problem in a CNN framework and demonstrate superior registration 
accuracy and computational efficiency. The source code of SphereMorph will be 
released to the public upon acceptance of this manuscript at

OBJECTIVE: Digital brain template and atlas designed for a specific group 
provide advantages for the analysis and interpretation of neuroimaging data, but 
require a significant workload for development. We developed a simple method to 
create customized brain atlas for diffeomorphic anatomical registration through 
exponentiated lie algebra (DARTEL) tool using FreeSurfer-generated 
volume-of-interest (FSVOI) images and validated.
METHODS: 18F-florbetaben positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance (MR) imaging data were obtained from 248 participants of Alzheimer's 
disease spectrum (from cognitively normal to Alzheimer's disease dementia). To 
create a customized atlas, MR images of 84 amyloid-negative controls were first 
processed with FreeSurfer to obtain individual FSVOI and with DARTEL tool to 
create DARTEL template. Individual FSVOI images were spatially normalized, and 
each voxel was then labelled with a VOI label with maximum probability. Using 
these template and atlas, all images were normalized, and the regional 
standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were measured.
RESULTS: 18F-florbetaben SUVR values measured with customized atlas showed 
excellent one-to-one correlation with SUVR measured with individual FSVOI in all 
regions, and thereby showed almost identical between-group comparison results 
and outperformed the classic methods.
CONCLUSIONS: Customized FreeSurfer-based brain atlas for DARTEL tool is easy to 
create and useful for the analysis of PET and MR images with high adaptability 
and reliability for broad research purposes.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a difficult to diagnose pathology of the 
brain that progressively impairs cognitive functions. Computer-assisted 
diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging tool to support AD 
diagnosis. In this article, we explore the application of Supervised Switching 
Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD classification using only one structural 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder 
architectures, combining unsupervised representation and supervised 
classification as one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of 
SSAs to capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease 
semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to disease 
state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based approach.
METHODS: Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches extracted 
from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal 
anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative locations, exploring 
different patch sizes and network parameterizations. Then, models perform binary 
class prediction - healthy (CDR = 0) or AD-demented (CDR > 0) - on test data at 
patch level. The final subject classification is performed employing a majority 
rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition, relevant regions are 
identified, by computing accuracy densities from patch-level predictions, and 
analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional definitions.
RESULTS: Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per subject show 
that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely on full volumetric 
information and feature-engineered representations. SSAs classification accuracy 
on slices extracted along the Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes 
from a balanced cohort of 40 independent test subjects was 87.5%, 90.0%, and 
90.0%, respectively. A top sensitivity of 95.0% on both Coronal and Sagittal 
planes was also obtained.
CONCLUSIONS: SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among previous 
classification proposals, including feature-engineered and feature learning 
based methods, using only one scan slice per subject, instead of the whole 3D 
volume, as it is conventionally done. In addition, regions identified as 
relevant by SSAs' were, in most part, coherent or partially coherent in regard 
to relevant regions reported on previous works. These regions were also 
associated with findings from medical knowledge, which gives value to our 
methodology as a potential analytical aid for disease understanding.

OBJECTIVE: The study of cortical gyrification in Alzheimer's disease (AD) could 
help to further understanding of the changes undergone in the brain during 
neurodegeneration. Here, we aimed to study brain gyrification differences 
between healthy controls (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients, and AD 
patients, and explore how cerebral gyrification patterns were associated with 
memory and other cognitive functions.
METHODS: We applied surface-based morphometry techniques in 2 large, independent 
cross-sectional samples, obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative project. Both samples, encompassing a total of 1,270 participants, 
were analyzed independently.
RESULTS: Unexpectedly, we found that AD patients presented a more gyrificated 
entorhinal cortex than HC. Conversely, the insular cortex of AD patients was 
hypogyrificated. A decrease in the gyrification of the insular cortex was also 
found in older HC participants as compared with younger HC, which argues against 
the specificity of this finding in AD. However, an increased degree of folding 
of the insular cortex was specifically associated with better memory function 
and semantic fluency, only in AD patients. Overall, MCI patients presented an 
intermediate gyrification pattern. All these findings were consistently observed 
in the two samples.
INTERPRETATION: The marked atrophy of the medial temporal lobe observed in AD 
patients may explain the increased folding of the entorhinal cortex. We 
additionally speculate regarding alternative mechanisms that may also alter its 
folding. The association between increased gyrification of the insular cortex 
and memory function, specifically observed in AD, could be suggestive of 
compensatory mechanisms to overcome the loss of memory function. ANN NEUROL 2020

BACKGROUND: High-resolution medical images that include facial regions can be 
used to recognize the subject's face when reconstructing 3-dimensional 
(3D)-rendered images from 2-dimensional (2D) sequential images, which might 
constitute a risk of infringement of personal information when sharing data. 
According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) 
privacy rules, full-face photographic images and any comparable image are direct 
identifiers and considered as protected health information. Moreover, the 
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) categorizes facial images as biometric 
data and stipulates that special restrictions should be placed on the processing 
of biometric data.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop software that can remove the header 
information from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format 
files and facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) at the 2D sliced-image level to 
anonymize personal information in medical images.
METHODS: A total of 240 cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to 
train the deep learning model (144, 48, and 48 for the training, validation, and 
test sets, respectively, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
[ADNI] database). To overcome the small sample size problem, we used a data 
augmentation technique to create 576 images per epoch. We used attention-gated 
U-net for the basic structure of our deep learning model. To validate the 
performance of the software, we adapted an external test set comprising 100 
cranial MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) 
database.
RESULTS: The facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) were successfully detected 
and anonymized in both test sets (48 from ADNI and 100 from OASIS). Each result 
was manually validated in both the 2D image plane and the 3D-rendered images. 
Furthermore, the ADNI test set was verified using Microsoft Azure's face 
recognition artificial intelligence service. By adding a user interface, we 
developed and distributed (via GitHub) software named "Deface program" for 
medical images as an open-source project.
CONCLUSIONS: We developed deep learning-based software for the anonymization of 
MR images that distorts the eyes, nose, and ears to prevent facial 
identification of the subject in reconstructed 3D images. It could be used to 
share medical big data for secondary research while making both data providers 
and recipients compliant with the relevant privacy regulations.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of 
antemortem 11 C-Pittsburgh compound B (PIB) and 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) 
positron emission tomography (PET) versus autopsy diagnosis in a heterogenous 
sample of patients.
METHODS: One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and 
neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by 3 raters 
blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for 
cortical retention, whereas FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer disease 
(AD) or non-AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research 
criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate-high AD 
neuropathological change (ADNC).
RESULTS: One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2 years, 41 
females, Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET-to-autopsy interval = 
4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 showed non-AD 
neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]), and 13 
showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for 
detecting intermediate-high ADNC (96%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 89-100% vs 
80%, 95% CI = 68-92%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86%, 95% CI = 
76-95% vs 84%, 95% CI = 74-93%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and 
FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% (95% CI = 92-100%) and 
specificity was 98% (95% CI = 93-100%). Nine of 24 patients with incongruent 
reads were found to have co-occurrence of AD and non-AD pathologies.
INTERPRETATION: In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive impairment, 
PIB-PET had higher sensitivity than FDG-PET for intermediate-high ADNC, with 
similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and 
specificity approach 100%, whereas mixed pathology should be considered when PIB 
and FDG are incongruent. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:389-401.

Neuroanatomical segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain is 
a prerequisite for quantitative volume, thickness, and shape measurements, as 
well as an important intermediate step in many preprocessing pipelines. This 
work introduces a new highly accurate and versatile method based on 3D 
convolutional neural networks for the automatic segmentation of neuroanatomy in 
T1-weighted MRI. In combination with a deep 3D fully convolutional architecture, 
efficient linear registration-derived spatial priors are used to incorporate 
additional spatial context into the network. An aggressive data augmentation 
scheme using random elastic deformations is also used to regularize the 
networks, allowing for excellent performance even in cases where only limited 
labeled training data are available. Applied to hippocampus segmentation in an 
elderly population (mean Dice coefficient = 92.1%) and subcortical segmentation 
in a healthy adult population (mean Dice coefficient = 89.5%), we demonstrate 
new state-of-the-art accuracies and a high robustness to outliers. Further 
validation on a multistructure segmentation task in a scan-rescan dataset 
demonstrates accuracy (mean Dice coefficient = 86.6%) similar to the scan-rescan 
reliability of expert manual segmentations (mean Dice coefficient = 86.9%), and 
improved reliability compared to both expert manual segmentations and automated 
segmentations using FIRST. Furthermore, our method maintains a highly 
competitive runtime performance (e.g., requiring only 10 s for left/right 
hippocampal segmentation in 1 × 1 × 1 mm3 MNI stereotaxic space), orders of 
magnitude faster than conventional multiatlas segmentation methods.

PURPOSE: Visual reading of 18F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) 
scans is used in the diagnostic process of patients with cognitive disorders for 
assessment of amyloid-ß (Aß) depositions. However, this can be time-consuming, 
and difficult in case of borderline amyloid pathology. Computer-aided pattern 
recognition can be helpful in this process but needs to be validated. The aim of 
this work was to develop, train, validate and test a convolutional neural 
network (CNN) for discriminating between Aß negative and positive 
18F-florbetapir PET scans in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD).
METHODS: 18F-florbetapir PET images were acquired and visually assessed. The SCD 
cohort consisted of 133 patients from the SCIENCe cohort and 22 patients from 
the ADNI database. From the SCIENCe cohort, standardized uptake value ratio 
(SUVR) images were computed. From the ADNI database, SUVR images were extracted. 
2D CNNs (axial, coronal and sagittal) were built to capture features of the 
scans. The SCIENCe scans were randomly divided into training and validation set 
(5-fold cross-validation), and the ADNI scans were used as test set. Performance 
was evaluated based on average accuracy, sensitivity and specificity from the 
cross-validation. Next, the best performing CNN was evaluated on the test set.
RESULTS: The sagittal 2D-CNN classified the SCIENCe scans with the highest 
average accuracy of 99% ± 2 (SD), sensitivity of 97% ± 7 and specificity of 
100%. The ADNI scans were classified with a 95% accuracy, 100% sensitivity and 
92.3% specificity.
CONCLUSION: The 2D-CNN algorithm can classify Aß negative and positive 
18F-florbetapir PET scans with high performance in SCD patients.

Previously, we described how patients with new-onset Alzheimer's disease were 
differentiated from healthy, normal subjects to 100% accuracy, based on the 
amplitudes of the nonrhythmic back-projected independent components of the P300 
peak at the electroencephalogram electrodes and their latency in the response to 
an oddball, auditory evoked potential paradigm. A neural network and a voting 
strategy were used for classification. Here, we consider instead the statistical 
distribution functions of their latencies and amplitudes and suggest that the 
2-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test based upon their latency distribution functions 
offers an alternative biomarker for AD, with their amplitude distribution at the 
frontal electrode fp2 as possibly another. The technique is general, relatively 
simple, and noninvasive and might be applied for presymptomatic detection, 
although further validation with more subjects, preferably in multicenter 
studies, is recommended. It may also be applicable to study the other P300 peaks 
and their associated interpretations.

Increasing evidence suggests the utility of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as 
an important technique for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and for 
predicting the onset of this neurodegenerative disorder. In this study, we 
present a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model of great accuracy to 
diagnose the early stages of AD. A total of 373 MRI tests belonging to 150 
subjects (age ≥ 60) were examined and analyzed in parallel with fourteen 
distinct features related to standard AD diagnosis. Four ML models, such as 
naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural networks (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), 
and support-vector machines (SVM), and the receiver operating characteristic 
(ROC) curve metric were used to validate the model performance. Each model 
evaluation was done in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, a 
manual feature selection was used for model training, and ANN generated the 
highest accuracy in terms of ROC (0.812). In the second experiment, automatic 
feature selection was conducted by wrapping methods, and the NB achieved the 
highest ROC of 0.942. The last experiment consisted of an ensemble or hybrid 
modeling developed to combine the four models. This approach resulted in an 
improved accuracy ROC of 0.991. We conclude that the involvement of ensemble 
modeling, coupled with selective features, can predict with better accuracy the 
development of AD at an early stage.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents the intermediate stage between normal 
cerebral aging and dementia associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Early 
diagnosis of MCI and AD through artificial intelligence has captured 
considerable scholarly interest; researchers hope to develop therapies capable 
of slowing or halting these processes. We developed a state-of-the-art deep 
learning algorithm based on an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) 
topology called MCADNNet that simultaneously recognizes MCI, AD, and normally 
aging brains in adults over the age of 75 years, using structural and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data. Following highly detailed preprocessing, 
four-dimensional (4D) fMRI and 3D MRI were decomposed to create 2D images using 
a lossless transformation, which enables maximum preservation of data details. 
The samples were shuffled and subject-level training and testing datasets were 
completely independent. The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted 
invariant and hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by 
multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer. A decision-making 
algorithm was also designed to stabilize the outcome of the trained models. To 
measure the performance of classification, the accuracy rates for various 
pipelines were calculated before and after applying the decision-making 
algorithm. Accuracy rates of 99.77% 0.36% and 97.5% 1.16% were achieved for MRI 
and fMRI pipelines, respectively, after applying the decision-making algorithm. 
In conclusion, a cutting-edge and optimized topology called MCADNNet was 
designed and preceded a preprocessing pipeline; this was followed by a 
decision-making step that yielded the highest performance achieved for 
simultaneous classification of the three cohorts examined.

In several tauopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), an increased incidence 
of seizures is observed. Tau, one of the major proteins implicated in AD 
pathology, is an important regulator of neural network excitability and might 
participate in the underlying epileptic cascade. However, the mechanisms 
underlying this relationship are not fully elucidated. We aim to investigate 
this mechanism by analyzing seizure susceptibility to the convulsant 
pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in a novel rodent tauopathy model. A single dose of PTZ 
was systemically injected in Tau58/4 transgenic mice. To investigate whether 
young and aged heterozygous (HET) mice exhibit a higher susceptibility to 
seizures in comparison with wild-type (WT) littermates, video 
electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with behavioral scoring according to 
a modified Racine scale was used. The employment of different dosage groups 
enabled us to characterize the dose range reliably inducing seizures. Here, we 
report an increased seizure susceptibility in young but not in old HET Tau58/4 
mice. Young HET animals displayed more severe seizures and had a reduced latency 
to the first seizure compared to WTs. Also, age-related differences in 
susceptibility could be demonstrated for both genotypes. Identification and 
targeting of secondary diseases such as epilepsy, which aggravate dementia and 
lead to earlier institutionalization, is key. This study finds that tau 
pathology itself is sufficient to alter seizure susceptibility in a rodent 
model, indicating that the disease process is crucial in the emergence of 
epilepsy in patients with tauopathy.

This study used 11 C-PBR28 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to 
determine whether levels of 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), an 
inflammation-specific biomarker, are increased in frontotemporal lobar 
degeneration (FTLD) patients. 11 C-PBR28, 18 F-FDG, and 11 C-PIB brain PET 
scans, as well as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), were conducted in four FTLD 
patients and 22 healthy controls. 11 C-PBR28 scans revealed that all FTLD 
patients showed increased TSPO binding versus controls. Significantly greater 
increases in TSPO were observed in the frontal, lateral temporal, parietal, and 
occipital cortices, topographically consistent with individual clinical 
phenotypes and with brain MRI and 18 F-FDG PET. Amyloid burden was not 
increased.

We report on the ongoing project "PREDICT-ADFTD: Multimodal Imaging Prediction 
of AD/FTD and Differential Diagnosis" describing completed and future work 
supported by this grant. This project is a multi-site, multi-study collaboration 
effort with research spanning seven sites across the US and Canada. The overall 
goal of the project is to study neurodegeneration within Alzheimer's Disease, 
Frontotemporal Dementia, and related neurodegenerative disorders, using a 
variety of brain imaging and computational techniques to develop methods for the 
early and accurate prediction of disease and its course. The overarching goal of 
the project is to develop the earliest and most accurate biomarker that can 
differentiate clinical diagnoses to inform clinical trials and patient care. In 
its third year, this project has already completed several projects to achieve 
this goal, focusing on (1) structural MRI (2) machine learning and (3) FDG-PET 
and multimodal imaging. Studies utilizing structural MRI have identified key 
features of underlying pathology by studying hippocampal deformation that is 
unique to clinical diagnosis and also post-mortem confirmed neuropathology. 
Several machine learning experiments have shown high classification accuracy in 
the prediction of disease based on Convolutional Neural Networks utilizing MRI 
images as input. In addition, we have also achieved high accuracy in predicting 
conversion to DAT up to five years in the future. Further, we evaluated 
multimodal models that combine structural and FDG-PET imaging, in order to 
compare the predictive power of multimodal to unimodal models. Studies utilizing 
FDG-PET have shown significant predictive ability in the prediction and 
progression of disease.

OBJECTIVE: C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeats expansions account for almost half of 
familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
cases. Recent imaging studies in asymptomatic C9orf72 carriers have demonstrated 
cerebral white (WM) and gray matter (GM) degeneration before the age of 40 
years. The objective of this study was to characterize cervical spinal cord (SC) 
changes in asymptomatic C9orf72 hexanucleotide carriers.
METHODS: Seventy-two asymptomatic individuals were enrolled in a prospective 
study of first-degree relatives of ALS and FTD patients carrying the c9orf72 
hexanucleotide expansion. Forty of them carried the pathogenic mutation (C9+ ). 
Each subject underwent quantitative cervical cord imaging. Structural GM and WM 
metrics and diffusivity parameters were evaluated at baseline and 18 months 
later. Data were analyzed in C9+ and C9- subgroups, and C9+ subjects were 
further stratified by age.
RESULTS: At baseline, significant WM atrophy was detected at each cervical 
vertebral level in C9+ subjects older than 40 years without associated changes 
in GM and diffusion tensor imaging parameters. At 18-month follow-up, WM atrophy 
was accompanied by significant corticospinal tract (CST) fractional anisotropy 
(FA) reductions. Intriguingly, asymptomatic C9+ subjects older than 40 years 
with family history of ALS (as opposed to FTD) also exhibited significant CST FA 
reduction at baseline.
INTERPRETATION: Cervical SC imaging detects WM atrophy exclusively in C9+ 
subjects older than 40 years, and progressive CST FA reductions can be 
identified on 18-month follow-up. Cervical SC magnetic resonance imaging readily 
captures presymptomatic pathological changes and disease propagation in 
c9orf72-associated conditions. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:158-167.

In recent studies, neuroanatomical volume and shape asymmetries have been seen 
during the course of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and could potentially be used as 
preclinical imaging biomarkers for the prediction of Mild Cognitive Impairment 
(MCI) and AD dementia. In this study, a deep learning framework utilizing 
Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is 
used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. 
The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric 
features of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel 
trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and 
populations. By working with the low-dimensional features, Siamese networks were 
shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR 
images, with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time, while 
preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show 
that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding 
the asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods that 
do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.

White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are the most common brain-imaging feature of 
cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), hypertension being the main known risk 
factor. Here, we identify 27 genome-wide loci for WMH-volume in a cohort of 
50,970 older individuals, accounting for modification/confounding by 
hypertension. Aggregated WMH risk variants were associated with altered white 
matter integrity (p = 2.5×10-7) in brain images from 1,738 young healthy adults, 
providing insight into the lifetime impact of SVD genetic risk. Mendelian 
randomization suggested causal association of increasing WMH-volume with stroke, 
Alzheimer-type dementia, and of increasing blood pressure (BP) with larger 
WMH-volume, notably also in persons without clinical hypertension. 
Transcriptome-wide colocalization analyses showed association of WMH-volume with 
expression of 39 genes, of which four encode known drug targets. Finally, we 
provide insight into BP-independent biological pathways underlying SVD and 
suggest potential for genetic stratification of high-risk individuals and for 
genetically-informed prioritization of drug targets for prevention trials.

Imaging biomarkers can be used to screen participants for Alzheimer's disease 
clinical trials. To test the predictive values in clinical progression of 
neuropathology change (amyloid-PET) or brain metabolism as neurodegeneration 
biomarker ([18F]FDG-PET), we evaluated data from N = 268 healthy controls and 
N = 519 mild cognitive impairment subjects. Despite being a significant risk 
factor, amyloid positivity was not associated with clinical progression in the 
majority (≥60%) of subjects. Notably, a negative [18F]FDG-PET scan at baseline 
strongly predicted clinical stability with high negative predictive values 
(>0.80) for both groups. We suggest [18F]FDG-PET brain metabolism or other 
neurodegeneration measures should be coupled to amyloid-PET to exclude 
clinically stable individuals from clinical trials.

[18F]AV-1451 is one of the most widely used radiotracers for positron emission 
tomography (PET) imaging of tau protein aggregates in neurodegenerative 
disorders. While the radiotracer binds with high affinity to tau neurofibrillary 
tangles, extensive clinical studies have simultaneously revealed off-target 
tracer accumulation in areas of low tau burden such as the basal ganglia and 
choroid plexus. Though there are a number of possible reasons for this 
accumulation, it is often attributed to off-target binding to monoamine oxidase 
(MAO). In this paper, we investigate the association between [18F]AV-1451 and 
MAO through (i) enzyme inhibition assays, (ii) autoradiography with postmortem 
tissue samples, and (iii) nonhuman primate PET imaging. We confirm that 
[18F]AV-1451 is a weak inhibitor of MAO-A and -B and that MAO inhibitors can 
alter binding of [18F]AV-1451 in autoradiography and in vivo PET imaging.

BACKGROUND: Electron transport chain is a series of protein complexes embedded 
in the process of cellular respiration, which is an important process to 
transfer electrons and other macromolecules throughout the cell. It is also the 
major process to extract energy via redox reactions in the case of oxidation of 
sugars. Many studies have determined that the electron transport protein has 
been implicated in a variety of human diseases, i.e. diabetes, Parkinson, 
Alzheimer's disease and so on. Few bioinformatics studies have been conducted to 
identify the electron transport proteins with high accuracy, however, their 
performance results require a lot of improvements. Here, we present a novel deep 
neural network architecture to address this problem.
RESULTS: Most of the previous studies could not use the original position 
specific scoring matrix (PSSM) profiles to feed into neural networks, leading to 
a lack of information and the neural networks consequently could not achieve the 
best results. In this paper, we present a novel approach by using deep gated 
recurrent units (GRU) on full PSSMs to resolve this problem. Our approach can 
precisely predict the electron transporters with the cross-validation and 
independent test accuracy of 93.5 and 92.3%, respectively. Our approach 
demonstrates superior performance to all of the state-of-the-art predictors on 
electron transport proteins.
CONCLUSIONS: Through the proposed study, we provide ET-GRU, a web server for 
discriminating electron transport proteins in particular and other protein 
functions in general. Also, our achievement could promote the use of GRU in 
computational biology, especially in protein function prediction.

Background and Objective: Ventricle volume is closely related to hydrocephalus, 
brain atrophy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's syndrome, and other diseases. To 
accurately measure the volume of the ventricles for elderly patients, we use 
deep learning to establish a systematic and comprehensive automated ventricle 
segmentation framework. Methods: The study participation included 20 normal 
elderly people, 20 patients with cerebral atrophy, 64 patients with normal 
pressure hydrocephalus, and 51 patients with acquired hydrocephalus. Second, get 
their imaging data through the picture archiving and communication systems 
(PACS) system. Then use ITK software to manually label participants' ventricular 
structures. Finally, extract imaging features through machine learning. Results: 
This automated ventricle segmentation method can be applied not only to CT and 
MRI images but also to images with different scan slice thicknesses. More 
importantly, it produces excellent segmentation results (Dice > 0.9). 
Conclusion: This automated ventricle segmentation method has wide applicability 
and clinical practicability. It can help clinicians find early disease, diagnose 
disease, understand the patient's disease progression, and evaluate the 
patient's treatment effect.

OBJECTIVE: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is caused by cerebrovascular 
deposition of β-amyloid fragments leading to cerebrovascular dysfunction and 
other brain injuries. This phase 2, randomized, double-blind trial in patients 
with probable CAA assessed the efficacy and safety of ponezumab, a novel 
monoclonal antibody against Aβ 1-40.
METHODS: Thirty-six participants aged 55-80 years with probable CAA received 
intravenous placebo (n = 12) or ponezumab (n = 24). The change from baseline to 
Days 2 and 90 in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was measured in the visual 
cortex as the natural log of the rising slope of the BOLD fMRI response to a 
visual stimulus. Safety and tolerability were also assessed.
RESULTS: The mean change from baseline to Day 90 was 0.817 (ponezumab) and 0.958 
(placebo): a mean ratio of 0.852 (90% CI 0.735-0.989) representing a trend 
towards reduced CVR in the ponezumab group. This trend was not present at Day 2. 
There was one asymptomatic occurrence of amyloid-related imaging 
abnormality-edema in the ponezumab group. The total number of new cerebral 
microbleeds from baseline to day 90 did not differ between groups. The ponezumab 
group had a participant with nonfatal new cerebral hemorrhage with aphasia and a 
participant with subdural hemorrhage that site investigators deemed to be 
nondrug related. In the placebo group one participant had a fatal intracerebral 
hemorrhage and one participant had migraine with aura.
INTERPRETATION: Ponezumab was safe and well-tolerated. The ponezumab group 
showed a trend towards treatment effect at Day 90 that was opposite to the 
hypothesized direction. The prespecified efficacy criteria were thus not met.

In recent days, deep learning technologies have achieved tremendous success in 
computer vision-related tasks with the help of large-scale annotated dataset. 
Obtaining such dataset for medical image analysis is very challenging. Working 
with the limited dataset and small amount of annotated samples makes it 
difficult to develop a robust automated disease diagnosis model. We propose a 
novel approach to generate synthetic medical images using generative adversarial 
networks (GANs). Our proposed model can create brain PET images for three 
different stages of Alzheimer's disease-normal control (NC), mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD).

BACKGROUND: Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common cause of 
early-onset neurodegenerative dementia. Several studies have focused on early 
imaging changes in FTD patients, but once subjects meet full criteria for FTD 
diagnosis, structural changes are generally widespread.
OBJECTIVE: This study aims to determine the earliest structural brain changes in 
asymptomatic MAPT MUTATION carriers.
METHODS: This is a cross-sectional multicenter study comparing global and 
regional brain volume and white matter integrity in a group of MAPT mutation 
preclinical carriers and controls. Participants belong to multiple generations 
of six families with five MAPT mutations. All participants underwent a medical 
examination, neuropsychological tests, genetic analysis, and a magnetic 
resonance scan (3T, scout, T1-weighted image followed by EPI (BOLD), MPRAGE, 
DTI, FLAIR, and ASL sequences).
RESULTS: Volumes of five cortical and subcortical areas were strongly correlated 
with mutation status: temporal lobe (left amygdala, left temporal pole), 
cingulate cortex (left rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, right posterior 
cingulate), and the lingual gyrus in the occipital lobe. We did not find 
significant differences in whole brain volume, white matter hyperintensities 
volume, and white matter integrity using DTI analysis.
CONCLUSION: Temporal lobe, cingulate cortex and the lingual gyrus seem to be 
early targets of the disease and may serve as biomarkers for FTD prior to overt 
symptom onset.

PURPOSE: Although functional brain imaging has been used for the early and 
objective assessment of cognitive dysfunction, there is a lack of generalized 
image-based biomarker which can evaluate individual's cognitive dysfunction in 
various disorders. To this end, we developed a deep learning-based cognitive 
signature of FDG brain PET adaptable for Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as 
Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: A deep learning model for discriminating AD from normal controls (NCs) 
was built by a training set consisting of 636 FDG PET obtained from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The model was directly transferred to 
images of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (n = 666) for identifying who 
would rapidly convert to AD and another independent cohort consisting of 62 PD 
patients to differentiate PD patients with dementia. The model accuracy was 
measured by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
analysis. The relationship between all images was visualized by two-dimensional 
projection of the deep learning-based features. The model was also designed to 
predict cognitive score of the subjects and validated in PD patients. Cognitive 
dysfunction-related regions were visualized by feature maps of the deep CNN 
model.
RESULTS: AUC of ROC for differentiating AD from NC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.98). 
The transfer of the model could differentiate MCI patients who would convert to 
AD (AUC = 0.82) and PD with dementia (AUC = 0.81). The two-dimensional 
projection mapping visualized the degree of cognitive dysfunction compared with 
normal brains regardless of different disease cohorts. Predicted cognitive 
score, an output of the model, was highly correlated with the mini-mental status 
exam scores. Individual cognitive dysfunction-related regions included cingulate 
and high frontoparietal cortices, while they showed individual variability.
CONCLUSION: The deep learning-based cognitive function evaluation model could be 
successfully transferred to multiple disease domains. We suggest that this 
approach might be extended to an objective cognitive signature that provides 
quantitative biomarker for cognitive dysfunction across various 
neurodegenerative disorders.

OBJECTIVE: Newer magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques have shown promise 
in capturing early Parkinson disease (PD)-related changes in the substantia 
nigra pars compacta (SNc), the key pathological loci. Their translational value, 
however, is hindered by technical complexity and inconsistent results.
METHODS: A novel yet simple MRI contrast, the T1w/T2w ratio, was used to study 
76 PD patients and 70 controls. The T1w/T2w ratio maps were analyzed using both 
voxel-based and region-of-interest approaches in normalized space. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the SNc T1w/T2w ratio in discriminating between 
PD and controls also were assessed. In addition, its diagnostic performance was 
tested in a subgroup of PD patients with disease duration ≤2 years (PDE). A 
second independent cohort of 73 PD patients and 49 controls was used for 
validation.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, PD patients showed a higher T1w/T2w ratio in both 
the right (cluster size = 164mm3 , p < 0.0001) and left (cluster size = 213mm3 , 
p < 0.0001) midbrain that was located ventrolateral to the red nucleus and 
corresponded to the SNc. The region-of-interest approach confirmed the group 
difference in the SNc T1w/T2w ratio between PD and controls (p < 0.0001). The 
SNc T1w/T2w ratio had high sensitivity (0.908) and specificity (0.80) to 
separate PD and controls (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.926), even for PDE 
patients (AUC = 0.901, sensitivity = 0.857, specificity = 0.857). These results 
were validated in the second cohort.
INTERPRETATION: The T1w/T2w ratio can detect PD-related changes in the SNc and 
may be used as a novel, parsimonious in vivo biomarker for the disease, 
particularly for early stage patients, with high translational value for 
clinical practice and research. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:96-104.

Alzheimer's disease is an incurable, progressive neurological brain disorder. 
Earlier detection of Alzheimer's disease can help with proper treatment and 
prevent brain tissue damage. Several statistical and machine learning models 
have been exploited by researchers for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. Analyzing 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a common practice for Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis in clinical research. Detection of Alzheimer's disease is exacting due 
to the similarity in Alzheimer's disease MRI data and standard healthy MRI data 
of older people. Recently, advanced deep learning techniques have successfully 
demonstrated human-level performance in numerous fields including medical image 
analysis. We propose a deep convolutional neural network for Alzheimer's disease 
diagnosis using brain MRI data analysis. While most of the existing approaches 
perform binary classification, our model can identify different stages of 
Alzheimer's disease and obtains superior performance for early-stage diagnosis. 
We conducted ample experiments to demonstrate that our proposed model 
outperformed comparative baselines on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies 
dataset.

Performing an accurate segmentation of the hippocampus from brain magnetic 
resonance images is a crucial task in neuroimaging research, since its 
structural integrity is strongly related to several neurodegenerative disorders, 
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some automatic segmentation tools are 
already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL)-based methods 
have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation 
tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework 
that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the 
deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with 
three main steps: (1) a U-Net-based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation, 
and (3) a second U-Net-based segmentation which uses both the original input 
data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on 
image data of three diagnostic groups [AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) and controls] from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both 
intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared 
with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of 
context information (i.e., autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results 
suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in 
cross-cohort validation, i.e., when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied 
to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort 
validation, i.e., training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. 
Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape 
context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while 
keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to changes in fMRI task activations and fMRI 
resting-state functional connectivity (restFC), which can emerge early in the 
illness timecourse. These fMRI correlates of unhealthy aging have been studied 
in largely separate subfields. Taking inspiration from neural network 
simulations, we propose a unifying mechanism wherein restFC alterations 
associated with AD disrupt the flow of activations between brain regions, 
leading to aberrant task activations. We apply this activity flow model in a 
large sample of clinically normal older adults, which was segregated into 
healthy (low-risk) and at-risk subgroups based on established imaging (positron 
emission tomography amyloid) and genetic (apolipoprotein) AD risk factors. 
Modeling the flow of healthy activations over at-risk AD connectivity 
effectively transformed the healthy aged activations into unhealthy (at-risk) 
aged activations. This enabled reliable prediction of at-risk AD task 
activations, and these predicted activations were related to individual 
differences in task behavior. These results support activity flow over altered 
intrinsic functional connections as a mechanism underlying Alzheimer's-related 
dysfunction, even in very early stages of the illness. Beyond these mechanistic 
insights, this approach raises clinical potential by enabling prediction of task 
activations and associated cognitive dysfunction in individuals without 
requiring them to perform in-scanner cognitive tasks.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain degenerative disorder 
affecting people aged older than 65 years. Currently, there is no effective cure 
for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some treatments. Accurate and 
early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future 
treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a 
functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be powerful to help 
understand the anatomical and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most 
existing methods extract the handcrafted features from images, and then design a 
classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. These methods highly depends on 
the preprocessing of brain images, including image rigid registration and 
segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, 
this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D 
convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which 
learns the intra-slice and inter-slice features for classification after 
decomposition of the 3D PET image into a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are 
built to capture the features of image slices while the gated recurrent unit 
(GRU) of RNN is cascaded to learn and integrate the inter-slice features for 
image classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for 
PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline FDG-PET images acquired from 
339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 
100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an area 
under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.3% for AD vs. NC 
classification and 83.9% for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the 
promising classification performance.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) based on the 
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal has been widely used in healthy 
individuals and patients to investigate brain functions when the subjects are in 
a resting or task-negative state. Head motion considerably confounds the 
interpretation of rs-fMRI data. Nuisance regression is commonly used to reduce 
motion-related artifacts with six motion parameters estimated from rigid-body 
realignment as regressors. To further compensate for the effect of head 
movement, the first-order temporal derivatives of motion parameters and squared 
motion parameters were proposed previously as possible motion regressors. 
However, these additional regressors may not be sufficient to model the impact 
of head motion because of the complexity of motion artifacts. In addition, while 
using more motion-related regressors could explain more variance in the data, 
the neural signal may also be removed with increasing number of motion 
regressors. To better model how in-scanner motion affects rs-fMRI data, a robust 
and automated convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed in this 
study to obtain optimal motion regressors. The CNN network consists of two 
temporal convolutional layers and the output from the network are the derived 
motion regressors used in the following nuisance regression. The temporal 
convolutional layer in the network can non-parametrically model the prolonged 
effect of head motion. The set of regressors derived from the neural network is 
compared with the same number of regressors used in a traditional nuisance 
regression approach. It is demonstrated that the CNN-derived regressors can more 
effectively reduce motion-related artifacts.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a focus of 
considerable research. The present study aimed to test the utility of a logistic 
regression-derived classifier, combining specific quantitative multimodal 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for the early objective phenotyping of MCI 
in the clinic, over structural MRI data.
METHODS: Thirty-three participants with cognitively stable amnestic MCI; 15 MCI 
converters to early Alzheimer's disease (AD; diseased controls) and 20 healthy 
controls underwent high-resolution T1-weighted volumetric MRI, diffusion tensor 
imaging (DTI), and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MR spectroscopy). 
The regional volumes were obtained from T1-weighted MRI. The fractional 
anisotropy and mean diffusivity maps were derived from DTI over multiple white 
matter regions. The 1H MRS voxels were placed over posterior cingulate gyri, and 
N-acetyl aspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), choline (Cho)/Cr, myoinositol (mI/Cr), 
and NAA/mI ratios were obtained. A multimodal classifier comprising MR 
volumetry, DTI, and MRS was prepared. A cutoff point was arrived based on 
receiver operator characteristics analysis. Results were considered significant, 
if P < 0.05.
RESULTS: The most sensitive individual marker to discriminate MCI from controls 
was DTI (90.9%), with a specificity of 50%. For classifying MCI from AD, the 
best individual modality was DTI (72.7%), with a high specificity of 87.9%. The 
multimodal classifier approach for MCI control classification achieved an area 
under curve (AUC) (AUC = 0.89; P < 0.001), with 93.9% sensitivity and 70% 
specificity. The combined classifier for MCI-AD achieved a highest AUC (AUC = 
0.93; P < 0.001), with 93% sensitivity and 85.6% specificity.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined method of gray matter atrophy, white matter tract 
changes, and metabolite variation achieved a better performance at classifying 
MCI compared to the application of individual MRI biomarkers.

Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human 
brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical 
smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) applications. 
From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, 
multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In 
this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed 
to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain 
states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate 
Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to 
effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected 
into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform 
(CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted 
from δ, θ, α1, α2, β EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear 
phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are 
extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set 
of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG 
sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to 
perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. 
HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that 
includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when 
the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multi-modal (CWT+BiS) 
features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier 
outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic 
Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed 
multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art 
computationally intensive deep learning approaches.

OBJECTIVE: To measure postmortem burden of frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
(FTLD) with TDP-43 (FTLD-TDP) or tau (FTLD-Tau) proteinopathy across hemispheres 
in primary progressive aphasia (PPA) using digital histopathology and to 
identify clinicopathological correlates of these distinct proteinopathies.
METHODS: In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD-TDP = 13, FTLD-Tau = 14), we analyzed 
laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a 
validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up 
to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem 
structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features.
RESULTS: Postmortem cortical pathology was left-lateralized in both FTLD-TDP 
(beta = -0.15, standard error [SE] = 0.05, p = 0.007) and FTLD-Tau 
(beta = -0.09, SE = 0.04, p = 0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased 
with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta = -8.18, SE = 3.22, p 
= 0.015). Among 5 core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in 
left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD-TDP, which was greater than in FTLD-Tau 
(F = 47.07, df = 1,17, p < 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in 
FTLD-Tau, which was greater than in FTLD-TDP (F = 19.34, df = 1,16, p < 0.001). 
Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic resonance 
imaging cortical thickness (beta = -0.04, SE = 0.01, p = 0.007) in regions 
matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single-word 
comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t 
= -3.72, df = 10.72, p = 0.004) and nonfluent speech with greater left MFC 
pathology (t = -3.62, df = 12.00, p = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions.
INTERPRETATION: In PPA, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau have divergent anatomic 
distributions of left-lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem 
structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain regions 
may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, 
our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of 
neuropathology in PPA. Ann Neurol 2019;85:630-643.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the associations of Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) uptake 
in white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and normal appearing white matter (NAWM) 
with white matter (WM) integrity measured with DTI and cognitive function in 
cognitively unimpaired older adults.
METHODS: Cognitively unimpaired older adults from the population-based Mayo 
Clinic Study of Aging (n = 537, age 65-95) who underwent both PiB PET and DTI 
were included. The associations of WM PiB standard uptake value ratio (SUVr) 
with fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) in the WMH and NAWM 
were tested after adjusting for age. The associations of PiB SUVr with cognitive 
function z-scores were tested after adjusting for age and global cortical PiB 
SUVr.
RESULTS: The WMH PiB SUVr was lower than NAWM PiB SUVr (P < 0.001). In the WMH, 
lower PiB SUVr correlated with lower FA (r = 0.21, P < 0.001), and higher MD 
(r = -0.31, P < 0.001). In the NAWM, lower PiB SUVr only correlated with higher 
MD (r = -0.10, P = 0.02). Both in the WMH and NAWM, lower PiB SUVr was 
associated with lower memory, language, and global cognitive function z-scores 
after adjusting for age and global cortical PiB SUVr.
INTERPRETATION: Reduced PiB uptake in the WMH is associated with a loss of WM 
integrity and cognitive function after accounting for the global cortical PiB 
uptake, suggesting that WM PiB uptake may be an early biomarker of WM integrity 
that precedes cognitive impairment in older adults. When using WM as a reference 
region in cross-sectional analysis of PiB SUVr, individual variability in WMH 
volume as well as age should be considered.

The prediction of the conversion of healthy individuals and those with mild 
cognitive impairment to the status of active Alzheimer's disease is a 
challenging task. Recently, a survival analysis based upon deep learning was 
developed to enable predictions regarding the timing of an event in a dataset 
containing censored data. Here, we investigated whether a deep survival analysis 
could similarly predict the conversion to Alzheimer's disease. We selected 
individuals with mild cognitive impairment and cognitively normal subjects and 
used the grey matter volumes of brain regions in these subjects as predictive 
features. We then compared the prediction performances of the traditional 
standard Cox proportional-hazard model, the DeepHit model and our deep survival 
model based on a Weibull distribution. Our model achieved a maximum concordance 
index of 0.835, which was higher than that yielded by the Cox model and 
comparable to that of the DeepHit model. To our best knowledge, this is the 
first report to describe the application of a deep survival model to brain 
magnetic resonance imaging data. Our results demonstrate that this type of 
analysis could successfully predict the time of an individual's conversion to 
Alzheimer's disease.

Chronic cerebral hypoperfusion (CCH) is associated with cognitive decline in 
aging, Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia. Neural oscillations and their 
interactions support brain communication and involve in cognitive function. 
Although arginine vasopressin (AVP) has been linked to spatial learning and 
memory, the effects of AVP on CCH in terms of the hippocampal neural network is 
unknown. Here we investigated the dynamics of neural oscillations in the 
hippocampus in a rat model of permanent bilateral carotid arteries occlusion 
(two-vessel occlusion, 2VO) under urethane-anesthesia. Hypertonic saline (5.3%) 
was injected intraperitoneally to induce the endogenous AVP, and SR49059 was 
used as V1a receptor (an AVP receptor) antagonist. The results showed that AVP 
partly changed CA3 Schaffer collateral (CA3-SC) power distribution in the rat 
model of 2VO via V1a receptor, increased theta synchrony between CA3-SC and CA1 
areas, enhanced CA3-SC theta-middle gamma phase-phase coupling, and improved 
spatial learning and memory performance. Biochemical fractionation further 
confirmed the recovery effect on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor subunit 2B (NR2B) 
and postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD-95) surface expressions after 
hypertonic saline injection, suggesting a possible molecular mechanism in the 
hippocampus. The findings shed light on a functional role of endogenous AVP from 
a neural network perspective that AVP improves theta synchronization and 
accurate coordination of theta-gamma coupling probably through upregulating NR2B 
and PSD-95 expressions, and further promotes neural communication in the 
hippocampus to some extent. As a result, the impairment of spatial learning and 
memory induced by CCH is significantly alleviated.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease causing 
dementia and poses significant health risks to middle-aged and elderly people. 
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used diagnostic method 
for AD. However, it is challenging to collect sufficient brain imaging data with 
high-quality annotations. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) is a machine learning 
technique aimed at learning effective feature representation from limited or 
low-quality annotations. In this paper, we propose a WSL-based deep learning 
(DL) framework (ADGNET) consisting of a backbone network with an attention 
mechanism and a task network for simultaneous image classification and image 
reconstruction to identify and classify AD using limited annotations. The ADGNET 
achieves excellent performance based on six evaluation metrics (Kappa, 
sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-score) on two brain MRI 
datasets (2D MRI and 3D MRI data) using fine-tuning with only 20% of the labels 
from both datasets. The ADGNET has an F1-score of 99.61% and sensitivity is 
99.69%, outperforming two state-of-the-art models (ResNext WSL and SimCLR). The 
proposed method represents a potential WSL-based computer-aided diagnosis method 
for AD in clinical practice.

An early intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly essential due to the 
fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major life-threatening 
issues, especially memory loss among patients in society. Moreover, categorizing 
NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course 
allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is 
important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the 
patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we 
developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) 
classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI 
modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed 
framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI 
regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from 
the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. 
Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through 
Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN 
classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the 
training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This 
newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of 
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is 
carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our 
proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 
96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The 
experimental results suggest that the removal of noisy samples from the training 
data can enhance the decision generation process of the expert systems.

As the number of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases, the effort 
needed to care for these patients increases as well. At the same time, advances 
in information and sensor technologies have reduced caring costs, providing a 
potential pathway for developing healthcare services for AD patients. For 
instance, if a virtual reality (VR) system can provide emotion-adaptive content, 
the time that AD patients spend interacting with VR content is expected to be 
extended, allowing caregivers to focus on other tasks. As the first step towards 
this goal, in this study, we develop a classification model that detects AD 
patients' emotions (e.g., happy, peaceful, or bored). We first collected 
electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 Korean female AD patients who watched 
emotion-evoking videos at a medical rehabilitation center. We applied 
conventional machine learning algorithms, such as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) 
and support vector machine, along with deep learning models of recurrent neural 
network (RNN) architectures. The best performance was obtained from MLP, which 
achieved an average accuracy of 70.97%; the RNN model's accuracy reached only 
48.18%. Our study results open a new stream of research in the field of 
EEG-based emotion detection for patients with neurological disorders.

Brain Arrhythmias Induced by Amyloid Beta and Inflammation: Involvement in 
Alzheimer's Disease and Other Inflammation-related Pathologies.

A variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), involve 
amyloid beta (Aβ) accumulation and/or neuroinflammation, which can alter 
synaptic and neural circuit functions. Consequently, these pathological 
conditions induce changes in neural network rhythmic activity (brain 
arrhythmias), which affects many brain functions. Neural network rhythms are 
involved in information processing, storage and retrieval, which are essential 
for memory consolidation, executive functioning and sensory processing. 
Therefore, brain arrhythmias could have catastrophic effects on circuit 
function, underlying the symptoms of various neurological diseases. Moreover, 
brain arrhythmias can serve as biomarkers for a variety of brain diseases. The 
aim of this review is to provide evidence linking Aβ and inflammation to neural 
network dysfunction, focusing on alterations in brain rhythms and their impact 
on cognition and sensory processing. I reviewed the most common brain 
arrhythmias characterized in AD, in AD transgenic models and those induced by 
Aβ. In addition, I reviewed the modulations of brain rhythms in 
neuroinflammatory diseases and those induced by immunogens, interleukins and 
microglia. This review reveals that Aβ and inflammation produce a complex set of 
effects on neural network function, which are related to the induction of brain 
arrhythmias and hyperexcitability, both closely related to behavioral 
alterations. Understanding these brain arrhythmias can help to develop 
therapeutic strategies to halt or prevent these neural network alterations and 
treat not only the arrhythmias but also the symptoms of AD and other 
inflammation-related pathologies.

OBJECTIVE: To identify common genetic variants associated with the presence of 
brain microbleeds (BMBs).
METHODS: We performed genome-wide association studies in 11 population-based 
cohort studies and 3 case-control or case-only stroke cohorts. Genotypes were 
imputed to the Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1000 Genomes reference panel. 
BMBs were rated on susceptibility-weighted or T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI 
sequences, and further classified as lobar or mixed (including strictly deep and 
infratentorial, possibly with lobar BMB). In a subset, we assessed the effects 
of APOE ε2 and ε4 alleles on BMB counts. We also related previously identified 
cerebral small vessel disease variants to BMBs.
RESULTS: BMBs were detected in 3,556 of the 25,862 participants, of which 2,179 
were strictly lobar and 1,293 mixed. One locus in the APOE region reached 
genome-wide significance for its association with BMB (lead single nucleotide 
polymorphism rs769449; odds ratio [OR]any BMB [95% confidence interval (CI)] 
1.33 [1.21-1.45]; p = 2.5 × 10-10). APOE ε4 alleles were associated with 
strictly lobar (OR [95% CI] 1.34 [1.19-1.50]; p = 1.0 × 10-6) but not with mixed 
BMB counts (OR [95% CI] 1.04 [0.86-1.25]; p = 0.68). APOE ε2 alleles did not 
show associations with BMB counts. Variants previously related to deep 
intracerebral hemorrhage and lacunar stroke, and a risk score of cerebral white 
matter hyperintensity variants, were associated with BMB.
CONCLUSIONS: Genetic variants in the APOE region are associated with the 
presence of BMB, most likely due to the APOE ε4 allele count related to a higher 
number of strictly lobar BMBs. Genetic predisposition to small vessel disease 
confers risk of BMB, indicating genetic overlap with other cerebral small vessel 
disease markers.

Neuroimaging, in particular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), has been playing 
an important role in understanding brain functionalities and its disorders 
during the last couple of decades. These cutting-edge MRI scans, supported by 
high-performance computational tools and novel ML techniques, have opened up 
possibilities to unprecedentedly identify neurological disorders. However, 
similarities in disease phenotypes make it very difficult to detect such 
disorders accurately from the acquired neuroimaging data. This article 
critically examines and compares performances of the existing deep learning 
(DL)-based methods to detect neurological disorders-focusing on Alzheimer's 
disease, Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia-from MRI data acquired using 
different modalities including functional and structural MRI. The comparative 
performance analysis of various DL architectures across different disorders and 
imaging modalities suggests that the Convolutional Neural Network outperforms 
other methods in detecting neurological disorders. Towards the end, a number of 
current research challenges are indicated and some possible future research 
directions are provided.

BACKGROUND: Compared with single-modal neuroimages classification of AD, 
multi-modal classification can achieve better performance by fusing different 
information. Exploring synergy among various multi-modal neuroimages is 
contributed to identifying the pathological process of neurological disorders. 
However, it is still problematic to effectively exploit multi-modal information 
since the lack of an effective fusion method.
NEW METHOD: In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal fusion network based on 
the attention mechanism, which can selectively extract features from MRI and PET 
branches and suppress irrelevant information. In the attention model, the fusion 
ratio of each modality is assigned automatically according to the importance of 
the data. A hierarchical fusion method is adopted to ensure the effectiveness of 
Multi-modal Fusion.
RESULTS: Evaluating the model on the ADNI dataset, the experimental results show 
that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the final 
classification results of the NC/AD, SMCI/PMCI and Four-Class are 95.21 %, 89.79 
%, and 86.15 %, respectively.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: Different from the early fusion and the late 
fusion, the hierarchical fusion method contributes to learning the synergy 
between the multi-modal data. Compared with some other prominent algorithms, the 
attention model enables our network to focus on the regions of interest and 
effectively fuse the multi-modal data.
CONCLUSION: Benefit from the hierarchical structure with attention model, the 
proposed network is capable of exploiting low-level and high-level features 
extracted from the multi-modal data and improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis. 
Results show its promising performance.

OBJECTIVE: This retrospective and exploratory study tested the accuracy of 
artificial neural networks (ANNs) at detecting Alzheimer's disease patients with 
dementia (ADD) based on input variables extracted from resting-state 
electroencephalogram (rsEEG), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) or 
both.
METHODS: For the classification exercise, the ANNs had two architectures that 
included stacked (autoencoding) hidden layers recreating input data in the 
output. The classification was based on LORETA source estimates from rsEEG 
activity recorded with 10-20 montage system (19 electrodes) and standard sMRI 
variables in 89 ADD and 45 healthy control participants taken from a national 
database.
RESULTS: The ANN with stacked autoencoders and a deep leaning model representing 
both ADD and control participants showed classification accuracies in 
discriminating them of 80%, 85%, and 89% using rsEEG, sMRI, and rsEEG + sMRI 
features, respectively. The two ANNs with stacked autoencoders and a deep 
leaning model specialized for either ADD or control participants showed 
classification accuracies of 77%, 83%, and 86% using the same input features.
CONCLUSIONS: The two architectures of ANNs using stacked (autoencoding) hidden 
layers consistently reached moderate to high accuracy in the discrimination 
between ADD and healthy control participants as a function of the rsEEG and sMRI 
features employed.
SIGNIFICANCE: The present results encourage future multi-centric, prospective 
and longitudinal cross-validation studies using high resolution EEG techniques 
and harmonized clinical procedures towards clinical applications of the present 
ANNs.

In this article, the authors aim to maximally utilize multimodality neuroimaging 
and genetic data for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal 
status, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), from normal aging subjects. 
Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights 
into brain abnormalities, while genetic data such as single nucleotide 
polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient's AD risk factors. When 
these data are used together, the accuracy of AD diagnosis may be improved. 
However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., with different data distributions), 
and have different number of samples (e.g., with far less number of PET samples 
than the number of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these 
data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature 
learning and fusion framework, where deep neural network is trained stage-wise. 
Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different 
combinations of modalities, via effective training using the maximum number of 
available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent 
representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so 
that the heterogeneity among modalities can be partially addressed, and 
high-level features from different modalities can be combined in the next stage. 
In the second stage, we learn joint latent features for each pair of modality 
combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In 
the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint 
latent features from the second stage. To further increase the number of samples 
during training, we also use data at multiple scanning time points for each 
training subject in the dataset. We evaluate the proposed framework using 
Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis, and 
the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other 
state-of-the-art methods.

BACKGROUND: EEG signals obtained from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and the 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients are visually indistinguishable.
NEW METHOD: A new methodology is presented for differential diagnosis of MCI and 
the AD through adroit integration of a new signal processing technique, the 
integrated multiple signal classification and empirical wavelet transform 
(MUSIC-EWT), different nonlinear features such as fractality dimension (FD) from 
the chaos theory, and a classification algorithm, the enhanced probabilistic 
neural network model of Ahmadlou and Adeli using the EEG signals.
RESULTS: Three different FD measures are investigated: Box dimension (BD), 
Higuchi's FD (HFD), and Katz's FD (KFD) along with another measure of the 
self-similarities of the signals known as the Hurst exponent (HE). The accuracy 
of the proposed method was verified using the monitored EEG signals from 37 MCI 
and 37 AD patients.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS: The proposed method is compared with other 
methodologies presented in the literature recently.
CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that the proposed method, MUSIC-EWT algorithm 
combined with nonlinear features BD and HE, and the EPNN classifier can be 
employed for differential diagnosis of MCI and AD patients with an accuracy of 
90.3%.

Early detection is critical for effective management of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
and screening for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is common practice. Among 
several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural 
brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network 
(CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature 
learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, 
ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of 
learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a 
classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL 
approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification 
between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will 
convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert 
to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were 
trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN 
models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble 
was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. 
The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable 
slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the 
sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard 
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the 
ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, 
the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly 
contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate 
of 0.84 ± 0.05, 0.79 ± 0.04, and 0.62 ± 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD 
vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D 
deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular 
Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. 
Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and 
several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be 
struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple 
patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. 
These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL 
approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the 
trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model 
was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the 
disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex 
heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to 
examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated 
CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject's disease 
status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated 
CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection 
of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, 
in a data-driven way.

INTRODUCTION: The earliest changes in the brain due to Alzheimer's disease are 
associated with the neural networks related to memory function. We investigated 
changes in functional and structural connectivity among regions that support 
memory function in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, i.e., during the mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) stage.
METHODS: Twenty-three older healthy controls and 25 adults with MCI underwent 
multimodal MRI scanning. Limbic white matter tracts-the fornix, parahippocampal 
cingulum, retrosplenial cingulum, subgenual cingulum and uncinate 
fasciculus-were reconstructed in ExploreDTI using constrained spherical 
deconvolution-based tractography. Using a network-of-interest approach, 
resting-state functional connectivity time-series correlations among 
sub-parcellations of the default mode and limbic networks, the hippocampus and 
the thalamus were calculated in Conn.
ANALYSIS: Controlling for age, education, and gender between group linear 
regressions of five diffusion-weighted measures and of resting state 
connectivity measures were performed per hemisphere. FDR-corrections were 
performed within each class of measures. Correlations of within-network Fisher 
Z-transformed correlation coefficients and the mean diffusivity per tract were 
performed. Whole-brain graph theory measures of cluster coefficient and average 
path length were inspecting using the resting state data.
RESULTS & CONCLUSION: MCI-related changes in white matter structure were found 
in the fornix, left parahippocampal cingulum, left retrosplenial cingulum and 
left subgenual cingulum. Functional connectivity decreases were observed in the 
MCI group within the DMN-a sub-network, between the hippocampus and sub-areas -a 
and -c of the DMN, between DMN-c and DMN-a, and, in the right hemisphere only 
between DMN-c and both the thalamus and limbic-a. No relationships between white 
matter tract 'integrity' (mean diffusivity) and within sub-network functional 
connectivity were found. Graph theory revealed that changes in the MCI group was 
mostly restricted to diminished between-neighbour connections of the hippocampi 
and of nodes within DMN-a and DMN-b.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease, with 10% 
prevalence in the elder population. Conventional Machine Learning (ML) was 
proven effective in supporting the diagnosis of AD, while very few studies 
investigated the performance of deep learning and transfer learning in this 
complex task. In this paper, we evaluated the potential of ensemble 
transfer-learning techniques, pretrained on generic images and then transferred 
to structural brain MRI, for the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD, with 
respect to a fusion of conventional-ML approaches based on Support Vector 
Machine directly applied to structural brain MRI. Specifically, more than 600 
subjects were obtained from the ADNI repository, including AD, Mild Cognitive 
Impaired converting to AD (MCIc), Mild Cognitive Impaired not converting to AD 
(MCInc), and cognitively-normal (CN) subjects. We used T1-weighted cerebral-MRI 
studies to train: (1) an ensemble of five transfer-learning architectures 
pretrained on generic images; (2) a 3D Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) 
trained from scratch on MRI volumes; and (3) a fusion of two conventional-ML 
classifiers derived from different feature extraction/selection techniques 
coupled to SVM. The AD-vs-CN, MCIc-vs-CN, MCIc-vs-MCInc comparisons were 
investigated. The ensemble transfer-learning approach was able to effectively 
discriminate AD from CN with 90.2% AUC, MCIc from CN with 83.2% AUC, and MCIc 
from MCInc with 70.6% AUC, showing comparable or slightly lower results with the 
fusion of conventional-ML systems (AD from CN with 93.1% AUC, MCIc from CN with 
89.6% AUC, and MCIc from MCInc with AUC in the range of 69.1-73.3%). The 
deep-learning network trained from scratch obtained lower performance than 
either the fusion of conventional-ML systems and the ensemble transfer-learning, 
due to the limited sample of images used for training. These results open new 
prospective on the use of transfer learning combined with neuroimages for the 
automatic early diagnosis and prognosis of AD, even if pretrained on generic 
images.

INTRODUCTION: We examined whether educational attainment differentially 
contributes to cognitive reserve (CR) across race/ethnicity.
METHODS: A total of 1553 non-Hispanic Whites (Whites), non-Hispanic Blacks 
(Blacks), and Hispanics in the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project 
(WHICAP) completed structural magnetic resonance imaging. Mixture growth curve 
modeling was used to examine whether the effect of brain integrity indicators 
(hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensity [WMH] 
volumes) on memory and language trajectories was modified by education across 
racial/ethnic groups.
RESULTS: Higher educational attainment attenuated the negative impact of WMH 
burden on memory (β = -0.03; 99% CI: -0.071, -0.002) and language decline 
(β = -0.024; 99% CI:- 0.044, -0.004), as well as the impact of cortical thinning 
on level of language performance for Whites, but not for Blacks or Hispanics.
DISCUSSION: Educational attainment does not contribute to CR similarly across 
racial/ethnic groups.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an incurable neurodegenerative disorder accounting 
for 70%-80% dementia cases worldwide. Although, research on AD has increased in 
recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and 
functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. 
Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging 
technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of 
neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is 
limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its 
applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively 
under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class 
classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, 
LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 
CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep 
learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate 
ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from 
scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning 
with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We 
experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and 
compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models 
is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found 
that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved 
improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an 
accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, 
LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively. However, in terms of overall performance, we 
achieved state-of-the-art results with an average accuracy of 97.92% and 97.88% 
for off-the-shelf and fine-tuned models respectively. The Analysis of results 
indicate that classification and prediction of neurodegenerative brain disorders 
such as AD using functional magnetic resonance imaging and advanced deep 
learning methods is promising for clinical decision making and have the 
potential to assist in early diagnosis of AD and its associated stages.

Apolipoproteins are involved in pathological conditions of Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), and it has been reported that truncated apolipoprotein fragments and 
β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides coexist as neurotoxic heteromers within the plaques. 
Therefore, it is important to investigate these complexes at the molecular level 
to better understand their properties and roles in the pathology of AD. Here, we 
present a mechanistic insight into such heteromerization using a structurally 
homologue apolipoprotein fragment of apoA-I (4F) complexed with Aβ(M1-42) and 
characterize their toxicity. The 4F peptide slows down the aggregation kinetics 
of Aβ(M1-42) by constraining its structural plasticity. NMR and CD experiments 
identified 4F-Aβ(M1-42) heteromers comprised of unstructured Aβ(M1-42) and 
helical 4F. A uniform two-fold reduction in 15N/1H NMR signal intensities of 
Aβ(M1-42) with no observable chemical shift perturbation indicated the formation 
of a large complex, which was further confirmed by diffusion NMR experiments. 
Microsecond-scale atomistic molecular dynamics simulations showed that 4F 
interaction with Aβ(M1-42) is electrostatically driven and induces unfolding of 
Aβ(M1-42). Neurotoxicity profiling of Aβ(M1-42) complexed with 4F confirms a 
significant reduction in cell viability and neurite growth. Thus, the molecular 
architecture of heteromerization between 4F and Aβ(M1-42) discovered in this 
study provides evidence toward our understanding of the role of apolipoproteins 
or their truncated fragments in exacerbating AD pathology.

INTRODUCTION: Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a tauopathy associated 
to repetitive head trauma. There are no validated in vivo biomarkers of CTE and 
a definite diagnosis can only be made at autopsy. Recent studies have shown that 
positron emission tomography (PET) tracer AV-1451 (Flortaucipir) exhibits high 
binding affinity for paired helical filament (PHF)-tau aggregates in Alzheimer 
(AD) brains but relatively low affinity for tau lesions in other tauopathies 
like temporal lobal degeneration (FTLD)-tau, progressive supranuclear palsy 
(PSP) or corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Little is known, however, about the 
binding profile of this ligand to the tau-containing lesions of CTE.
OBJECTIVE: To study the binding properties of [18F]-AV-1451 on pathologically 
confirmed CTE postmortem brain tissue samples.
METHODS: We performed [18F]-AV-1451 phosphor screen and high resolution 
autoradiography, quantitative tau measurements by immunohistochemistry and 
Western blot and tau seeding activity assays in brain blocks containing 
hippocampus, superior temporal cortex, superior frontal cortex, inferior 
parietal cortex and occipital cortex from 5 cases of CTE, across the stages of 
disease: stage II-III (n = 1), stage III (n = 3), and stage IV (n = 1). 
Importantly, low or no concomitant classic AD pathology was present in these 
brains.
RESULTS: Despite the presence of abundant tau aggregates in multiple regions in 
all CTE brains, only faint or no [18F]-AV-1451 binding signal could be detected 
by autoradiography. The only exception was the presence of a strong signal 
confined to the region of the choroid plexus and the meninges in two of the five 
cases. Tau immunostaining and Thioflavin-S staining ruled out the presence of 
tau aggregates in those regions. High resolution nuclear emulsion 
autoradiography revealed the presence of leptomeningeal melanocytes as the 
histologic source of this off-target binding. Levels of abnormally 
hyperphosphorylated tau species, as detected by Western Blotting, and tau 
seeding activity were both found to be lower in extracts from cases CTE when 
compared to AD.
CONCLUSION: AV-1451 may have limited utility for in vivo selective and reliable 
detection of tau aggregates in CTE. The existence of disease-specific tau 
conformations may likely explain the differential binding affinity of this 
tracer for tau lesions in different tauopathies.

BACKGROUND: To differentiate dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) from Alzheimer 
disease (AD) using a single imaging modality is challenging, because of their 
common hypometabolic findings. Scaled subprofile modeling/principal component 
analysis (SSM/PCA), an unsupervised artificial intelligence, has the potential 
to offer an alternative to image analysis.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to produce spatial metabolic profiles to discriminate DLB 
from AD and to identify the characteristics of the profiles.
METHODS: Fifty individuals each with DLB, AD, and normal cognition (NL) 
underwent 18F-FDG-PET and MRI. The spatial metabolic profile to differentiate 
DLB from AD (DLB-AD discrimination profile) was determined using SSM/PCA with 
tenfold cross validation. For comparison, we also produced disease-related 
profiles that can discriminate AD and DLB from NL (AD- and DLB-related profiles, 
respectively).
RESULTS: The DLB-AD discrimination profile significantly differentiated DLB from 
AD with comparable accuracy to that of discriminating DLB and AD from NL. The 
AD- and DLB-related profiles comprised metabolic imaging features typical of 
each pathology. In contrast, the DLB-AD discrimination profile emphasized 
preservation in the posterior cingulate cortex (cingulate island sign) and 
medial temporal lobe, and occipital hypometabolism. Common hypometabolic 
findings between DLB and AD were less noticeable in the profile. The DLB-related 
profile significantly correlated with cognitive function and three core features 
of DLB, whereas the DLB-AD discrimination profile did not.
CONCLUSIONS: Spatial metabolic profile that could discriminate DLB from AD 
emphasized different imaging features and eliminated common findings between DLB 
and AD. Neither cognitive function nor core features were associated with the 
profile.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases 
with a commonly seen prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase where 
memory loss is the main complaint progressively worsening with behavior issues 
and poor self-care. However, not all individuals clinically diagnosed with MCI 
progress to AD. A fraction of subjects with MCI either progress to non-AD 
dementia or remain stable at the MCI stage without progressing to dementia. 
Although a curative treatment of AD is currently unavailable, it is extremely 
important to correctly identify the individuals in the MCI phase that will go on 
to develop AD so that they may benefit from a curative treatment when one 
becomes available in the near future. At the same time, it would be highly 
desirable to also correctly identify those in the MCI phase that do not have AD 
pathology so they may be spared from unnecessary pharmocologic interventions 
that, at best, may provide them no benefit, and at worse, could further harm 
them with adverse side-effects. Additionally, it may be easier and simpler to 
identify the cause of the cognitive impairment in these non-AD cases, and hence 
proper identification of prodromal AD will be of benefit to these individuals as 
well. Fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) captures the 
metabolic activity of the brain, and this imaging modality has been reported to 
identify changes related to AD prior to the onset of structural changes. Prior 
work on designing classifier using FDG-PET imaging has been promising. Since 
deep-learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool to mine features and use 
them for accurate labeling of the group membership of given images, we propose a 
novel deep-learning framework using FDG-PET metabolism imaging to identify 
subjects at the MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and discriminate them from 
other subjects with MCI (non-AD / non-progressive). Our multiscale deep neural 
network obtained 82.51% accuracy of classification just using measures from a 
single modality (FDG-PET metabolism data) outperforming other comparable FDG-PET 
classifiers published in the recent literature.

Non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) is emerging as a promising rehabilitation 
tool for a number of neurodegenerative diseases. However, the therapeutic 
mechanisms of NIBS are not completely understood. In this review, we will 
summarize NIBS results in the context of brain imaging studies of functional 
connectivity and metabolites to gain insight into the possible mechanisms 
underlying recovery. We will briefly discuss how the clinical manifestations of 
common neurodegenerative disorders may be related with aberrant connectivity 
within large-scale neural networks. We will then focus on recent studies 
combining resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging with NIBS to 
delineate how stimulation of different brain regions induce complex network 
modifications, both at the local and distal level. Moreover, we will review 
studies combining magnetic resonance spectroscopy and NIBS to investigate how 
microscale changes are related to modifications of large-scale networks. 
Finally, we will re-examine previous NIBS studies in dementia in light of this 
network perspective. A better understanding of NIBS impact on the functionality 
of large-scale brain networks may be useful to design beneficial treatments for 
neurodegenerative disorders.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is widely regarded as an intermediate stage 
between typical aging and dementia, with nearly 50% of patients with amnestic 
MCI (aMCI) converting to Alzheimer's dementia (AD) within 30 months of follow-up 
(Fischer et al., 2007). The growing literature using resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging reveals both increased and decreased connectivity in 
individuals with MCI and connectivity loss between the anterior and posterior 
components of the default mode network (DMN) throughout the course of the 
disease progression (Hillary et al., 2015; Sheline & Raichle, 2013; Tijms et 
al., 2013). In this paper, we use dynamic connectivity modeling and graph theory 
to identify unique brain "states," or temporal patterns of connectivity across 
distributed networks, to distinguish individuals with aMCI from healthy older 
adults (HOAs). We enrolled 44 individuals diagnosed with aMCI and 33 HOAs of 
comparable age and education. Our results indicated that individuals with aMCI 
spent significantly more time in one state in particular, whereas neural network 
analysis in the HOA sample revealed approximately equivalent representation 
across four distinct states. Among individuals with aMCI, spending a higher 
proportion of time in the dominant state relative to a state where participants 
exhibited high cost (a measure combining connectivity and distance), predicted 
better language performance and less perseveration. This is the first report to 
examine neural network dynamics in individuals with aMCI.

Numerous studies have established that estimated brain age constitutes a 
valuable biomarker that is predictive of cognitive decline and various 
neurological diseases. In this work, we curate a large-scale brain MRI data set 
of healthy individuals, on which we train a uniform deep learning model for 
brain age estimation. We demonstrate an age estimation accuracy on a hold-out 
test set (mean absolute error = 4.06 years, r = 0.970) and an independent life 
span evaluation data set (mean absolute error = 4.21 years, r = 0.960). We 
further demonstrate the utility of the estimated age in a life span aging 
analysis of cognitive functions. In summary, we achieve age estimation 
performance comparable to previous studies, but with a more heterogenous data 
set confirming the efficacy of this deep learning framework. We also evaluated 
training with varying age distributions. The analysis of regional contributions 
to our brain age predictions through multiple analyses, and confirmation of the 
association of divergence between the estimated and chronological brain age with 
neuropsychological measures, may be useful in the development and evaluation of 
similar imaging biomarkers.

This study examined early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by diffusion 
tensor visualization-based methodology and neuro-fuzzy tools. Initially, we 
proposed a model for the early detection of AD using the measurement of apparent 
diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy, and gray matter, which can 
determine neurological disorder patterns and abnormalities in brain white 
matter. These are used as input parameters into fuzzy tools, and using fuzzy 
rules, we evaluate the AD score as an output variable that provides a useful 
platform to physicians in determining the status of the disease. In the second 
stage, we present an investigative study on AD and used the neuro-fuzzy 
classification system for pattern recognition of either AD or healthy control. 
The experimental results are from 20 samples (14 for training, 3 for validation, 
and 3 for testing) used in an artificial neural network classification system. 
The neural network is trained with a training algorithm and the performance of 
the training algorithm is obtained by executing a fuzzy expert system. Out of 20 
patients, 9 are AD patients and 11 are healthy control patients. We present a 
neuro-fuzzy tool as a better classifier for early detection of AD and obtain a 
satisfactory performance with 100% accuracy.

Collectively, vast quantities of brain imaging data exist across hospitals and 
research institutions, providing valuable resources to study brain disorders 
such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, in practice, putting all these 
distributed datasets into a centralized platform is infeasible due to patient 
privacy concerns, data restrictions and legal regulations. In this study, we 
propose a novel federated feature selection framework that can analyze the data 
at each individual institution without data-sharing or accessing private patient 
information. In this framework, we first propose a federated group lasso 
optimization method based on block coordinate descent. We employ stability 
selection to determine statistically significant features, by solving the group 
lasso problem with a sequence of regularization parameters. To accelerate the 
stability selection, we further propose a federated screening rule, which can 
identify and exclude the irrelevant features before solving the group lasso. 
Here, we use this framework for patch based feature selection on hippocampal 
morphometry. Shape is characterized through two different kinds of local 
measures, the radial distance and the surface area determined via tensor-based 
morphometry (TBM). The method is tested on 1,127 T1-weighted brain magnetic 
resonance images (MRI) of AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and elderly 
control subjects, randomly assigned to five independent hypothetical 
institutions for testing purpose. We examine the association of MRI-based 
anatomical measures with general cognitive assessment and amyloid burden to 
identify the morphometry changes related to AD deterioration and plaque 
accumulation. Finally, we visualize the significance of the association on the 
hippocampal surfaces. Our experimental results successfully demonstrate the 
efficiency and effectiveness of our method.

Segmentation of medical images using multiple atlases has recently gained 
immense attention due to their augmented robustness against variabilities across 
different subjects. These atlas-based methods typically comprise of three steps: 
atlas selection, image registration, and finally label fusion. Image 
registration is one of the core steps in this process, accuracy of which 
directly affects the final labeling performance. However, due to inter-subject 
anatomical variations, registration errors are inevitable. The aim of this paper 
is to develop a deep learning-based confidence estimation method to alleviate 
the potential effects of registration errors. We first propose a fully 
convolutional network (FCN) with residual connections to learn the relationship 
between the image patch pair (i.e., patches from the target subject and the 
atlas) and the related label confidence patch. With the obtained label 
confidence patch, we can identify the potential errors in the warped atlas 
labels and correct them. Then, we use two label fusion methods to fuse the 
corrected atlas labels. The proposed methods are validated on a publicly 
available dataset for hippocampus segmentation. Experimental results demonstrate 
that our proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art segmentation methods.

OBJECTIVE: Recent availability of amyloid and tau positron emission tomography 
(PET) has provided us with a unique opportunity to measure the association of 
systemic vascular health with brain health after accounting for the impact of 
Alzheimer disease (AD) pathologies. We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular 
health-related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, 
microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for 
cerebrovascular health.
METHODS: We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, 
n = 1,035) of individuals, aged ≥ 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with 
imaging from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We 
ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and 
metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart 
failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we 
quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, 
sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET).
RESULTS: Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe 
thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural 
integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and 
fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the 
genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular 
health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation 
datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid 
deposition.
INTERPRETATION: Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain 
structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health-related 
brain measures that are independent of AD pathology-related changes has great 
utility for cognitive aging. Ann Neurol 2018;84:713-724.

PURPOSE: Amyloid PET which has been widely used for noninvasive assessment of 
cortical amyloid burden is visually interpreted in the clinical setting. As a 
fast and easy-to-use visual interpretation support system, we analyze whether 
the deep learning-based end-to-end estimation of amyloid burden improves 
inter-reader agreement as well as the confidence of the visual reading.
METHODS: A total of 121 clinical routines [18F]Florbetaben PET images were 
collected for the randomized blind-reader study. The amyloid PET images were 
visually interpreted by three experts independently blind to other information. 
The readers qualitatively interpreted images without quantification at the first 
reading session. After more than 2-week interval, the readers additionally 
interpreted images with the quantification results provided by the deep learning 
system. The qualitative assessment was based on a 3-point BAPL score (1: no 
amyloid load, 2: minor amyloid load, and 3: significant amyloid load). The 
confidence score for each session was evaluated by a 3-point score (0: 
ambiguous, 1: probably, and 2: definite to decide).
RESULTS: Inter-reader agreements for the visual reading based on a 3-point scale 
(BAPL score) calculated by Fleiss kappa coefficients were 0.46 and 0.76 for the 
visual reading without and with the deep learning system, respectively. For the 
two reading sessions, the confidence score of visual reading was improved at the 
visual reading session with the output (1.27 ± 0.078 for visual reading-only 
session vs. 1.66 ± 0.63 for a visual reading session with the deep learning 
system).
CONCLUSION: Our results highlight the impact of deep learning-based one-step 
amyloid burden estimation system on inter-reader agreement and confidence of 
reading when applied to clinical routine amyloid PET reading.

Robust cross-subject emotion recognition based on multichannel EEG has always 
been hard work. In this work, we hypothesize that there exist default brain 
variables across subjects in emotional processes. Hence, the states of the 
latent variables that relate to emotional processing must contribute to building 
robust recognition models. Specifically, we propose to utilize an unsupervised 
deep generative model (e.g., variational autoencoder) to determine the latent 
factors from the multichannel EEG. Through a sequence modeling method, we 
examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. 
The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets 
(DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) 
and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that 
autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and 
our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As 
far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder 
into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition. We think the approach 
proposed in this work is not only feasible in emotion recognition but also 
promising in diagnosing depression, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive 
impairment, etc., whose specific latent processes may be altered or aberrant 
compared with the normal healthy control.

In this paper, we propose a novel method for magnetic resonance imaging based 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) diagnosis that 
systematically integrates voxel-based, region-based, and patch-based approaches 
into a unified framework. Specifically, we parcellate the brain into predefined 
regions based on anatomical knowledge (i.e., templates) and derive complex 
nonlinear relationships among voxels, whose intensities denote volumetric 
measurements, within each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or 
rectangular shapes, we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical 
patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each region 
learned by deep neural networks, we extract a "regional abnormality 
representation." We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the 
regional abnormality representations over the entire brain. It is noteworthy 
that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and 
understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping 
and visualizing these observations in the brain space. On the baseline MRI 
dataset from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort, our 
method achieves state-of-the-art performance for four binary classification 
tasks and one three-class classification task. Additionally, we conducted 
exhaustive experiments and analysis to validate the efficacy and potential of 
our method.

The deep grey matter (DGM) nuclei of the brain play a crucial role in learning, 
behaviour, cognition, movement and memory. Although automated segmentation 
strategies can provide insight into the impact of multiple neurological 
conditions affecting these structures, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), 
Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) 
and Cerebral Palsy (CP), there are a number of technical challenges limiting an 
accurate automated segmentation of the DGM. Namely, the insufficient contrast of 
T1 sequences to completely identify the boundaries of these structures, as well 
as the presence of iso-intense white matter lesions or extensive tissue loss 
caused by brain injury. Therefore in this systematic review, 269 eligible 
studies were analysed and compared to determine the optimal approaches for 
addressing these technical challenges. The automated approaches used among the 
reviewed studies fall into three broad categories, atlas-based approaches 
focusing on the accurate alignment of atlas priors, algorithmic approaches which 
utilise intensity information to a greater extent, and learning-based approaches 
that require an annotated training set. Studies that utilise freely available 
software packages such as FIRST, FreeSurfer and LesionTOADS were also eligible, 
and their performance compared. Overall, deep learning approaches achieved the 
best overall performance, however these strategies are currently hampered by the 
lack of large-scale annotated data. Improving model generalisability to new 
datasets could be achieved in future studies with data augmentation and transfer 
learning. Multi-atlas approaches provided the second-best performance overall, 
and may be utilised to construct a "silver standard" annotated training set for 
deep learning. To address the technical challenges, providing robustness to 
injury can be improved by using multiple channels, highly elastic diffeomorphic 
transformations such as LDDMM, and by following atlas-based approaches with an 
intensity driven refinement of the segmentation, which has been done with the 
Expectation Maximisation (EM) and level sets methods. Accounting for potential 
lesions should be achieved with a separate lesion segmentation approach, as in 
LesionTOADS. Finally, to address the issue of limited contrast, R2*, T2* and QSM 
sequences could be used to better highlight the DGM due to its higher iron 
content. Future studies could look to additionally acquire these sequences by 
retaining the phase information from standard structural scans, or alternatively 
acquiring these sequences for only a training set, allowing models to learn the 
"improved" segmentation from T1-sequences alone.

Converging evidence from structural, metabolic and functional connectivity MRI 
suggests that neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, target 
specific neural networks. However, age-related network changes commonly co-occur 
with neuropathological cascades, limiting efforts to disentangle 
disease-specific alterations in network function from those associated with 
normal ageing. Here we elucidate the differential effects of ageing and 
Alzheimer's disease pathology through simultaneous analyses of two functional 
connectivity MRI datasets: (i) young participants harbouring highly-penetrant 
mutations leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease from the Dominantly 
Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an Alzheimer's disease cohort in which 
age-related comorbidities are minimal and likelihood of progression along an 
Alzheimer's disease trajectory is extremely high; and (ii) young and elderly 
participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort in which imaging 
biomarkers of amyloid burden and neurodegeneration can be used to disambiguate 
ageing alone from preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Consonant with prior reports, 
we observed the preferential degradation of cognitive (especially the default 
and dorsal attention networks) over motor and sensory networks in early 
autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, and found that this distinctive 
degradation pattern was magnified in more advanced stages of disease. 
Importantly, a nascent form of the pattern observed across the 
autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease spectrum was also detectable in 
clinically normal elderly with clear biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease 
pathology (preclinical Alzheimer's disease). At the more granular level of 
individual connections between node pairs, we observed that connections within 
cognitive networks were preferentially targeted in Alzheimer's disease (with 
between network connections relatively spared), and that connections between 
positively coupled nodes (correlations) were preferentially degraded as compared 
to connections between negatively coupled nodes (anti-correlations). In 
contrast, ageing in the absence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers was 
characterized by a far less network-specific degradation across cognitive and 
sensory networks, of between- and within-network connections, and of connections 
between positively and negatively coupled nodes. We go on to demonstrate that 
formalizing the differential patterns of network degradation in ageing and 
Alzheimer's disease may have the practical benefit of yielding connectivity 
measurements that highlight early Alzheimer's disease-related connectivity 
changes over those due to age-related processes. Together, the contrasting 
patterns of connectivity in Alzheimer's disease and ageing add to prior work 
arguing against Alzheimer's disease as a form of accelerated ageing, and suggest 
multi-network composite functional connectivity MRI metrics may be useful in the 
detection of early Alzheimer's disease-specific alterations co-occurring with 
age-related connectivity changes. More broadly, our findings are consistent with 
a specific pattern of network degradation associated with the spreading of 
Alzheimer's disease pathology within targeted neural networks.

Cognitive malfunction, synaptic dysfunction, and disconnections in neural 
networks are core deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). 5xFAD mice, a transgenic 
model of AD, are characterized by an enhanced level of amyloid-β and abnormal 
neurotransmission. The dopaminergic (DA) system has been shown to be involved in 
amyloid-β transformations and neuronal plasticity; however, its role in 
functional network changes in familial AD still remains unclear. In 5xFAD and 
non-transgenic freely moving mice, electroencephalograms (EEGs) were 
simultaneously recorded from the secondary motor cortex (MC), superficial layers 
of the hippocampal CA1 area (HPC), substantia nigra (SN), and ventral tegmental 
area (VTA). EEGs and their frequency spectra were analyzed before and after 
systemic injection of a DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO). In the baseline 
EEG from MC and HPC of 5xFAD mice, delta and alpha oscillations were enhanced 
and beta activity was attenuated, compared to control mice. In VTA and SN of 
5xFAD mice, delta-theta activity was decreased and beta oscillations dominated. 
In control mice, APO suppressed delta activity in VTA to a higher extent than in 
MC, whereas in 5xFAD mice, this difference was eliminated due to attenuation of 
the delta suppression in VTA. APO increased beta activity in MC of mice from 
both groups while significant beta suppression was observed in VTA of 5xFAD 
mice. These mice were characterized by significant decrease of tyrosine 
hydroxylase immunopositive cells in both VTA and SN and of DA transporter in MC 
and hippocampal dentate gyrus. We suggest that the EEG modifications observed in 
5xFAD mice are associated with alterations in dopaminergic transmission, 
resulting in adaptive changes in the cerebral networks in the course of familial 
AD development.

Brain structural morphology differs with age. This study examined 
age-differences in surface-based morphometric measures of cortical thickness, 
volume, and surface area in a well-defined sample of 8137 generally healthy UK 
Biobank participants aged 45-79 years. We illustrate that the complexity of 
age-related brain morphological differences may be related to the laminar 
organization and regional evolutionary history of the cortex, and age of about 
60 is a break point for increasing negative associations between age and brain 
morphology in Alzheimer's disease (AD)-prone areas. We also report novel 
relationships of age-related cortical differences with individual factors of 
sex, cognitive functions of fluid intelligence, reaction time and prospective 
memory, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep disruption, genetic 
markers of apolipoprotein E, brain-derived neurotrophic factor, 
catechol-O-methyltransferase, and several genome-wide association study loci for 
AD and further reveal joint effects of cognitive functions, lifestyle behaviors, 
and education on age-related cortical differences. These findings provide one of 
the most extensive characterizations of age associations with major brain 
morphological measures and improve our understanding of normal structural brain 
aging and its potential modifiers.

BACKGROUND: Pathological processes contributing to Alzheimer's disease begin 
decades prior to the onset of clinical symptoms. There is significant variation 
in cognitive changes in the presence of pathology, functional connectivity may 
be a marker of compensation to amyloid; however, this is not well understood.
METHODS: We recruited 64 cognitively normal older adults who underwent 
neuropsychological testing and biannual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), 
amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET, and glucose metabolism 
(FDG)-PET imaging for up to 6 years. Resting-state MRI was used to estimate 
connectivity of seven canonical neural networks using template-based rotation. 
Using voxel-wise paired t-tests, we identified neural networks that displayed 
significant changes in connectivity across time. We investigated associations 
among amyloid and longitudinal changes in connectivity and cognitive function by 
domains.
RESULTS: Left middle frontal gyrus connectivity within the memory encoding 
network increased over time, but the rate of change was lower with greater 
amyloid. This was no longer significant in an analysis where we limited the 
sample to only those with two time points. We found limited decline in cognitive 
domains overall. Greater functional connectivity was associated with better 
attention/processing speed and executive function (independent of time) in those 
with lower amyloid but was associated with worse function with greater amyloid.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased functional connectivity serves to preserve cognitive 
function in normal aging and may fail in the presence of pathology consistent 
with compensatory models.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder without a cure or 
prevention to date. Hyperphosphorylated tau forms the neurofibrillary tangles 
(NFTs) that correlate well with the progression of cognitive impairments. Animal 
studies demonstrated the pathogenic role of hyperphosphorylated tau. 
Understanding how abnormal phosphorylation renders a normal tau prone to form 
toxic fibrils is key to delineating molecular pathology and to developing 
efficacious drugs for AD. Production of a tau bearing the disease-relevant 
hyperphosphorylation and molecular characters is a pivotal step. Here, we report 
the preparation and characterization of a recombinant hyperphosphorylated tau 
(p-tau) with strong relevance to disease. P-tau generated by the PIMAX approach 
resulted in phosphorylation at multiple epitopes linked to the progression of AD 
neuropathology. In stark contrast to unmodified tau that required an aggregation 
inducer, and which had minimal effects on cell functions, p-tau formed 
inducer-free fibrils that triggered a spike of mitochondrial superoxide, induced 
apoptosis, and caused cell death at sub-micromolar concentrations. P-tau-induced 
apoptosis was suppressed by inhibitors for reactive oxygen species. 
Hyperphosphorylation apparently caused rapid formation of a disease-related 
conformation. In both aggregation and cytotoxicity, p-tau exhibited seeding 
activities that converted the unmodified tau into a cytotoxic species with an 
increased propensity for fibrillization. These characters of p-tau are 
consistent with the emerging view that hyperphosphorylation causes tau to become 
an aggregation-prone and cytotoxic species that underlies diffusible pathology 
in AD and other tauopathies. Our results further suggest that p-tau affords a 
feasible tool for Alzheimer's disease mechanistic and drug discovery studies.

Computational models predicting symptomatic progression at the individual level 
can be highly beneficial for early intervention and treatment planning for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors 
including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we 
present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) 
modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using 
multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts 
from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication 
analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship 
Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes 
using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and 
Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over 
six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict 
these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) 
imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + 
follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network 
(LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two 
timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three 
(stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 
assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate 
performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 
accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 
0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, with no effective 
treatment currently available. However, targeting the aging mechanism may 
improve outcomes and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system alteration could have 
implications for treatment of cognitive decline in old age. We studied the 
effects of the GABA system on brain activity in aged APP and PS1 transgenic 
mice. Low dose (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) GABAA agonist muscimol and antagonist 
bicuculline were administered for moderate system activation and inhibition, 
respectively. EEGs from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were 
recorded under spontaneous state and during Y-maze performance. Basally, AD mice 
exhibited increased spontaneous EEG delta (2-4 Hz) and decreased spontaneous EEG 
alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the Hip, and decreased Y-maze EEG theta (4-8 Hz) 
activity in the PFC. Interestingly, GABAA activation and inhibition in AD mice 
reduced EEG delta activity and increased EEG theta activity in the PFC, and 
behaviorally improved spatial recognition memory during Y-maze testing. 
Decreased spontaneous EEG delta activity was also observed in the PFC. 
Specifically, GABAA activation primarily affected low frequency EEG (2-12 Hz) 
activity in the PFC, whereas inhibition affected EEG activity across many 
frequencies in the PFC and Hip. These data provide evidence for slower brain 
activity in AD mice. Importantly, improved spatial memory after GABAA activation 
and inhibition may be explained by brain rhythm recovery in certain regions. Our 
study highlights the potential clinical use of GABAA drugs to improve cognitive 
disorders and restore neural network activity in AD.

OBJECTIVE: To provide an up-to-date systematic review of the characteristics, 
methodology and findings of studies that have investigated the neurochemistry of 
agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
METHODS: Electronic databases were searched for published peer-reviewed articles 
which provided data on any neurotransmitter system in relation to agitation in 
AD. Screening of titles and abstracts and data extraction from full texts were 
conducted in duplicate.
RESULTS: Forty-five studies were included. Monoamines (serotonin, dopamine and 
noradrenaline) were most commonly investigated. A variety of methods were used 
to investigate the neurochemistry underlying agitation in AD and, although there 
were several conflicting findings, there was evidence of serotonergic deficit, 
relatively preserved dopaminergic function and compensatory overactivity of 
postsynaptic noradrenergic neurons in agitation in AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Disruption of the dynamic balance between multiple neurotransmitter 
systems could impair functional neural networks involved in affective regulation 
and executive function. Differences in study design and methodology may have 
contributed to conflicting findings. Future studies that overcome these 
limitations (e.g. using standardized criteria to define agitation) and employ 
neuroimaging methods such as MRI/PET to investigate specific neural networks are 
needed to clarify the role of neurotransmitter alterations in these patients.

Alzheimer's disease is considered a disconnection syndrome, motivating the use 
of brain network measures to detect changes in whole-brain resting state 
functional connectivity (FC). We investigated changes in FC within and among 
resting state networks (RSN) across four different stages in the Alzheimer's 
disease continuum. FC changes were examined in two independent cohorts of 
individuals (84 and 58 individuals, respectively) each comprising control, 
subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's dementia 
groups. For each participant, FC was computed as a matrix of Pearson 
correlations between pairs of time series from 278 gray matter brain regions. We 
determined significant differences in FC modular organization with two distinct 
approaches, network contingency analysis and multiresolution consensus 
clustering. Network contingency analysis identified RSN sub-blocks that differed 
significantly across clinical groups. Multiresolution consensus clustering 
identified differences in the stability of modules across multiple spatial 
scales. Significant modules were further tested for statistical association with 
memory and executive function cognitive domain scores. Across both analytic 
approaches and in both participant cohorts, the findings converged on a pattern 
of FC that varied systematically with diagnosis within the frontoparietal 
network (FP) and between the FP network and default mode network (DMN). 
Disturbances of modular organization were manifest as greater internal coherence 
of the FP network and stronger coupling between FP and DMN, resulting in less 
segregation of these two networks. Our findings suggest that the pattern of 
interactions within and between specific RSNs offers new insight into the 
functional disruption that occurs across the Alzheimer's disease spectrum.

OBJECTIVE: Amyloid-β plaques and neurofibrillary tangles composed of tau protein 
are the neuropathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, 
marked progress has been made in Alzheimer's disease research using tau ligands 
for positron emission tomography (PET). However, the issue of off-target 
binding, that is, the binding of ligands to regions without tau pathology, 
remains unresolved. Tissues with melanin-containing cells (MCCs) have been 
suggested as binding targets for tau ligands. In the present study, we 
characterized the MCC-binding properties of representative tau PET ligands.
METHODS: Autoradiographic studies of [18F]AV-1451 and [18F]THK5351 were 
conducted using postmortem human midbrain sections. Saturation-binding assays of 
[18F]AV-1451 and [18F]THK5351 were performed with B16F10 melanoma cells. The 
blocking effects of 25 compounds against [18F]THK5351 binding to B16F10 cells 
were used to investigate the relationship between chemical structure and MCC 
binding.
RESULTS: Autoradiography demonstrated specific binding of the radioligands in 
the substantia nigra. [18F]AV-1451 and [18F]THK5351 exhibited saturable binding 
to melanoma cells ([18F]AV-1451: Kd = 669 ± 196 nM, Bmax = 622 ± 269 pmol/mg 
protein; [18F]THK5351: Kd = 441 ± 126 nM, Bmax = 559 ± 75.5 pmol/mg protein). In 
blocking studies with melanoma cells, compounds bearing multiple aromatic rings 
and an aminopyridine group, including tau ligands such as AV-1451, PBB3, and a 
lead compound of MK-6240, exhibited the inhibition of [18F]THK5351 binding 
comparable to self-blocking by THK5351 (> 70% at 10 µM).
CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that the binding properties of [18F]AV-1451 
and [18F]THK5351 are sufficient to expect highlighting of tissues with a high 
density of MCCs. The findings of the present study should aid the development of 
neuroimaging ligands that do not bind to MCC.

PURPOSE: Severity of white matter lesion (WML) is typically evaluated on 
magnetic resonance images (MRI), yet the more accessible, faster, and less 
expensive method is computed tomography (CT). Our objective was to study whether 
WML can be automatically segmented from CT images using a convolutional neural 
network (CNN). The second aim was to compare CT segmentation with MRI 
segmentation.
METHODS: The brain images from the Helsinki University Hospital clinical image 
archive were systematically screened to make CT-MRI image pairs. Selection 
criteria for the study were that both CT and MRI images were acquired within 
6 weeks. In total, 147 image pairs were included. We used CNN to segment WML 
from CT images. Training and testing of CNN for CT was performed using 10-fold 
cross-validation, and the segmentation results were compared with the 
corresponding segmentations from MRI.
RESULTS: A Pearson correlation of 0.94 was obtained between the automatic WML 
volumes of MRI and CT segmentations. The average Dice similarity index 
validating the overlap between CT and FLAIR segmentations was 0.68 for the 
Fazekas 3 group.
CONCLUSION: CNN-based segmentation of CT images may provide a means to evaluate 
the severity of WML and establish a link between CT WML patterns and the current 
standard MRI-based visual rating scale.

PURPOSE: Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) and Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) are geriatric diseases and common causes of dementia. Recently, many 
studies on the segmentation, disease detection, or classification of MRI using 
deep learning have been conducted. The aim of this study was to differentiate 
iNPH and AD using a residual extraction approach in the deep learning method.
METHODS: Twenty-three patients with iNPH, 23 patients with AD and 23 healthy 
controls were included in this study. All patients and volunteers underwent 
brain MRI with a 3T unit, and we used only whole-brain three-dimensional (3D) 
T1-weighted images. We designed a fully automated, end-to-end 3D deep learning 
classifier to differentiate iNPH, AD and control. We evaluated the performance 
of our model using a leave-one-out cross-validation test. We also evaluated the 
validity of the result by visualizing important areas in the process of 
differentiating AD and iNPH on the original input image using the 
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique.
RESULTS: Twenty-one out of 23 iNPH cases, 19 out of 23 AD cases and 22 out of 23 
controls were correctly diagnosed. The accuracy was 0.90. In the Grad-CAM heat 
map, brain parenchyma surrounding the lateral ventricle was highlighted in about 
half of the iNPH cases that were successfully diagnosed. The medial temporal 
lobe or inferior horn of the lateral ventricle was highlighted in many 
successfully diagnosed cases of AD. About half of the successful cases showed 
nonspecific heat maps.
CONCLUSION: Residual extraction approach in a deep learning method achieved a 
high accuracy for the differential diagnosis of iNPH, AD, and healthy controls 
trained with a small number of cases.

Dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) is associated with devastating and 
irreversible cognitive decline. Predicting which patients with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) will progress to DAT is an ongoing challenge in the field. We 
developed a deep learning model to predict conversion from MCI to DAT. 
Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were used as input to a 
3-dimensional convolutional neural network. The 3-dimensional convolutional 
neural network was trained using transfer learning; in the source task, normal 
control and DAT scans were used to pretrain the model. This pretrained model was 
then retrained on the target task of classifying which MCI patients converted to 
DAT. Our model resulted in 82.4% classification accuracy at the target task, 
outperforming current models in the field. Next, we visualized brain regions 
that significantly contribute to the prediction of MCI conversion using an 
occlusion map approach. Contributory regions included the pons, amygdala, and 
hippocampus. Finally, we showed that the model's prediction value is 
significantly correlated with rates of change in clinical assessment scores, 
indicating that the model is able to predict an individual patient's future 
cognitive decline. This information, in conjunction with the identified 
anatomical features, will aid in building a personalized therapeutic strategy 
for individuals with MCI.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical state with a high risk of 
conversion to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Since there is no effective treatment 
for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this 
makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging 
to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain 
structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract 
remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality 
diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to 
use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the 
multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based 
on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the 
multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature 
dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, 
the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. 
Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful 
information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and 
the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial 
to early intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as 
an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical diagnosis.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an age-related disease with modifiable risk factors 
such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity, and physical inactivity 
influencing the onset and progression. There is however, no direct evidence that 
reducing these risk factors prevents or slows AD. The Risk Reduction for 
Alzheimer's Disease (rrAD) trial is designed to study the independent and 
combined effects of intensive pharmacological control of blood pressure and 
cholesterol and exercise training on neurocognitive function. Six hundred and 
forty cognitively normal older adults age 60 to 85 years with hypertension and 
increased risk for dementia will be enrolled. Participants are randomized into 
one of four intervention group for two years: usual care, Intensive Reduction of 
Vascular Risk factors (IRVR) with blood pressure and cholesterol reduction, 
exercise training (EX), and IRVR+EX. Neurocognitive function is measured at 
baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months; brain MRIs are obtained at baseline and 
24 months. We hypothesize that both IRVR and EX will improve global cognitive 
function, while IRVR+EX will provide a greater benefit than either IRVR or EX 
alone. We also hypothesize that IRVR and EX will slow brain atrophy, improve 
brain structural and functional connectivity, and improve brain perfusion. 
Finally, we will explore the mechanisms by which study interventions impact 
neurocognition and brain. If rrAD interventions are shown to be safe, practical, 
and successful, our study will have a significant impact on reducing the risks 
of AD in older adults. NCT Registration: NCT02913664.

INTRODUCTION: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) is 
commonly used to estimate neuronal injury in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we 
evaluate the utility of dynamic PET measures of perfusion using 11C-Pittsburgh 
compound B (PiB) to estimate neuronal injury in comparison to FDG PET.
METHODS: FDG, early frames of PiB images, and relative PiB delivery rate 
constants (PiB-R1) were obtained from 110 participants from the Dominantly 
Inherited Alzheimer Network. Voxelwise, regional cross-sectional, and 
longitudinal analyses were done to evaluate the correlation between images and 
estimate the relationship of the imaging biomarkers with estimated time to 
disease progression based on family history.
RESULTS: Metabolism and perfusion images were spatially correlated. Regional 
PiB-R1 values and FDG, but not early frames of PiB images, significantly 
decreased in the mutation carriers with estimated year to onset and with 
increasing dementia severity.
DISCUSSION: Hypometabolism estimated by PiB-R1 may provide a measure of brain 
perfusion without increasing radiation exposure.

Hierarchical Fully Convolutional Network for Joint Atrophy Localization and 
Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis Using Structural MRI.

Lian C, Liu M, Zhang J, Shen D.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has been widely used for 
computer-aided diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders, e.g., Alzheimer's 
disease (AD), due to its sensitivity to morphological changes caused by brain 
atrophy. Recently, a few deep learning methods (e.g., convolutional neural 
networks, CNNs) have been proposed to learn task-oriented features from sMRI for 
AD diagnosis, and achieved superior performance than the conventional 
learning-based methods using hand-crafted features. However, these existing 
CNN-based methods still require the pre-determination of informative locations 
in sMRI. That is, the stage of discriminative atrophy localization is isolated 
to the latter stages of feature extraction and classifier construction. In this 
paper, we propose a hierarchical fully convolutional network (H-FCN) to 
automatically identify discriminative local patches and regions in the whole 
brain sMRI, upon which multi-scale feature representations are then jointly 
learned and fused to construct hierarchical classification models for AD 
diagnosis. Our proposed H-FCN method was evaluated on a large cohort of subjects 
from two independent datasets (i.e., ADNI-1 and ADNI-2), demonstrating good 
performance on joint discriminative atrophy localization and brain disease 
diagnosis.

We develop three efficient approaches for generating visual explanations from 3D 
convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for Alzheimer's disease classification. 
One approach conducts sensitivity analysis on hierarchical 3D image 
segmentation, and the other two visualize network activations on a spatial map. 
Visual checks and a quantitative localization benchmark indicate that all 
approaches identify important brain parts for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. 
Comparative analysis show that the sensitivity analysis based approach has 
difficulty handling loosely distributed cerebral cortex, and approaches based on 
visualization of activations are constrained by the resolution of the 
convo-lutional layer. The complementarity of these methods improves the 
understanding of 3D-CNNs in Alzheimer's disease classification from different 
perspectives.

OBJECTIVE: To study risk factors for decreasing aβ1-42 concentrations in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in cognitively unimpaired individuals with initially 
normal amyloid and tau markers, and to investigate whether such aβ1-42 decreases 
are associated with subsequent decline in cognition and other biomarkers of 
Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Cognitively normal subjects (n = 83, 75 ± 5 years, 35(42%) female) with 
normal CSF aβ1-42 and tau and repeated CSF sampling were selected from ADNI. 
Subject level slopes of aβ1-42 decreases were estimated with mixed models. We 
tested associations of baseline APP processing markers (BACE1 activity, aβ1-40, 
aβ1-38 and sAPP β) and decreasing aβ1-42 levels by including an interaction term 
between time and APP marker. Associations between decreasing aβ1-42 levels and 
clinical decline (i.e., progression to mild cognitive impairment or dementia, 
MMSE, memory functioning) and biological decline (tau, hippocampal volume, 
glucose processing and amyloid PET) over a time period of 8-10 years were 
assessed.
RESULTS: Aβ1-42 levels decreased annually with -4.6 ± 1 pg/mL. Higher baseline 
BACE1 activity (β(se) = -0.06(0.03), P < 0.05), aβ1-40 (β(se)= -0.11(.03), P < 
0.001), and aβ1-38 levels (β(se) = -0.11(0.03), P < 0.001) predicted faster 
decreasing aβ1-42. The fastest tertile of decreasing aβ1-42 rates was associated 
with subsequent pathophysiological processes: 11(14%) subjects developed 
abnormal amyloid levels after 3 ± 1.7 years, showed increased risk for clinical 
progression (Hazard Ratio[95CI] = 4.8[1.1-21.0]), decreases in MMSE, glucose 
metabolism and hippocampal volume, and increased CSF tau and amyloid aggregation 
on PET (all P < 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: Higher APP processing and fast decreasing aβ1-42 could be among 
the earliest, pre-amyloid, pathological changes in Alzheimer's disease.

PURPOSE: It is usually easy to judge whether amyloid PET images should be 
interpreted as positive or negative for amyloid deposits by visual inspection or 
quantitative measurement standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), but the findings 
are equivocal in some cases. As conventional mean cortical SUVR (mcSUVR) 
measures accumulation in both gray matter (GM) and white matter, it may 
mis-estimate amyloid deposits. The purpose of the study was to develop a 
regional GM-dedicated SUVR measuring (GMSUVR) system for amyloid PET images with 
3D-MRI, and evaluate its utility for detecting amyloid deposits in equivocal 
cases.
METHODS: Of 126 subjects who underwent amyloid PET with 11C-PiB and 3D-MRI, the 
area of amyloid-positive regions and the critical regional GMSUVR thresholds 
were first determined in 15 amyloid-positive and 15 amyloid-negative patients, 
using the automatic volumetric measurement of segmented brain images system. We 
then tested 36 amyloid-negative, 60 amyloid-positive, and 13 equivocal subjects 
with this GMSUVR system and with conventional mcSUVR.
RESULTS: Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value (PPV) and 
negative predictive value (NPV) were 100%, 92%, 97%, 95%, and 100% for the 
GMSUVR system; and 97%, 86%, 93%, 92% and 94%, respectively, for mcSUVR. In 24 
cases in which the findings were equivocal or discordant, the sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, PPV, and NPV were all 100% for the GMSUVR system; and 
were 90%, 33%, 83%, 90%, and 33%, respectively, for mcSUVR.
CONCLUSION: The regional GMSUVR measurement method was well able to discriminate 
between amyloid-positive and -negative subjects, even in cases where amyloid 
deposition was equivocal.

We describe the Open Diffusion Data Derivatives (O3D) repository: an integrated 
collection of preserved brain data derivatives and processing pipelines, 
published together using a single digital-object-identifier. The data 
derivatives were generated using modern diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging data (dMRI) with diverse properties of resolution and signal-to-noise 
ratio. In addition to the data, we publish all processing pipelines (also 
referred to as open cloud services). The pipelines utilize modern methods for 
neuroimaging data processing (diffusion-signal modelling, fiber tracking, 
tractography evaluation, white matter segmentation, and structural connectome 
construction). The O3D open services can allow cognitive and clinical 
neuroscientists to run the connectome mapping algorithms on new, user-uploaded, 
data. Open source code implementing all O3D services is also provided to allow 
computational and computer scientists to reuse and extend the processing 
methods. Publishing both data-derivatives and integrated processing pipeline 
promotes practices for scientific reproducibility and data upcycling by 
providing open access to the research assets for utilization by multiple 
scientific communities.

MOTIVATION: The multimodal data fusion analysis becomes another important field 
for brain disease detection and increasing researches concentrate on using 
neural network algorithms to solve a range of problems. However, most current 
neural network optimizing strategies focus on internal nodes or hidden layer 
numbers, while ignoring the advantages of external optimization. Additionally, 
in the multimodal data fusion analysis of brain science, the problems of small 
sample size and high-dimensional data are often encountered due to the 
difficulty of data collection and the specialization of brain science data, 
which may result in the lower generalization performance of neural network.
RESULTS: We propose a genetically evolved random neural network cluster (GERNNC) 
model. Specifically, the fusion characteristics are first constructed to be 
taken as the input and the best type of neural network is selected as the base 
classifier to form the initial random neural network cluster. Second, the 
cluster is adaptively genetically evolved. Based on the GERNNC model, we further 
construct a multi-tasking framework for the classification of patients with 
brain disease and the extraction of significant characteristics. In a study of 
genetic data and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the framework exhibits great classification 
performance and strong morbigenous factor detection ability. This work 
demonstrates that how to effectively detect pathogenic components of the brain 
disease on the high-dimensional medical data and small samples.

The aim of this work is to develop a Computer-Aided-Brain-Diagnosis (CABD) 
system that can determine if a brain scan shows signs of Alzheimer's disease. 
The method utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) for classification with 
several feature extraction techniques. MRI is a non-invasive procedure, widely 
adopted in hospitals to examine cognitive abnormalities. Images are acquired 
using the T2 imaging sequence. The paradigm consists of a series of quantitative 
techniques: filtering, feature extraction, Student's t-test based feature 
selection, and k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) based classification. Additionally, a 
comparative analysis is done by implementing other feature extraction procedures 
that are described in the literature. Our findings suggest that the Shearlet 
Transform (ST) feature extraction technique offers improved results for 
Alzheimer's diagnosis as compared to alternative methods. The proposed CABD tool 
with the ST + KNN technique provided accuracy of 94.54%, precision of 88.33%, 
sensitivity of 96.30% and specificity of 93.64%. Furthermore, this tool also 
offered an accuracy, precision, sensitivity and specificity of 98.48%, 100%, 
96.97% and 100%, respectively, with the benchmark MRI database.

BACKGROUND: The identification of early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), which 
is an early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is associated with brain 
structural and functional changes, is still a challenging task. Recent studies 
show great promises for improving the performance of EMCI identification by 
combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter 
volume and shortest path length. However, extracting which features and how to 
combine multiple features to improve the performance of EMCI identification have 
always been a challenging problem. To address this problem, in this study we 
propose a new EMCI identification framework using multi-modal data and graph 
convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly, we extract grey matter volume and 
shortest path length of each brain region based on automated anatomical labeling 
(AAL) atlas as feature representation from T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each 
subject, respectively. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful 
in identifying EMCI, a common multi-task feature selection method is applied. 
Afterwards, we construct a non-fully labelled subject graph using imaging and 
non-imaging phenotypic measures of each subject. Finally, a GCN model is adopted 
to perform the EMCI identification task.
RESULTS: Our proposed EMCI identification method is evaluated on 210 subjects, 
including 105 subjects with EMCI and 105 normal controls (NCs), with both T1w 
MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 
database. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves an 
accuracy of 84.1% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) 
curve (AUC) of 0.856 for EMCI/NC classification. In addition, by comparison, the 
accuracy and AUC values of our proposed framework are better than those of some 
existing methods in EMCI identification.
CONCLUSION: Our proposed EMCI identification framework is effective and 
promising for automatic diagnosis of EMCI in clinical practice.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate the impact of the epsilon 
phenotype in brain glucose consumption in a population with Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM8) was used to investigate 
differences in brain glucose consumption (as detectable by means of 18F 
FDG-PET/CT) in the population examined. A total of 129 patients (72 females and 
57 males) with a diagnosis of probable AD according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria 
underwent the PET/CT examination. The mean (SD) age of the patients was 70 (± 7) 
years; the mean Mini-Mental State Examination was 19(± 5.6). 59 expressed 
epsilon 4 phenotype (E4) and 70 expressed the epsilon 3 phenotype (E3). Cerebral 
spinal fluid amyloid, tau, and t-tau have been measured resulting equal to 367.4 
(± 149.1), 584.7 (± 312.1), and 79.2(± 45.9) pg/ml, respectively. Patients with 
confirmed amyloid and Tau changes were classified as AD. Patients with amyloid 
changes but negative Tau, considered as high risk of AD, were classified as IAD. 
Age, sex, MMSE, scholarship, and CSF parameters were used as a covariate in the 
SPM analyses.
RESULTS: We did not find significant differences in age, gender, and MMSE and 
CSF parameters among groups. In the analysis of the AD group as compared to 
AD-E3, AD-E4 subjects show a significant reduction of brain glucose consumption 
in inferior frontal gyrus bilaterally (BA 45, BA 47). In the analysis of the IAD 
group as compared to IAD-E3, IAD-E4 subjects show a significant reduction of 
brain glucose consumption in right in medial, middle, and superior frontal gyrus 
(BA10, BA11), and in left medial and middle frontal gyrus (BA10, BA11). The 
differences between IAD-E3 and AD-E3 and between IAD-E4 and AD-E4 (and vice 
versa analysis) resulted not significant.
CONCLUSIONS: APO-e4 is related to a major involvement of the frontal cortex 
confirming its role of risk factor in AD, while APO-3 seems not related to a 
specific pattern, supporting the hypothesis of neutral/protective role in AD.

Resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rs-fcMRI) is a non-invasive imaging 
technique that has come into increasing use to understand disrupted neural 
network function in neuropsychiatric disease. However, despite extensive study 
over the past 15 years, the development of rs-fcMRI as a biomarker has been 
impeded by a lack of reliable longitudinal rs-fcMRI measures. Here we focus on 
longitudinal change along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectory and 
demonstrate the utility of Template Based Rotation (TBR) in detecting 
differential longitudinal rs-fcMRI change between higher and lower amyloid 
burden individuals with mildly impaired cognition. Specifically, we examine a 
small (N = 24), but densely sampled (~5 observations over ~3 years), cohort of 
symptomatic individuals with serial rs-fcMRI imaging and PiB-PET imaging for 
β-amyloid pathology. We observed longitudinal decline of the Default Mode and 
Salience network axis (DMN/SAL) among impaired individuals with high amyloid 
burden. No other networks showed differential change in high vs. low amyloid 
individuals over time. The standardized effect size of AD related DMN/SAL change 
is comparable to the standardized effect size of amyloid-related change on the 
mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and hippocampal volume (HV). Last, we show that 
the AD-related change in DMN/SAL connectivity is almost completely independent 
of change on MMSE or HV, suggesting that rs-fcMRI is sensitive to an aspect of 
AD progression that is not captured by these other measures. Together these 
analyses demonstrate that longitudinal rs-fcMRI using TBR can capture 
disease-relevant network disruption in a clinical population.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) offers significant insight into the complex 
organization of neural networks within the human brain. Using resting-state 
functional MRI data, topological maps can be created to visualize changes in 
brain activity, as well as to represent and assess the structural and functional 
connections between different brain regions. Crucially, Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
is associated with progressive loss in this connectivity, which is particularly 
evident within the default mode network. In this paper, we review the recent 
literature on how factors that are associated with risk of dementia may 
influence the organization of the brain network structures. In particular, we

Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) 
are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple neurological symptoms 
that may lead to controversial diagnoses when using conventional clinical and 
MRI criteria. Therefore, other approaches are needed to overcome this issue. 
Machine learning (ML) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been 
shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, 
including dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether 
different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features, could be 
supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the developed approach 
might help in predicting the prevalent disease in subjects with an unclear 
profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of algorithms were tested: artificial 
neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy 
inference system (ANFIS). Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI 
(rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were 
used as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature pattern 
to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD-AD discriminant feature 
pattern as input for the most performant ML algorithm to predict the disease 
prevalence in 15 dementia patients with a "mixed VD-AD dementia" (MXD) clinical 
profile using their baseline MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the 
diagnosis evidence from a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most 
efficient algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification 
accuracy greater than 84% using a small feature pattern. Moreover, ANFIS showed 
improved classification accuracy when trained with a multimodal input feature 
data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather than a unimodal feature data set. 
When applying the best discriminant pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a 
correct prediction rate of 77.33%. Overall, results showed that our approach has 
a high discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same 
approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent underlying 
disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is uncertain between AD and 
VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in supporting physicians' diagnostic 
evaluations.

OBJECTIVE: Gait impairment is common in patients with cerebral small vessel 
disease (SVD). However, gait studies in elderly SVD patients might be confounded 
by age-related comorbidities, such as polyneuropathy or sarcopenia. We therefore 
studied young patients with the genetically defined SVD CADASIL. Our aim was to 
examine the effects of pure SVD on single and dual task gait, and to investigate 
associations of gait performance with cognitive deficits and white matter 
alterations.
METHODS: We investigated single task walking and calculatory, semantic, or 
motoric dual task costs in 39 CADASIL patients (mean age 50 ± 8) using a 
computerized walkway. We obtained 3.0T MRI and neuropsychological data on 
processing speed, the main cognitive deficit in CADASIL. Spatiotemporal gait 
parameters were standardized based on data from 192 healthy controls. 
Associations between white matter integrity, assessed by diffusion tensor 
imaging, and gait were analyzed using both a global marker and voxel-wise 
analysis.
RESULTS: Compared to controls, CADASIL patients showed only mild single task 
gait impairment, and only in the rhythm domain. The semantic dual task 
additionally uncovered mild deficits in the pace domain. Processing speed was 
not associated with gait. White matter alterations were related to single task 
stride length but not to dual task performance.
INTERPRETATION: Despite severe disease burden, gait performance in patients with 
pure small vessel disease was relatively preserved in single and dual tasks. 
Results suggest that age-related pathologies other than small vessel disease 
might play a role for gait impairment in elderly SVD patients.

Spatial-Temporal Dependency Modeling and Network Hub Detection for Functional 
MRI Analysis via Convolutional-Recurrent Network.

Wang M, Lian C, Yao D, Zhang D, Liu M, Shen D.

Early identification of dementia at the stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
is crucial for timely diagnosis and intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis 
based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their 
performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal 
dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit 
detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that 
are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique 
Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated 
prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. 
Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related 
hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first 
partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A 
sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the 
local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based 
on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their 
unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long 
short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain 
temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus 
capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 
174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our 
method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub 
detection.

Deep neural networks have led to state-of-the-art results in many medical 
imaging tasks including Alzheimer's disease (AD) detection based on structural 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, the network decisions are often 
perceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these 
algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise 
relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions 
for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces 
a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of each voxel 
contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to susceptibility 
maps produced by guided backpropagation ("Which change in voxels would change 
the outcome most?"), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive 
contributions to the network classification in the input space. In particular, 
we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals ("Why does this 
person have AD?") with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little 
relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of 
relevance correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the 
latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per brain 
area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although these metrics produce 
very individual "fingerprints" of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of 
importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus. After 
discussing several limitations such as sensitivity toward the underlying model 
and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP might have a high potential to 
assist clinicians in explaining neural network decisions for diagnosing AD (and 
potentially other diseases) based on structural MRI data.

Whole brain segmentation from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a 
prerequisite for most morphological analyses, but is computationally intense and 
can therefore delay the availability of image markers after scan acquisition. We 
introduce QuickNAT, a fully convolutional, densely connected neural network that 
segments a MRI brain scan in 20 s. To enable training of the complex network 
with millions of learnable parameters using limited annotated data, we propose 
to first pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation 
software. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on manual labels to 
rectify errors in auxiliary labels. With this learning strategy, we are able to 
use large neuroimaging repositories without manual annotations for training. In 
an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, 
pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves 
superior segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art 
methods, while being orders of magnitude faster. The speed up facilitates 
processing of large data repositories and supports translation of imaging 
biomarkers by making them available within seconds for fast clinical decision 
making.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate plasma neuronally derived 
extracellular vesicle (NDEV) levels of core pathological markers [amyloid-β (Aβ) 
and phosphorylated tau] and inflammatory biomarkers, including interleukin 6 
(IL-6) and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) in patients with Alzheimer's 
disease (AD).
METHODS: Thirty-one patients with AD and 15 cognitively normal controls (NCs) 
were recruited. The diagnosis of AD was supported by fluorodeoxyglucose and 
Pittsburgh Compound-B PET scans. Plasma extracellular vesicles were extracted, 
precipitated, and enriched for neuronal source by anti-L1CAM antibody 
absorption. Levels of Aβ42, P-T181-tau, P-S396-tau, IL-6, and MMP-9 in plasma 
NDEVs were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
RESULTS: Aβ42, P-T181-tau, and MMP-9 levels in plasma NDEVs were significantly 
higher in patients with AD than NCs. However, P-S396-tau and IL-6 levels in 
plasma NDEVs did not differ between AD patients and NCs. Moreover, there was no 
correlation between any of these biomarker levels and cognitive function as 
measured with Mini-Mental State Examination in patients with AD.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide further support that levels of core 
pathological markers, including Aβ42 and P-T181-tau, are elevated in plasma 
NDEVs of patients with AD. Furthermore, MMP-9 might play an important role in 
the pathogenesis of AD, and is a promising inflammatory biomarker for AD.

Neural network dysfunction may contribute to functional decline and disease 
progression in neurodegenerative disorders. Diverse lines of evidence suggest 
that neuronal accumulation of tau promotes network dysfunction and cognitive 
decline. The A152T-variant of human tau (hTau-A152T) increases the risk of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several other tauopathies. When overexpressed in 
neurons of transgenic mice, it causes age-dependent neuronal loss and cognitive 
decline, as well as non-convulsive epileptic activity, which is also seen in 
patients with AD. Using intracranial EEG recordings with electrodes implanted 
over the parietal cortex, we demonstrate that hTau-A152T increases the power of 
brain oscillations in the 0.5-6 Hz range more than wildtype human tau in 
transgenic lines with comparable levels of human tau protein in brain, and that 
genetic ablation of endogenous tau in Mapt-/- mice decreases the power of these 
oscillations as compared to wildtype controls. Suppression of hTau-A152T 
production in doxycycline-regulatable transgenic mice reversed their abnormal 
network activity. Treatment of hTau-A152T mice with the antiepileptic drug 
levetiracetam also rapidly and persistently reversed their brain dysrhythmia and 
network hypersynchrony. These findings suggest that both the level and the 
sequence of tau modulate the power of specific brain oscillations. The potential 
of EEG spectral changes as a biomarker deserves to be explored in clinical 
trials of tau-lowering therapeutics. Our results also suggest that levetiracetam 
treatment is able to counteract tau-dependent neural network dysfunction. Tau 
reduction and levetiracetam treatment may be of benefit in AD and other 
conditions associated with brain dysrhythmias and network hypersynchrony.

Study of Tissue Variation and Analysis of MR Brain Images using Optimized 
Multilevel Threshold and Deep CNN Features in Neurodegenerative Disorders.

Priyanka NA, Kavitha G.

Dementia is a degenerative irreversible disorder that globally causes a high 
socio-economic burden. The pathology progression of mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and Alzheimer diseases (AD) are correlated with each other. There is a 
need to examine the pathology variation to discriminate the disorder to provide 
appropriate treatment strategies. This study investigates about the brain tissue 
variations to identify the subtle change in progression. The considered normal, 
MCI and AD magnetic resonance (MR) images are obtained from Alzheimer's disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). In this work, multilevel Tsallis based grey wolf 
optimization (GWO) is used to segment the brain tissues. Then the feature is 
extracted from segmented white matter (WM), grey matter (GM) and cerebro spinal 
fluid (CSF) using convolution neural network (CNN). The obtained deep features 
are given to principal component analysis (PCA) to obtain a prominent feature 
set for normal, MCI and AD. Further the tissue variation of optimized deep 
features is analyzed using support vector machine (SVM). The results shows that 
Tsallis based GWO perform reliable tissue segmentation for normal, MCI and AD. 
The deep features are able to observe discrimination than the fully considered 
feature set. Finally, the classifier result shows distinct tissue variation 
among normal, MCI and AD subjects. Further the prominent features give a 
classification accuracy of 77%, 80.22% and 78.7% for WM, GM and CSF 
respectively. This concludes that GM variation is a close biological substrate 
of dementia progressive condition than the effects of time or aging. Thus, the 
proposed framework can be used as an effective system for diagnosis of 
progression in neurodegenerative disorders.

In recent times, accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays 
a vital role in patient care and further treatment. Predicting AD from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitive normal (CN) has become popular. 
Neuroimaging and computer-aided diagnosis techniques are used for classification 
of AD by physicians in the early stage. Most of the previous machine learning 
techniques work on handpicked features. In the recent days, deep learning has 
been applied for many medical image applications. Existing deep learning systems 
work on raw magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images and cortical surface as an 
input to the convolution neural network (CNN) to perform classification of AD. 
AD affects the brain volume and changes the gray matter texture. In our work, we 
used 1820 T2-weighted brain magnetic resonance volumes including 635 AD MRIs, 
548 MCI MRIs, and 637 CN MRIs, sliced into 18,017 voxels. We proposed an 
approach to extract the gray matter from brain voxels and perform the 
classification using the CNN. A Gaussian filter is used to enhance the voxels, 
and skull stripping algorithm is used to remove the irrelevant tissues from 
enhanced voxels. Then, those voxels are segmented by hybrid enhanced independent 
component analysis. Segmented gray matter is used as an input to the CNN. We 
performed clinical valuation using our proposed approach and achieved 90.47% 
accuracy, 86.66% of recall, and 92.59% precision.

A long-standing question is how to best use brain morphometric and genetic data 
to distinguish Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from cognitively normal (CN) 
subjects and to predict those who will progress from mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) to AD. Here, we use a neural network (NN) framework on both magnetic 
resonance imaging-derived quantitative structural brain measures and genetic 
data to address this question. We tested the effectiveness of NN models in 
classifying and predicting AD. We further performed a novel analysis of the NN 
model to gain insight into the most predictive imaging and genetics features and 
to identify possible interactions between features that affect AD risk. Data 
were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort and included baseline 
structural MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 138 AD 
patients, 225 CN subjects, and 358 MCI patients. We found that NN models with 
both brain and SNP features as predictors perform significantly better than 
models with either alone in classifying AD and CN subjects, with an area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992, and in predicting 
the progression from MCI to AD (AUC=0.835). The most important predictors in the 
NN model were the left middle temporal gyrus volume, the left hippocampus 
volume, the right entorhinal cortex volume, and the APOE (a gene that encodes 
apolipoprotein E) ɛ4 risk allele. Furthermore, we identified interactions 
between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right lateral occipital gyrus, 
the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and the left posterior 
cingulate, and SNP rs10838725 and the left lateral occipital gyrus. Our work 
shows the ability of NN models to not only classify and predict AD occurrence 
but also to identify important AD risk factors and interactions among them.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Neurovascular coupling is the complex biological 
process that underlies use-dependent increases in blood flow in response to 
neural activation. Neurovascular coupling was investigated at the early stage of 
CADASIL, a genetic paradigm of ischemic small vessel disease.
METHODS: Functional hyperemia and evoked potentials during 20- and 40-sec visual 
and motor stimulations were monitored simultaneously using arterial spin 
labeling-functional magnetic resonance imaging (ASL-fMRI) and 
electroencephalography.
RESULTS: Cortical functional hyperemia differed significantly between 19 
patients and 19 healthy individuals, whereas evoked potentials were unaltered. 
Functional hyperemia dynamics, assessed using the difference in the slope of the 
response curve between 15 and 30 sec, showed a time-shifted decrease in the 
response to 40-sec neural stimulations in CADASIL patients. These results were 
replicated in a second cohort of 10 patients and 10 controls and confirmed in 
the whole population.
INTERPRETATION: Alterations of neurovascular coupling occur early in CADASIL and 
can be assessed by ASL-fMRI using a simple marker of vascular dysfunction.

Identifying heterogeneous cognitive impairment markers at an early stage is 
vital for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, due to complex and uncertain 
brain connectivity features in the cognitive domains, it remains challenging to 
quantify functional brain connectomic changes during non-pharmacological 
interventions for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. We present 
a quantitative method for functional brain network analysis of fMRI data based 
on the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G). This neural 
network-based model can effectively learn low-dimensional Gaussian distributions 
from the original high-dimensional sparse functional brain networks, quantify 
uncertainties in link prediction, and discover the intrinsic dimensionality of 
brain networks. Using the Wasserstein distance to measure probabilistic changes, 
we discovered that brain regions in the default mode network and 
somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, 
and visual and dorsal attention systems had relatively large variations during 
non-pharmacological training, which might provide distinct biomarkers for 
fine-grained monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration. An important finding of 
our study is the ability of the new method to capture subtle changes for 
individual patients before and after short-term intervention. More broadly, the 
MG2G method can be used in studying multiple brain disorders and injuries, e.g., 
in Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI), and hence it will be 
useful to the wider neuroscience community.

Machine learning and pattern recognition have been widely investigated in order 
to look for the biomarkers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, most existing 
methods extract features by seed-based correlation, which not only requires 
prior information but also ignores the relationship between resting state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) voxels. In this study, we 
proposed a deep learning classification framework with multivariate data-driven 
based feature extraction for automatic diagnosis of AD. Specifically, a 
three-level hierarchical partner matching independent components analysis 
(3LHPM-ICA) approach was proposed first in order to address the issues in 
spatial individual ICA, including the uncertainty of the numbers of components, 
the randomness of initial values, and the correspondence of ICs of multiple 
subjects, resulting in stable and reliable ICs which were applied as the 
intrinsic brain functional connectivity (FC) features. Second, Granger causality 
(GC) was utilized to infer directional interaction between the ICs that were 
identified by the 3LHPM-ICA method and extract the effective connectivity 
features. Finally, a deep learning classification framework was developed to 
distinguish AD from controls by fusing the functional and effective 
connectivities. A resting state fMRI dataset containing 34 AD patients and 34 
normal controls (NCs) was applied to the multivariate deep learning platform, 
leading to a classification accuracy of 95.59%, with a sensitivity of 97.06% and 
a specificity of 94.12% with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). The 
experimental results demonstrated that the measures of neural connectivities of 
ICA and GC followed by deep learning classification represented the most 
powerful methods of distinguishing AD clinical data from NCs, and these aberrant 
brain connectivities might serve as robust brain biomarkers for AD. This 
approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to classify other 
psychiatric disorders.

As calls for transparency in human subjects research grow, investigators 
conducting Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker research are increasingly required 
to consider their ethical obligations regarding the return of AD biomarker test 
results to research participants. When disclosing these test results to 
potentially vulnerable participants, investigators may face unique challenges to 
identify adverse events, particularly psychological events. The purpose of this 
paper is to describe our research team's experience with developing and 
implementing a process for enhanced adverse event monitoring following the 
return of amyloid-β (Aβ) imaging results to research participants with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Ethical and logistical considerations are presented 
along with preliminary findings from an ongoing randomized controlled trial of 
Aβ imaging results disclosure in MCI. Following receipt of amyloid imaging 
results, participants underwent 14 days of adverse event monitoring using 
ecological momentary assessment (EMA), a strategy to capture health, behaviors, 
and mood as they occur in participants' natural settings in real time. EMA 
telephone calls were placed at random during waking hours to screen for mood 
changes. Investigators were alerted for positive depression, anxiety, suicidal 
ideation screenings, or for two days of failed call attempts. Preliminary 
feasibility of twenty-four participants with MCI who participated in EMA mood 
assessments was successfully completed 83% (SD = 0.4) of the time over 14 days 
with no alerts for anxiety or depression screening items. EMA, when used with 
standard adverse event monitoring, is a promising and novel approach to maximize 
early detection of negative psychological reactions following AD biomarker 
results disclosed in research settings.

In this work, we propose a natural model for information flow in the brain 
through a neural message-passing dynamics on a structural network of macroscopic 
regions, such as the human connectome (HC). In our model, each brain region is 
assumed to have a binary behavior (active or not), the strengths of interactions 
among them are encoded in the anatomical connectivity matrix defined by the HC, 
and the dynamics of the system is defined by the Belief Propagation (BP) 
algorithm, working near the critical point of the network. We show that in the 
absence of direct external stimuli the BP algorithm converges to a spatial map 
of activations that is similar to the Default Mode Network (DMN) of the brain, 
which has been defined from the analysis of functional MRI data. Moreover, we 
use Susceptibility Propagation (SP) to compute the matrix of long-range 
correlations between the different regions and show that the modules defined by 
a clustering of this matrix resemble several Resting State Networks (RSN) 
determined experimentally. Both results suggest that the functional DMN and RSNs 
can be seen as simple consequences of the anatomical structure of the brain and 
a neural message-passing dynamics between macroscopic regions. With the new 
model, we explore predictions on how functional maps change when the anatomical 
brain network suffers structural alterations, like in Alzheimer's disease and in 
lesions of the Corpus Callosum. The implications and novel interpretations 
suggested by the model, as well as the role of criticality, are discussed.

Age at symptom onset (AAO) underlies different Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical 
variants: late-onset AD (LOAD) is characterized by memory deficits, while 
early-onset AD (EOAD) presents predominantly with non-memory symptoms. The 
involvement of different neural networks may explain these distinct clinical 
phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis of an early and selective 
involvement of neural networks based on AAO in AD. Twenty memory clinic patients 
with prodromal AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment with an AD-like cerebrospinal 
fluid profile) and 30 healthy controls underwent a cognitive evaluation and a 
resting state functional MRI exam. Independent component analysis was performed 
to assess functional connectivity (FC) in the following networks: default mode, 
frontoparietal, limbic, visual, and sensorimotor. Patients were stratified into 
late-onset (pLOAD) and early-onset (pEOAD) prodromal AD according to the AAO and 
controls were stratified into younger and older groups accordingly. Decreased FC 
within the default mode and the limbic networks was observed in pLOAD, while 
pEOAD showed lower FC in the frontoparietal and visual networks. The 
sensorimotor network did not show differences between groups. A significant 
association was found between memory and limbic network FC in pLOAD, and between 
executive functions and frontoparietal network FC in pEOAD, although the latter 
association did not survive multiple comparison correction. Our findings 
indicate that aberrant connectivity in memory networks is associated with pLOAD, 
while networks underlying executive and visuo-spatial functions are affected in 
pEOAD. These findings are in line with the hypothesis that the 
pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EOAD and LOAD are distinct.

Different modalities such as structural MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF have complementary 
information, which is likely to be very useful for diagnosis of AD and MCI. 
Therefore, it is possible to develop a more effective and accurate AD/MCI 
automatic diagnosis method by integrating complementary information of different 
modalities. In this paper, we propose multi-modal sparse hierarchical extreme 
leaning machine (MSH-ELM). We used volume and mean intensity extracted from 93 
regions of interest (ROIs) as features of MRI and FDG-PET, respectively, and 
used p-tau, t-tau, and Aβ42 as CSF features. In detail, high-level 
representation was individually extracted from each of MRI, FDG-PET, and CSF 
using a stacked sparse extreme learning machine auto-encoder (sELM-AE). Then, 
another stacked sELM-AE was devised to acquire a joint hierarchical feature 
representation by fusing the high-level representations obtained from each 
modality. Finally, we classified joint hierarchical feature representation using 
a kernel-based extreme learning machine (KELM). The results of MSH-ELM were 
compared with those of conventional ELM, single kernel support vector machine 
(SK-SVM), multiple kernel support vector machine (MK-SVM) and stacked 
auto-encoder (SAE). Performance was evaluated through 10-fold cross-validation. 
In the classification of AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC problem, the proposed MSH-ELM 
method showed mean balanced accuracies of 96.10% and 86.46%, respectively, which 
is much better than those of competing methods. In summary, the proposed 
algorithm exhibits consistently better performance than SK-SVM, ELM, MK-SVM and 
SAE in the two binary classification problems (AD vs. HC and MCI vs. HC).

Using structure-guided design, several cell based assays, and microdosed 
positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we identified a series of highly 
potent, selective, and brain-penetrant oxazole-4-carboxamide-based inhibitors of 
glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). An isotopologue of our first-generation 
lead, [3H]PF-367, demonstrates selective and specific target engagement in 
vitro, irrespective of the activation state. We discovered substantial 
ubiquitous GSK-3-specific radioligand binding in Tg2576 Alzheimer's disease 
(AD), suggesting application for these compounds in AD diagnosis and identified 
[11C]OCM-44 as our lead GSK-3 radiotracer, with optimized brain uptake by PET 
imaging in nonhuman primates. GSK-3β-isozyme selectivity was assessed to reveal 
OCM-51, the most potent (IC50 = 0.030 nM) and selective (>10-fold GSK-3β/GSK-3α) 
GSK-3β inhibitor known to date. Inhibition of CRMP2T514 and tau phosphorylation, 
as well as favorable therapeutic window against WNT/β-catenin signaling 
activation, was observed in cells.

Development of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging agents capable of 
quantifying tau aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) is of enormous importance in the field of dementia research. The 
aim of the present study was to conduct first-in-man imaging studies with the 
potential novel tau imaging agent [18F]N-methyl lansoprazole ([18F]NML). Herein 
we report validation of the synthesis of [18F]NML for clinical use by labeling 
the trifluoromethyl group via radiofluorination of the corresponding 
gem-difluoro enol ether precursor. This is the first use of this method for 
clinical production of PET radiotracers and confirmed that it can be readily 
implemented at multiple production facilities to provide [18F]NML in good 
noncorrected radiochemical yield (3.4 ± 1.5 GBq, 4.6% ± 2.6%) and molar activity 
(120.1 ± 186.3 GBq/μmol), excellent radiochemical purity (>97%), and suitable 
for human use (n = 15). With [18F]NML in hand, we conducted rodent 
biodistribution, estimates of human dosimetry, and preliminary evaluation of 
[18F]NML in human subjects at two imaging sites. Healthy controls (n = 4) and 
mildly cognitively impaired (MCI) AD patients (n = 6) received [18F]NML (tau), 
[18F]AV1451 (tau), and [18F]florbetaben or [18F]florbetapir (amyloid) PET scans. 
A single progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) patient also received [18F]NML and 
[18F]AV1451 PET scans. [18F]NML showed good brain uptake, reasonable 
pharmacokinetics, and appropriate imaging characteristics in healthy controls. 
The mean ± SD of the administered mass of [18F/19F]NML was 2.01 ± 2.17 μg 
(range, 0.16-8.27 μg) and the mean administered activity was 350 ± 62 MBq 
(range, 199-403 MBq). There were no adverse or clinically detectable 
pharmacologic effects in any of the 11 subjects, and no significant changes in 
vital signs were observed. However, despite high affinity for tau in vitro, 
brain retention in MCI/AD and PSP patients was low, and there was no evidence of 
specific signals in vivo that corresponded to tau. Although it is still unclear 
why clinical translation of the radiotracer was unsuccessful, we nevertheless 
conclude that further development of [18F]NML as a tau PET imaging agent is not 
warranted at this time.

Medical practice is ideally based on robust, relevant research. However, the 
lack of disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's disease has motivated 
"innovative practice" to improve patients' well-being despite insufficient 
evidence for the regular use of such interventions in health systems treating 
millions of patients. Innovative or new non-validated practice poses at least 
three distinct ethical questions: first, about the responsible application of 
new non-validated practice to individual patients (clinical ethics); second, 
about the way in which data from new non-validated practice are communicated via 
the scientific and lay press (scientific communication ethics); and third, about 
the prospect of making new non-validated interventions widely available before 
more definitive testing (public health ethics). We argue that the authors of 
metabolic enhancement protocols for Alzheimer's disease have overstated the 
evidence in favor of these interventions within the scientific and lay press, 
failing to communicate weaknesses in their data and uncertainty about their 
conclusions. Such unmeasured language may create false hope, cause financial 
harm, undermine informed consent, and frustrate the production of generalizable 
knowledge necessary to face the societal problems posed by this devastating 
disease. We therefore offer more stringent guidelines for responsible innovation 
in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.

Amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques aggregation is considered as the "start" of the 
degenerative process that manifests years before the clinical symptoms appear in 
Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The aim of this study is to use back propagation 
neural networks (BPNNs) in 18F-florbetapir PET data for automated classification 
of four patient groups including AD, late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), 
early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), and significant memory concern (SMC), 
versus normal control (NC) for early AD detection. Five hundred images for AD, 
LMCI, EMCI, SMC, and NC, i.e., 100 images for each group, were used from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The results showed 
that the automated classification of NC/AD produced a high accuracy of 87.9%, 
while the results for the prodromal stages of the disease were 66.4%, 60.0%, and 
52.9% for NC/LCMI, NC/EMCI and NC/SMC, respectively. The proposed method 
together with the image preparation steps can be used for early AD detection and 
classification with high accuracy using Aβ PET dataset.

Functional connectivity networks (FCNs) based on functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI) have been widely applied to analyzing and diagnosing brain 
diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodrome stage, i.e., mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing studies usually use Pearson correlation 
coefficient (PCC) method to construct FCNs, and then extract network measures 
(e.g., clustering coefficients) as features to learn a diagnostic model. 
However, the valuable observation information in network construction (e.g., 
specific contributions of different time points), as well as high-level and 
high-order network features are neglected in these studies. In this paper, we 
first define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure 
the correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are learned in a 
data-driven manner to characterize the contributions of different time points, 
thus conveying the richer interaction information among brain regions compared 
with the PCC method. Furthermore, we build a wc-kernel based convolutional 
neural network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for learning the hierarchical 
(i.e., from local to global and also from low-level to high-level) features for 
disease diagnosis, by using fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to 
build dynamic FCNs using our proposed wc-kernels. Then, we define another three 
layers to sequentially extract local (brain region specific), global (brain 
network specific) and temporal features from the constructed dynamic FCNs for 
classification. Experimental results on 174 subjects (a total of 563 scans) with 
rest-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data from ADNI database demonstrate the efficacy of 
our proposed method.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative illnesses 
(dementia) among the elderly. Recently, researchers have developed a new method 
for the instinctive analysis of AD based on machine learning and its subfield, 
deep learning. Recent state-of-the-art techniques consider multimodal diagnosis, 
which has been shown to achieve high accuracy compared to a unimodal prognosis. 
Furthermore, many studies have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
to measure brain volumes and the volume of subregions, as well as to search for 
diffuse changes in white/gray matter in the brain. In this study, T1-weighted 
structural MRI was used for the early classification of AD. MRI results in 
high-intensity visible features, making preprocessing and segmentation easy. To 
use this image modality, we acquired four types of datasets from each dataset's 
server. In this work, we downloaded 326 subjects from the National Research 
Center for Dementia homepage, 123 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage, 121 subjects from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Repository Without Borders homepage, and 131 subjects from the National 
Alzheimer's Coordinating Center homepage. In our experiment, we used the 
multiatlas label propagation with expectation-maximization-based refinement 
segmentation method. We segmented the images into 138 anatomical morphometry 
images (in which 40 features belonged to subcortical volumes and the remaining 
98 features belonged to cortical thickness). The entire dataset was split into a 
70 : 30 (training and testing) ratio before classifying the data. A principal 
component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction. Then, the support 
vector machine radial basis function classifier was used for classification 
between two groups-AD versus health control (HC) and early mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) (EMCI) versus late MCI (LMCI). The proposed method performed 
very well for all four types of dataset. For instance, for the AD versus HC 
group, the classifier achieved an area under curve (AUC) of more than 89% for 
each dataset. For the EMCI versus LMCI group, the classifier achieved an AUC of 
more than 80% for every dataset. Moreover, we also calculated Cohen kappa and 
Jaccard index statistical values for all datasets to evaluate the classification 
reliability. Finally, we compared our results with those of recently published 
state-of-the-art methods.

Neuropathological studies showed early locus coeruleus (LC) neuronal loss 
associated with tauopathy in Alzheimer's Disease (AD). We used the LC signal 
intensity (LC-I) on 3T MRI to assess the LC integrity in AD (n = 37) and 
controls (n = 17). The LC-I was decreased in AD regardless of typical (amnesic) 
and atypical presentation (logopenic aphasia/visuo-spatial deficit), from the 
prodromal stage, and independently of the amyloid load measured by PiB-PET. The 
LC-I was correlated with memory performance of typical AD. This supports the 
pathophysiological model in which the LC plays a critical role in AD and may 
thus be a potential therapeutic target.

Despite much attention to the use of biomarkers for predicting Alzheimer 
disease, little information is available at the individual level. We used the 
population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging to estimate absolute risk of 
cognitive impairment by biomarker group. Risk increased with age and any 
biomarker abnormality. For example, a 75-year-old with abnormal amyloid and 
cortical thinning biomarkers has about a 20% chance of cognitive impairment by 
age 80 years, whereas with normal biomarkers the chance is <10%. Persons with 
only one abnormal biomarker had similar intermediate risks. ANN NEUROL

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have demonstrated that the 
brain undergoes age-related neuroanatomical changes not only regionally but also 
on the network level during the normal development and aging process. In recent 
years, many studies have focused on estimating age using structural MRI 
measurements. However, the age prediction effects on different structural 
networks remain unclear. In this study, we established age prediction models 
based on common structural networks using convolutional neural networks (CNN) 
with data from 1,454 healthy subjects aged 18-90 years. First, based on the 
reference map of CorticalParcellation_Yeo2011, we obtained structural network 
images for each subject, including images of the following: the frontoparietal 
network (FPN), the dorsal attention network (DAN), the default mode network 
(DMN), the somatomotor network (SMN), the ventral attention network (VAN), the 
visual network (VN), and the limbic network (LN). Then, we built a 3D CNN model 
for each structural network using a large training dataset (n = 1,303) and the 
predicted ages of the subjects in the test dataset (n = 151). Finally, we 
estimated the age prediction performance of CNN compared with Gaussian process 
regression (GPR) and relevance vector regression (RVR). The results of CNN 
showed that the FPN, DAN, and DMN exhibited the optimal age prediction 
accuracies with mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 5.55 years, 5.77 years, and 6.07 
years, respectively, and the other four networks, i.e., the SMN, VAN, VN, and 
LN, tended to have larger MAEs of more than 8 years. With respect to GPR and 
RVR, the top three prediction accuracies were still from the FPN, DAN, and DMN; 
moreover, CNN made more precise predictions than GPR and RVR for these three 
networks. Our findings suggested that CNN has the optimal age prediction 
performance, and our age prediction model can be potentially used for brain 
disorder diagnosis according to age prediction differences.

Methods: Alzheimer's disease and Frontotemporal dementia are the first and third 
most common forms of dementia. Due to their similar clinical symptoms, they are 
easily misdiagnosed as each other even with sophisticated clinical guidelines. 
For disease-specific intervention and treatment, it is essential to develop a 
computer-aided system to improve the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. 
Recent advances in deep learning have delivered some of the best performance for 
medical image recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential 
diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored. Approach: In this 
study, we proposed a novel deep learning based framework to distinguish between 
brain images of normal aging individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. 
Specifically, we combined the multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features 
with Generative Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the 
differential diagnosis accuracy. Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, 
and data augmentation methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis 
for both AD and FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large 
sample of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall 
accuracy of 88.28%. Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are 
three-fold: (1) our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple 
structural features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural 
network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we show that 
the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data augmentation could further 
improve the discriminant ability of the network regarding challenging tasks such 
as differentiating dementia sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble 
classifier strategy could make the network more robust and stable.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether brain amyloid burden in elderly patients with 
narcolepsy type 1 (NT1) is lower than in controls, and to assess in patients 
with NT1 the relationships between amyloid burden, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) 
markers of Alzheimer disease (AD), CSF orexin-A, and cognitive profile.
METHODS: Cognitive and 18 F-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data 
were compared in patients with NT1 aged ≥ 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and 
sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention 
Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The 
standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions 
of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 
3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A 
cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio ≥ 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid.
RESULTS: Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI 
and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 ± 0.15, 
1.11 ± 0.18 [p < 0.0001], and 1.14 ± 0.17 [p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar 
results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all 
cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) 
had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the 
MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not 
associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile.
INTERPRETATION: Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by 18 F-florbetapir PET, in 
patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques. ANN NEUROL

PURPOSE: In subjects with amyloid deposition, striatal accumulation of 
11C-Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) demonstrated by positron emission tomography 
(PET) is related to the stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we 
investigated the correlation between striatal and cortical non-displaceable 
binding potential (BPND).
METHODS: Seventy-three subjects who complained of cognitive disturbance 
underwent dynamic PiB-PET studies and showed positive PiB accumulation were 
retrospectively selected. These subjects included 34 AD, 26 mild cognitive 
impairment, 2 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Parkinson's disease, 5 
dementia with Lewy bodies, and 4 undefined diagnosis patients. Individual BPND 
images were produced from the dynamic data of the PiB-PET study, and voxel-based 
analyses were performed to estimate the correlations between striatal and other 
regional cortical BPND measures.
RESULTS: There were highly significant correlations between striatal and 
prefrontal BPND, with the highest correlation being demonstrated in left 
Brodmann area 11. We found that almost all of the high cortical BPND values 
correlated with striatal BPND values, with the exception of the occipital cortex 
with low correlation.
CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated positive correlations in amyloid deposits 
between the striatum and other cortical areas with functional and anatomical 
links. The amyloid distribution in the brain is not random, but spreads 
following the functional and anatomical connections.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging a neuroimaging technique which is used in 
brain disorders and dysfunction studies, has been improved in recent years by 
mapping the topology of the brain connections, named connectopic mapping. Based 
on the fact that healthy and unhealthy brain regions and functions differ 
slightly, studying the complex topology of the functional and structural 
networks in the human brain is too complicated considering the growth of 
evaluation measures. One of the applications of irregular graph deep learning is 
to analyze the human cognitive functions related to the gene expression and 
related distributed spatial patterns. Since a variety of brain solutions can be 
dynamically held in the neuronal networks of the brain with different activity 
patterns and functional connectivity, both node-centric and graph-centric tasks 
are involved in this application. In this study, we used an individual 
generative model and high order graph analysis for the region of interest 
recognition areas of the brain with abnormal connection during performing 
certain tasks and resting-state or decompose irregular observations. 
Accordingly, a high order framework of Variational Graph Autoencoder with a 
Gaussian distributer was proposed in the paper to analyze the functional data in 
brain imaging studies in which Generative Adversarial Network is employed for 
optimizing the latent space in the process of learning strong non-rigid graphs 
among large scale data. Furthermore, the possible modes of correlations were 
distinguished in abnormal brain connections. Our goal was to find the degree of 
correlation between the affected regions and their simultaneous occurrence over 
time. We can take advantage of this to diagnose brain diseases or show the 
ability of the nervous system to modify brain topology at all angles and brain 
plasticity according to input stimuli. In this study, we particularly focused on 
Alzheimer's disease.

We introduce Bayesian QuickNAT for the automated quality control of whole-brain 
segmentation on MRI T1 scans. Next to the Bayesian fully convolutional neural 
network, we also present inherent measures of segmentation uncertainty that 
allow for quality control per brain structure. For estimating model uncertainty, 
we follow a Bayesian approach, wherein, Monte Carlo (MC) samples from the 
posterior distribution are generated by keeping the dropout layers active at 
test time. Entropy over the MC samples provides a voxel-wise model uncertainty 
map, whereas expectation over the MC predictions provides the final 
segmentation. Next to voxel-wise uncertainty, we introduce four metrics to 
quantify structure-wise uncertainty in segmentation for quality control. We 
report experiments on four out-of-sample datasets comprising of diverse age 
range, pathology and imaging artifacts. The proposed structure-wise uncertainty 
metrics are highly correlated with the Dice score estimated with manual 
annotation and therefore present an inherent measure of segmentation quality. In 
particular, the intersection over union over all the MC samples is a suitable 
proxy for the Dice score. In addition to quality control at scan-level, we 
propose to incorporate the structure-wise uncertainty as a measure of confidence 
to do reliable group analysis on large data repositories. We envisage that the 
introduced uncertainty metrics would help assess the fidelity of automated deep 
learning based segmentation methods for large-scale population studies, as they 
enable automated quality control and group analyses in processing large data 
repositories.

Community-dwelling African American elders are twice as likely to develop mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease and related dementias than 
older white Americans and therefore represent a significant at-risk group in 
need of early monitoring. More extensive imaging or cerebrospinal fluid studies 
represent significant barriers due to cost and burden. We combined functional 
connectivity and graph theoretical measures, derived from resting-state 
electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, with computerized cognitive testing to 
identify differences between persons with MCI and healthy controls based on a 
sample of community-dwelling African American elders. We found a significant 
decrease in functional connectivity and a less integrated graph topology in 
persons with MCI. A combination of functional connectivity, topological and 
cognition measurements is powerful for prediction of MCI and combined measures 
are clearly more effective for prediction than using a single approach. 
Specifically, by combining cognition features with functional connectivity and 
topological features the prediction improved compared with the classification 
using features from single cognitive or EEG domains, with an accuracy of 86.5%, 
compared with the accuracy of 77.5% of the best single approach. 
Community-dwelling African American elders find EEG and computerized testing 
acceptable and results are promising in terms of differentiating between healthy 
controls and persons with MCI living in the community.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies suggest that Alzheimer's disease (AD) biomarker 
disclosure has no discernable psychological impact on cognitively healthy 
persons. Far less is known about how such results affect symptomatic individuals 
and their caregivers.
METHODS: Randomized controlled trial of 82 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
patient and caregiver dyads (total n = 164) to determine the effect of receiving 
amyloid positron emission tomography results on understanding of, and perceived 
efficacy to cope with, MCI over 52 weeks of follow-up.
RESULTS: Gains in the primary outcomes were not consistently observed. Amyloid 
negative patients reported greater perceived ambiguity regarding MCI at 
follow-up, while moderate and sustained emotional distress was observed in 
patients, and to a lesser extent, caregivers, of those who were amyloid 
positive. There was no corresponding increase in depressive symptoms.
DISCUSSION: These findings point to the possibility that both MCI patients and 
caregivers may need emotional support after the disclosure of amyloid scan 
results.

T1-weighted MRI has been extensively used to extract imaging biomarkers and 
build classification models for differentiating Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
patients from healthy controls, but only recently have brain connectome networks 
derived from diffusion-weighted MRI been used to model AD progression and 
various stages of disease such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). MCI, as a 
possible prodromal stage of AD, has gained intense interest recently, since it 
may be used to assess risk factors for AD. Little work has been done to combine 
information from both white matter and gray matter, and it is unknown how much 
classification power the diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural connectome 
could provide beyond information available from T1-weighted MRI. In this paper, 
we focused on investigating whether diffusion-weighted MRI-derived structural 
connectome can improve differentiating healthy controls subjects from those with 
MCI. Specifically, we proposed a novel feature-ranking method to build 
classification models using the most highly ranked feature variables to classify 
MCI with healthy controls. We verified our method on two independent cohorts 
including the second stage of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
(ADNI2) database and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) 
database. Our results indicated that 1) diffusion-weighted MRI-derived 
structural connectome can complement T1-weighted MRI in the classification task; 
2) the feature-rank method is effective because of the identified consistent 
T1-weighted MRI and network feature variables on ADNI2 and NACC. Furthermore, by 
comparing the top-ranked feature variables from ADNI2, NACC, and combined 
dataset, we concluded that cross-validation using independent cohorts is 
necessary and highly recommended.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of 
electroencephalographic (EEG) volume conduction in different measures of 
functional connectivity and to characterize the EEG coupling alterations at the 
different stages of dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD).
APPROACH: Magnitude squared coherence (MSCOH), imaginary part of coherence 
(iCOH), lagged coherence (lagCOH), amplitude envelope correlation (AEC), 
synchronization likelihood (SL), phase lag index (PLI), phase locking value 
(PLV), and corrected imaginary PLV (ciPLV) were applied to: (i) synthetic 
signals generated with a Kuramoto-based model of several coupled oscillators; 
and (ii) a resting-state EEG database of real recordings from 51 cognitively 
healthy controls, 51 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, 51 mild AD (AD 
mil ) patients, 50 moderate AD (AD mod ) patients, and 50 severe AD (AD sev ) 
patients.
MAIN RESULTS: Our results using synthetic signals showed that PLI was the least 
affected parameter by spurious influences in a simulated volume conduction 
environment. Results using real EEG recordings showed that spontaneous activity 
of MCI patients is characterized by a significant coupling increase in the 
[Formula: see text] band. As dementia progresses, this increase in the [Formula: 
see text] band became more pronounced, and a significant widespread decrease in 
[Formula: see text] band appeared at the last stage of dementia.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results revealed that the estimation of functional EEG 
connectivity using PLI could reduce the bias introduced by the spurious 
influence of volume conduction, and it could increase the insight into the 
underlying brain dynamics at different stages of the AD continuum.

Kernel Granger Causality Based on Back Propagation Neural Network Fuzzy 
Inference System on fMRI Data.

Guo H, Zeng W, Shi Y, Deng J, Zhao L.

Granger causality (GC) is one of the most popular measures to investigate 
causality influence among brain regions and has been achieved significant 
results for exploring brain networks based on functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (fMRI). However, the predictors and order selection of conventional GC 
are based on linear models which result in such restrictions as poorly detection 
of nonlinearity and so on, in the application. This paper proposes a novel GC 
model called back propagation (BP) based kernel function Granger causality 
(BP_KFGC), in which symplectic geometry is used for embedding dimension and 
fuzzy inference system for predicting time series. The proposed method doesn't 
depend on the prediction of the vector auto-regression model, so that time 
series don't need to be wide-sense stationary as linear GC and kernel GC. In 
addition, it is a multivariate approach which is applicable to both linear and 
nonlinear systems and eliminates the effects of latent variables. The 
performance of the new method is evaluated and compared with linear GC, partial 
GC, neural network GC and kernel GC by simulated data with multiple adjustments 
to the nonlinearity. The results show that BP_KFGC outperforms the other four 
methods in detecting both linear and nonlinear causalities. Furthermore, we 
applied BP_KFGC to construct directed weight network (DWN) of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) patients and health controls (HCs), and then nine graph-based 
features of DWN were used for classification by the classifier of support vector 
machine with radial basis kernel function. The accuracy of 95.89%, sensitivity 
of 93.31%, and specificity of 94.97% were achieved which may provide an 
auxiliary mean for the clinical diagnosis of AD.

Purpose: Our study investigates whether a machine-learning-based system can 
predict the rate of cognitive decline in mildly cognitively impaired patients by 
processing only the clinical and imaging data collected at the initial visit. 
Approach: We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural 
network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform 
volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and integration of 
nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture. The 
experiments are conducted on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative 
dataset. Results: Experimental results confirm that there is a correlation 
between cognitive decline and the data obtained at the first visit. The system 
achieved an area under the receiver operator curve of 0.70 for cognitive decline 
class prediction. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first study that 
predicts "slowly deteriorating/stable" or "rapidly deteriorating" classes by 
processing routinely collected baseline clinical and demographic data [baseline 
MRI, baseline mini-mental state examination (MMSE), scalar volumetric data, age, 
gender, education, ethnicity, and race]. The training data are built based on 
MMSE-rate values. Unlike the studies in the literature that focus on predicting 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease conversion and disease 
classification, we approach the problem as an early prediction of cognitive 
decline rate in MCI patients.

BACKGROUND: Impairments in activities of daily living (ADL) are a criterion for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. However, ADL gradually decline in AD, 
impacting on advanced (a-ADL, complex interpersonal or social functioning), 
instrumental (IADL, maintaining life in community), and finally basic functions 
(BADL, activities related to physiological and self-maintenance needs). 
Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become an increasingly 
important aspect of daily functioning. Yet, the links of ADL, ICT, and 
neuropathology of AD dementia are poorly understood. Such knowledge is critical 
as it can provide biomarker evidence of functional decline in AD.
METHODS: ADL were evaluated with the Technology-Activities of Daily Living 
Questionnaire (T-ADLQ) in 33 patients with AD and 30 controls. ADL were divided 
in BADL, IADL, and a-ADL. The three domain subscores were covaried against gray 
matter atrophy via voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: Our results showed that three domain subscores of ADL correlate with 
several brain structures, with a varying degree of overlap between them. BADL 
score correlated mostly with frontal atrophy, IADL with more widespread frontal, 
temporal and occipital atrophy and a-ADL with occipital and temporal atrophy. 
Finally, ICT subscale was associated with atrophy in the precuneus.
CONCLUSIONS: The association between ADL domains and neurodegeneration in AD 
follows a traceable neuropathological pathway which involves different neural 
networks. This the first evidence of ADL phenotypes in AD characterised by 
specific patterns of functional decline and well-defined neuropathological 
changes. The identification of such phenotypes can yield functional biomarkers 
for dementias such as AD.

Detection of Early Stage Alzheimer's Disease using EEG Relative Power with Deep 
Neural Network.

Kim D, Kim K.

Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal based early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD), especially a discrimination between healthy control (HC) and mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) has received remarkable attentions to complement 
conventional diagnosing methods in clinical fields. A relative power (RP) metric 
which quantifies the abnormal EEG pattern 'slowing' has widely been used as a 
major feature to distinguish HC and MCI, however, the optimal spectral ranges of 
the RP are influenced by the given dataset. In this study, we proposed the deep 
neural network based classifier using the RP to fully exploit and recombine the 
features through its own learning structure. The DNN enhanced the diagnosis 
results compared to shallow neural network, and enabled to interpret the results 
as we used the wellknown RP features as the domain knowledge. We investigated 
and explored the potentials of DNN based detection of the earlystage AD.

BACKGROUND: Hippocampal atrophy is a supportive feature for the diagnosis of 
probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even for an expert neuroradiologist, 
tracing the hippocampus and measuring its volume is a time consuming and 
extremely challenging task. Accordingly, the development of reliable 
fully-automated segmentation algorithms is of paramount importance.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and the 
robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network (HUMAN) 
segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD diagnosis. For 
these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects and their T1 weighted 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The cohort included 145 controls 
(CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 94 AD patients from 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the 
baseline, repeat, 12 and 24 month follow-up scans were available.
RESULTS: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3% precision; volume 
measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) 
AUC1 = 0.08 ± 0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler effects 
present in MCI subjects, AUC2 = 0.76 ± 0.05. The algorithm is stable and 
reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans.
CONCLUSIONS: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise 
segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN, can 
effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become a useful 
tool for other neuroimaging applications.

Although alternations of brain functional networks (BFNs) derived from 
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been 
considered as promising biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, 
it is still challenging to perform individualized diagnosis, especially at the 
very early stage of preclinical stage of AD, i.e., early mild cognitive 
impairment (eMCI). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show powerful 
ability in computer vision and image analysis applications, but there is still a 
gap for directly applying CNNs to rs-fMRI-based disease diagnosis. In this 
paper, we propose a novel multiple-BFN-based 3D CNN framework that can 
automatically and deeply learn complex, high-level, hierarchical diagnostic 
features from various independent component analysis-derived BFNs. More 
importantly, the embedded features of different BFNs could comprehensively 
support each other towards a more accurate eMCI diagnosis in a unified model. 
The performance of the proposed method is validated by a large-sample, 
multisite, rigorously controlled publicly accessible dataset. The proposed 
framework can also be conveniently and straightforwardly applied to 
individualized diagnosis of various neurological and psychiatric diseases.

The discrimination of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal form 
(i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) from cognitively healthy control (HC) 
subjects is crucial since the treatment is more effective in the first stages of 
the dementia. The aim of our study is to evaluate the usefulness of a 
methodology based on electroencephalography (EEG) to detect AD and MCI. EEG 
rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects and 37 HC subjects. 
Artifact-free trials were analyzed by means of several spectral and nonlinear 
features: relative power in the conventional frequency bands, median frequency, 
individual alpha frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central 
tendency measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information. 
Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast 
correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The selected 
features were used to train three different models aimed at classifying the 
trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis 
(QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP). Afterwards, 
each subject was automatically allocated in a particular group by applying a 
trial-based majority vote procedure. After feature extraction, the FCBF method 
selected the optimal set of features: individual alpha frequency, relative power 
at delta frequency band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of 
features, MLP showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a 
subject is not healthy (sensitivity of 82.35% and positive predictive value of 
84.85% for HC vs. all classification task) and whether a subject does not suffer 
from AD (specificity of 79.41% and negative predictive value of 84.38% for AD 
vs. all comparison). Our findings suggest that our methodology can help 
physicians to discriminate AD, MCI and HC.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is an indispensable tool in the diagnosis of 
brain diseases due to painlessness and safety. Nevertheless, Rician noise is 
inevitably injected during the image acquisition process, which leads to poor 
observation and interferes with the treatment. Owing to the complexity of Rician 
noise, using the elimination method of Gaussian to remove it does not perform 
well. Therefore, the feature fusion and attention network (FFA-DMRI) is proposed 
to separate noise from observed MRI. Inspired by the attention-guided CNN 
network (ADNet) and Convolutional block attention module (CBAM), a spatial 
attention mechanism has been specially designed to obtain the area of interest 
in MRI. Furthermore, the feature fusion block concatenates local with global 
information, which makes full use of the multilevel structure and boosts the 
expressive ability of network. The comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's 
disease neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI) have demonstrated high 
effectiveness of FFA-DMRI with maintaining the crucial brain details. Moreover, 
in terms of visual inspections, the denoising results are also consistent with 
human perception.

Early Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Based on Resting-State Brain Networks and 
Deep Learning.

Ju R, Hu C, Zhou P, Li Q.

Computerized healthcare has undergone rapid development thanks to the advances 
in medical imaging and machine learning technologies. Especially, recent 
progress on deep learning opens a new era for multimedia based clinical decision 
support. In this paper, we use deep learning with brain network and clinical 
relevant text information to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). 
The clinical relevant text information includes age, gender, and ApoE gene of 
the subject. The brain network is constructed by computing the functional 
connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance 
imaging (R-fMRI) data. A targeted autoencoder network is built to distinguish 
normal aging from mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of AD. The proposed 
method reveals discriminative brain network features effectively and provides a 
reliable classifier for AD detection. Compared to traditional classifiers based 
on R-fMRI time series data, about 31.21 percent improvement of the prediction 
accuracy is achieved by the proposed deep learning method, and the standard 
deviation reduces by 51.23 percent in the best case that means our prediction 
model is more stable and reliable compared to the traditional methods. Our work 
excavates deep learning's advantages of classifying high-dimensional multimedia 
data in medical services, and could help predict and prevent AD at an early 
stage.

OBJECTIVE: To use a cluster analysis of [18 F]AV-1451 tau-PET data to determine 
how subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD) vary in the relative involvement of 
the entorhinal cortex and neocortex, and determine whether relative involvement 
of these two regions can help explain variability in age and clinical phenotype 
in AD.
METHODS: We calculated [18 F]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex 
in 62 amyloid-positive AD patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). 
tau-PET (positron emission tomography) values were normalized to the cerebellum 
to create standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). tau-PET SUVRs were 
log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups 
using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive 
performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters.
RESULTS: The cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and 
cortical uptake (ELo /CLo ), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake 
(ELo /CHi ), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (EHi /CHi ). 
Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly 
observed in the ELo /CLo and EHi /CHi clusters, and atypical AD most commonly 
observed in the ELo /CHi cluster. The ELo /CLo cluster had an older age at PET 
and onset than the other clusters. Apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the 
ELo /CHi cluster. The EHi /CHi cluster had the worst memory impairment, whereas 
the ELo /CHi cluster had the worst impairment in nonmemory domains.
INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates considerable variability in [18 
F]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straightforward clustering 
based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical 
presentation in AD. Ann Neurol 2018 Ann Neurol 2018;83:248-257.

Studies of clinical populations that combine MRI data generated at multiple 
sites are increasingly common. The Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in 
Depression (CAN-BIND; www.canbind.ca) is a national depression research program 
that includes multimodal neuroimaging collected at several sites across Canada. 
The purpose of the current paper is to provide detailed information on the 
imaging protocols used in a number of CAN-BIND studies. The CAN-BIND program 
implemented a series of platform-specific MRI protocols, including a suite of 
prescribed structural and functional MRI sequences supported by real-time 
monitoring for adherence and quality control. The imaging data are retained in 
an established informatics and databasing platform. Approximately 1300 
participants are being recruited, including almost 1000 with depression. These 
include participants treated with antidepressant medications, transcranial 
magnetic stimulation, cognitive behavioural therapy and cognitive remediation 
therapy. Our ability to analyze the large number of imaging variables available 
may be limited by the sample size of the substudies. The CAN-BIND program 
includes a multimodal imaging database supported by extensive clinical, 
demographic, neuropsychological and biological data from people with major 
depression. It is a resource for Canadian investigators who are interested in 
understanding whether aspects of neuroimaging — alone or in combination with 
other variables — can predict the outcomes of various treatment modalities.

Functional MRI (fMRI) is a prominent imaging technique to probe brain function, 
however, a substantial proportion of noise from multiple sources influences the 
reliability and reproducibility of fMRI data analysis and limits its clinical 
applications. Extensive effort has been devoted to improving fMRI data quality, 
but in the last two decades, there is no consensus reached which technique is 
more effective. In this study, we developed a novel deep neural network for 
denoising fMRI data, named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural 
network is 1) applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model 
noise; 2) spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in 
different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output 
denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on each 
subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. 
When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression methods for denoising 
fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, only 
DeNN had connectivity for functionally uncorrelated regions close to zero and 
successfully identified unbiased correlations between the posterior cingulate 
cortex seed and multiple brain regions within the default mode network or task 
positive network. The whole brain functional connectivity maps computed with 
DeNN-denoised data are approximately three times as homogeneous as the 
functional connectivity maps computed with raw data. Furthermore, the improved 
homogeneity strengthens rather than weakens the statistical power of fMRI in 
detecting intrinsic functional differences between cognitively normal subjects 
and subjects with Alzheimer's disease.

Space travel will expose people to high-energy, heavy particle radiation, and 
the cognitive deficits induced by this exposure are not well understood. To 
investigate the short-term effects of space radiation, we irradiated 4-month-old 
Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like transgenic (Tg) mice and wildtype (WT) littermates 
with a single, whole-body dose of 10 or 50 cGy 56Fe ions (1 GeV/u) at Brookhaven 
National Laboratory. At ~1.5 months post irradiation, behavioural testing showed 
sex-, genotype-, and dose-dependent changes in locomotor activity, contextual 
fear conditioning, grip strength, and motor learning, mainly in Tg but not WT 
mice. There was little change in general health, depression, or anxiety. Two 
months post irradiation, microPET imaging of the stable binding of a 
translocator protein ligand suggested no radiation-specific change in 
neuroinflammation, although initial uptake was reduced in female mice 
independently of cerebral blood flow. Biochemical and immunohistochemical 
analyses revealed that radiation reduced cerebral amyloid-β levels and microglia 
activation in female Tg mice, modestly increased microhemorrhages in 50 cGy 
irradiated male WT mice, and did not affect synaptic marker levels compared to 
sham controls. Taken together, we show specific short-term changes in 
neuropathology and behaviour induced by 56Fe irradiation, possibly having 
implications for long-term space travel.

INTRODUCTION: Mnemonic strategy training (MST) has been shown to improve 
cognitive performance and increase brain activation in those with mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI). However, little is known regarding the effects of MST on 
functional connectivity (FC) at rest. The aim of the present study was to 
investigate the MST focused on face-name associations effect on resting-state FC 
in those with MCI.
METHODS: Twenty-six amnestic MCI participants were randomized in MST (N = 14) 
and Education Program (active control; N = 12). Interventions occurred twice a 
week over two consecutive weeks (ie, four sessions). Resting-state functional 
magnetic resonance imaging was collected at pre- and post-intervention. Regions 
of interest (ROIs) were selected based on areas that previously showed 
task-related activation changes after MST. Changes were examined through 
ROI-to-ROI analysis and significant results were corrected for multiple 
comparisons.
RESULTS: At post-intervention, only the MST group showed increased FC, whereas 
the control group showed decreased or no change in FC. After MST, there was an 
increased FC between the left middle temporal gyrus and right orbitofrontal 
cortex. In addition, a time-by-group interaction indicated that the MST group 
showed greater increased FC between the right inferior frontal gyrus and left 
brain regions, such as fusiform gyrus, temporal pole, and orbitofrontal cortex 
relative to controls.
DISCUSSION: MST enhanced FC in regions that are functionally relevant for the 
training; however, not in all ROIs investigated. Our findings suggest that 
MST-induced changes are reflected in task-specific conditions, as previously 
reported, but also in general innate connectivity. Our results both enhance 
knowledge about the mechanisms underlying MST effects and may provide 
neurophysiological evidence of training transfer.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β and 
tau proteins, which are believed to lead to neural damage that translates into 
brain dysfunction and cognitive deficits. Brain dysfunction can be evaluated by 
measuring single-neuron activity (spikes), global neural activity (local field 
potentials, LFPs) and the interaction between them. Considering that the dynamic 
interactions between the hippocampal pyramidal cells and lateral septum are 
important for proper structure function, we used the complete septo-hippocampal 
preparation from 30-day-old controls and J20-AD transgenic mice to record 
changes in spiking activity from the lateral septum and its relationship with 
LFP activity from the CA1 area. The cross-correlation analysis revealed that 
young J20 transgenic mice exhibit a significant reduction in coupling between 
lateral septum single-cell activity and neural network activity from the 
hippocampal CA1. Consistently, phase-lock analysis between lateral septum 
single-cell activity and CA1 neural network activity showed lower values in J20 
transgenic mice. Similarly, the LFP- LFP coherence between CA1 and septum in the 
theta range showed lower values in J20 animals. Importantly, alterations were 
found before any detectable signs of cognitive deficits. Our data indicate that 
the disruption in the communication between hippocampus and rostral lateral 
septum is an early event in AD pathology and may contribute to the deficits 
observed during AD.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease where 
biomarkers for disease based on pathophysiology may be able to provide objective 
measures for disease diagnosis and staging. Neuroimaging scans acquired from MRI 
and metabolism images obtained by FDG-PET provide in-vivo measurements of 
structure and function (glucose metabolism) in a living brain. It is 
hypothesized that combining multiple different image modalities providing 
complementary information could help improve early diagnosis of AD. In this 
paper, we propose a novel deep-learning-based framework to discriminate 
individuals with AD utilizing a multimodal and multiscale deep neural network. 
Our method delivers 82.4% accuracy in identifying the individuals with mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) who will convert to AD at 3 years prior to conversion 
(86.4% combined accuracy for conversion within 1-3 years), a 94.23% sensitivity 
in classifying individuals with clinical diagnosis of probable AD, and a 86.3% 
specificity in classifying non-demented controls improving upon results in 
published literature.

Memory dysfunction is one of the main cognitive impairments caused by stroke, 
especially associative memory. Therefore, cognitive training, such as face-name 
mnemonic strategy training, could be an important intervention for this group of 
patients. The goal of this study was to evaluate the behavioral effects of 
face-name mnemonic strategy training, along with the neural substrate behind 
these effects, in the left frontoparietal lobe stroke patients. Volunteers 
underwent 2 sessions of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during 
face-name association task: one prior and the other after the cognitive 
training. The fMRI followed a block design task with three active conditions: 
trained face-name pairs, untrained face-name pairs, and a couple of repeated 
face-name pairs. Prior to each fMRI session, volunteers underwent 
neuropsychological assessment. Training resulted in better performance on 
delayed memory scores of HVLT-R, and on recognition on a generalization strategy 
task, as well as better performance in the fMRI task. Also, trained face-name 
pairs presented higher activation after training in default-mode network 
regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, and angular gyrus, 
as well as in lateral occipital and temporal regions. Similarly, untrained 
face-name pairs also showed a nonspecific training effect in the right superior 
parietal cortex, right supramarginal gyrus, anterior intraparietal sulcus, and 
lateral occipital cortex. A correlation between brain activation and task 
performance was also found in the angular gyrus, superior parietal cortex, 
anterior intraparietal sulcus, and lateral occipital cortex. In conclusion, 
these results suggest that face-name mnemonic strategy training has the 
potential to improve memory performance and to foster brain activation changes, 
by the recruitment of contralesional areas from default-mode, frontoparietal, 
and dorsal attention networks as a possible compensation mechanism.

Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is of particular concern for the aging community 
since there is both increased incidence of TBI and decreased functional recovery 
in this population. In addition, TBI is the strongest environmental risk factor 
for development of Alzheimer's disease and other dementia-related 
neurodegenerative disorders. Critical changes that affect cognition take place 
over time following the initial insult. Our previous work identified immune 
system activation as a key contributor to cognitive deficits observed in aged 
animals. Using a focal contusion model in the current study, we demonstrate a 
brain lesion and cavitation formation, as well as prolonged blood⁻brain barrier 
breakdown. These changes were associated with a prolonged inflammatory response, 
characterized by increased microglial cell number and phagocytic activity 30 
days post injury, corresponding to significant memory deficits. We next aimed to 
identify the injury-induced cellular and molecular changes that lead to chronic 
cognitive deficits in aged animals, and measured increases in complement 
initiation components C1q, C3, and CR3, which are known to regulate 
microglial⁻synapse interactions. Specifically, we found significant accumulation 
of C1q on synapses within the hippocampus, which was paralleled by synapse loss 
30 days post injury. We used genetic and pharmacological approaches to determine 
the mechanistic role of complement initiation on cognitive loss in aging animals 
after TBI. Notably, both genetic and pharmacological blockade of the complement 
pathway prevented memory deficits in aged injured animals. Thus, therapeutically 
targeting early components of the complement cascade represents a significant 
avenue for possible clinical intervention following TBI in the aging population.

Multimodal Neuroimaging Feature Learning With Multimodal Stacked Deep Polynomial 
Networks for Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease.

Shi J, Zheng X, Li Y, Zhang Q, Ying S.

The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., 
mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay 
of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its 
effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently 
proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and 
small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) 
algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and 
learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. 
Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of 
MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal 
neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI 
dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification 
tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the 
state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.

OBJECTIVE: We propose an innovative approach for 18F-FDG PET analysis based on 
an interval-valued reconstruction of 18F-FDG brain distribution. Its diagnostic 
performance for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis with comparison to a 
validated post-processing software was assessed.
METHODS: Brain 18F-FDG PET data from 26 subjects were acquired in a clinical 
routine setting. Raw data were reconstructed using an interval-valued version of 
the ML-EM algorithm called NIBEM that stands for Non-Additive interval-based 
expectation maximization. Subject classification was obtained via interval-based 
statistical comparison (intersection ratio, IR) between cortical regions of 
interest (ROI) including parietal, temporal, and temporo-mesial cortices and a 
reference region, the sub-cortical grey nuclei, known not to be affected by AD. 
In parallel, PET images were post-processed using a validated automated software 
based on the computation of ROI normalized uptake ratios standard deviation 
(SUVr SD) with reference to a healthy control database (Siemens Scenium). 
Clinical diagnosis made during follow-up was considered as the gold-standard for 
patient classification (16 healthy controls and 10 AD patients).
RESULTS: Both methods provided cortical ROI indices that were significantly 
different between controls and AD patients. The area under the ROC curve for 
control/AD classification was statistically identical (0.96 for NIBEM IR and 
0.95 for Scenium SUVr SD). At the optimal threshold, the sensitivity, 
specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value 
were, respectively, 100%, 88%, 92%, 83%, and 100% for both Scenium SUVr SD and 
NIBEM IR methods.
CONCLUSION: This preliminary study shows that interval-valued reconstruction 
allows self-consistent analysis of brain 18F-FDG PET data, yielding diagnostic 
performances that seem promising with respect to those of a commercial 
post-processing software based on SUVr SD analysis.

Structural MR images concomitantly acquired with PET images can provide crucial 
anatomic information for precise quantitative analysis. However, in the clinical 
setting, not all the subjects have corresponding MR images. Here, we developed a 
model to generate structural MR images from amyloid PET using deep generative 
networks. We applied our model to quantification of cortical amyloid load 
without structural MR. Methods: We used florbetapir PET and structural MR data 
from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The generative 
network was trained to generate realistic structural MR images from florbetapir 
PET images. After the training, the model was applied to the quantification of 
cortical amyloid load. PET images were spatially normalized to the template 
space using the generated MR, and then SUV ratio (SUVR) of the target regions 
was measured by predefined regions of interest. A real MR-based quantification 
was used as the gold standard to measure the accuracy of our approach. Other 
MR-less methods-a normal PET template-based, a multiatlas PET template-based, 
and a PET segmentation-based normalization/quantification-were also tested. We 
compared the performance of quantification methods using generated MR with that 
of MR-based and MR-less quantification methods. Results: Generated MR images 
from florbetapir PET showed signal patterns that were visually similar to the 
real MR. The structural similarity index between real and generated MR was 0.91 
± 0.04. The mean absolute error of SUVR of cortical composite regions estimated 
by the generated MR-based method was 0.04 ± 0.03, which was significantly 
smaller than other MR-less methods (0.29 ± 0.12 for the normal PET template, 
0.12 ± 0.07 for the multiatlas PET template, and 0.08 ± 0.06 for the PET 
segmentation-based methods). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the generated 
MR-based SUVR quantification was the closest to the SUVRs estimated by the real 
MR-based method. Conclusion: Structural MR images were successfully generated 
from amyloid PET images using deep generative networks. Generated MR images 
could be used as templates for accurate and precise amyloid quantification. This 
generative method might be used to generate multimodal images of various organs 
for further quantitative analyses.

Hippocampus Analysis by Combination of 3-D DenseNet and Shapes for Alzheimer's 
Disease Diagnosis.

Cui R, Liu M.

Hippocampus is one of the first involved regions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD. Hippocampal atrophy is 
a validated, easily accessible, and widely used biomarker for AD diagnosis. Most 
of existing methods compute the shape and volume features for hippocampus 
analysis using structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the regions 
adjacent to hippocampus may be relevant to AD, and the visual features of the 
hippocampal region are important for disease diagnosis. In this paper, we have 
proposed a new hippocampus analysis method to combine the global and local 
features of hippocampus by three-dimensional densely connected convolutional 
networks and shape analysis for AD diagnosis. The proposed method can make use 
of the local visual and global shape features to enhance the classification. 
Tissue segmentation and nonlinear registration are not required in the proposed 
method. Our method is evaluated with the T1-weighted structural MRIs from 811 
subjects including 192 AD, 396 MCI (231 stable MCI and 165 progressive MCI), and 
223 normal control in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative database. 
Experimental results show the proposed method achieves a classification accuracy 
of 92.29% and area under the ROC curve of 96.95% for AD diagnosis. Results 
comparison demonstrates the proposed method performs better than other methods.

We propose an adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) scheme proposed 
for segmenting brain lesions with considerable mass-effect, to segment white 
matter hyperintensities (WMH) characteristic of brains with none or mild 
vascular pathology in routine clinical brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). 
This is a rather difficult segmentation problem because of the small area (i.e., 
volume) of the WMH and their similarity to non-pathological brain tissue. We 
investigate the effectiveness of the 2D CNN scheme by comparing its performance 
against those obtained from another deep learning approach: Deep Boltzmann 
Machine (DBM), two conventional machine learning approaches: Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and a public toolbox: Lesion Segmentation 
Tool (LST), all reported to be useful for segmenting WMH in MRI. We also 
introduce a way to incorporate spatial information in convolution level of CNN 
for WMH segmentation named global spatial information (GSI). Analysis of 
covariance corroborated known associations between WMH progression, as assessed 
by all methods evaluated, and demographic and clinical data. Deep learning 
algorithms outperform conventional machine learning algorithms by excluding MRI 
artefacts and pathologies that appear similar to WMH. Our proposed approach of 
incorporating GSI also successfully helped CNN to achieve better automatic WMH 
segmentation regardless of network's settings tested. The mean Dice Similarity 
Coefficient (DSC) values for LST-LGA, SVM, RF, DBM, CNN and CNN-GSI were 0.2963, 
0.1194, 0.1633, 0.3264, 0.5359 and 5389 respectively.

OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationship between carotid atherosclerosis and 
cerebral cortical thickness and investigate whether cortical thickness mediates 
the association between carotid atheroma and relative cognitive decline.
METHODS: We assessed 554 community-dwelling subjects (male/female: 296/258) from 
the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging and 
carotid Doppler ultrasound studies at age 73 years. The relationship between 
carotid atherosclerosis markers (internal carotid artery stenosis, intima-media 
thickness, velocity, pulsatility, and resistivity indexes) and vertex-wide 
cerebral cortical thickness was examined cross-sectionally, controlling for 
gender, extensive vascular risk factors (VRFs), and intelligence quotient at age 
11 (IQ-11). We also determined the association between carotid stenosis and a 
composite measure of fluid intelligence at age 73 years. A mediation model was 
applied to examine whether cortical thickness mediated the relationship between 
carotid stenosis and cognitive function.
RESULTS: A widespread negative association was identified between carotid 
stenosis (median = 15%) and cerebral cortical thickness at age 73 years, 
independent of the side of carotid stenosis, other carotid measures, VRFs, and 
IQ-11. This association increased in an almost dose-response relationship from 
mild to severe degrees of carotid stenosis, across the anterior and posterior 
circulation territories. A negative association was also noted between carotid 
stenosis and fluid intelligence (standardized beta coefficient = -0.151, 
p = 0.001), which appeared partly (approximately 22%) mediated by carotid 
stenosis-related thinning of the cerebral cortex.
INTERPRETATION: The findings suggest that carotid stenosis represents a marker 
of processes that accelerate aging of the cerebral cortex and cognition that is 
in part independent of measurable VRFs. Cortical thinning within the anterior 
and posterior circulation territories partially mediated the relationship 
between carotid atheroma and fluid intelligence. Ann Neurol 2018;84:576-587.

OBJECTIVE: This study aims to develop an algorithm named AutoRef to delineate a 
reference region for quantitative PET amyloid imaging.
METHODS: AutoRef sets the reference region automatically using a distinguishing 
feature in the kinetics of reference region. This is reflected in the shapes of 
the tissue time activity curve. A statistical shape recognition algorithm of the 
gaussian mixture model is applied with considering spatial and temporal 
information on a reference region. We evaluate the BPND with manually set 
reference region and AutoRef using 86 cases (43 positive cases, 10 equivocal 
cases, and 33 negative cases) of dynamically scanned 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B.
RESULTS: From the Bland-Altman plot, the difference between two BPND is 
0.099 ± 0.21 as standard deviation, and no significant systematic error is 
observed between the BPND with AutoRef and with manual definition of a reference 
region. Although a proportional error is detected, it is smaller than the 95% 
limits of agreement. Therefore, the proportional error is negligibly small.
CONCLUSIONS: AutoRef presents the same performance as the manual definition of 
the reference region. Further, since AutoRef is more algorithmic than the 
ordinary manual definition of the reference region, there are few 
operator-oriented uncertainties in AutoRef. We thus conclude that AutoRef can be 
applied as an automatic delineating algorithm for the reference region in 
amyloid imaging.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) begins several decades before the onset of clinical 
symptoms, at a time when women may still undergo reproductive cycling. Whether 
ovarian functions alter substrates of AD pathogenesis is unknown. Here we show 
that ovarian cycle stages significantly modulate AD-related alterations in 
neural network patterns, cognitive impairments, and pathogenic protein 
production in the hAPP-J20 mouse model of AD. Female hAPP mice spent more time 
in estrogen-dominant cycle stages and these ovarian stages worsened AD-related 
network dysfunction and cognitive impairments. In contrast, 
progesterone-dominant stages and gonadectomy attenuated these AD-related 
deficits. Further studies revealed a direct role for estradiol in stimulating 
neural network excitability and susceptibility to seizures in hAPP mice and 
increasing amyloid beta levels. Understanding dynamic effects of the ovarian 
cycle on the female nervous system in disease, including AD, is of critical 
importance and may differ from effects on a healthy brain. The pattern of 
ovarian cycle effects on disease-related networks, cognition, and pathogenic 
protein expression may be relevant to young women at risk for AD.

Multi-View Separable Pyramid Network for AD Prediction at MCI Stage by (18)F-FDG 
Brain PET Imaging.

Pan X, Phan TL, Adel M, Fossati C, Gaidon T, Wojak J, Guedj E.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD), one of the main causes of death in elderly people, is 
characterized by Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) at prodromal stage. 
Nevertheless, only part of MCI subjects could progress to AD. The main objective 
of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop a dementia of AD type 
among MCI patients. 18F-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (18F-FDG 
PET) serves as a neuroimaging modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect 
neural activity via measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we 
design a deep network on 18F-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD 
identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable Pyramid 
Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are learned from 
axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to offer complementary 
information and then combined to make a decision jointly. Different from the 
widely and naturally used 3D convolution operations for 3D images, the proposed 
architecture is deployed with separable convolution from slice-wise to 
spatial-wise successively, which can retain the spatial information and reduce 
training parameters compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively. Experiments on 
ADNI dataset show that the proposed method can yield better performance than 
both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for predicting the 
progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment, with a classification accuracy of 
83.05%.

Background: Decreased bone mineral density (BMD) was associated with poorer 
cognitive function and increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, 
objective evidence for the relationship between osteoporosis and AD in humans 
has not been extensively described. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the 
relationships between BMD and the cortical volumes of brain regions vulnerable 
to AD; hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, precuneus, posterior cingulate, and 
angular gyrus, using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), to investigate the 
association between bone loss and AD. Methods: A cohort of 149 consecutive 
elderly participants who complained of memory disturbance underwent 
high-resolution structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). We used SPM12 software to conduct a 
voxel-based multiple regression analysis to examine the association between 
femoral neck BMD values and regional gray matter volume (rGMV) on structural 
T1-weighted MRI. Results: After adjusting for subject age, gender, total brain 
volume (TBV), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scores, the multiple 
regression analysis showed significant correlations between BMD loss and rGMV 
decline in the left precuneus, which is an important neural network hub 
vulnerable to AD. Conclusion: These data suggest that the bone and brain 
communicate with each other, as in "bone-brain crosstalk," and that control of 
BMD factors could contribute to cognitive function and help prevent AD.

PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This paper aims to review novel trends in cholinergic 
neuroimaging in Alzheimer and Lewy body parkinsonian disorders.
RECENT FINDINGS: The spectrum of cholinergic imaging is expanding with the 
availability of spatially more precise radioligands that allow assessment of 
previously less recognized subcortical and cortical structures with more dense 
cholinergic innervation. In addition, advances in MRI techniques now allow 
quantitative structural or functional assessment of both the cholinergic 
forebrain and the pedunculopontine nucleus, which may serve as non-invasive 
prognostic predictors. Multimodal imaging approaches, such as PET-MRI or 
multiligand PET offer new insights into the dynamic and interactive roles of the 
cholinergic system at both local and larger-scale neural network levels.
SUMMARY: Our understanding of the heterogeneous roles of the cholinergic system 
in age-related diseases is evolving. Multimodal imaging approaches that provide 
complimentary views of the cholinergic system will be necessary to shed light on 
the impact of cholinergic degeneration on regional and large-scale neural 
networks that underpin clinical symptom manifestation in neurodegeneration.

Hippocampus Segmentation Based on Iterative Local Linear Mapping With 
Representative and Local Structure-Preserved Feature Embedding.

Pang S, Lu Z, Jiang J, Zhao L, Lin L, Li X, Lian T, Huang M, Yang W, Feng Q.

Hippocampus segmentation plays a significant role in mental disease diagnoses, 
such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, and so on. Patch-based multi-atlas 
segmentation (PBMAS) approach is a popular method for hippocampus segmentation 
and has achieved a promising result. However, the PBMAS approach needs high 
computation cost due to registration and the segmentation accuracy is subject to 
the registration accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel method based on 
iterative local linear mapping (ILLM) with the representative and local 
structure-preserved feature embedding to achieve accurate and robust hippocampus 
segmentation with no need for registration. In the proposed approach, 
semi-supervised deep autoencoder (SSDA) exploits unsupervised deep autoencoder 
and local structure-preserved manifold regularization to nonlinearly transform 
the extracted magnetic resonance (MR) patch to embedded feature manifold, whose 
adjacent relationship is similar to the signed distance map (SDM) patch 
manifold. Local linear mapping is used to preliminarily predict SDM patch 
corresponding to the MR patch. Subsequently, threshold segmentation generates a 
preliminary segmentation. The ILLM refines the segmentation result iteratively 
by ensuring the local constraints of embedded feature manifold and SDM patch 
manifold using a space-constrained dictionary update. Thus, a refined 
segmentation is obtained with no need for registration. The experiments on 135 
subjects from ADNI dataset show that the proposed approach is superior to the 
state-of-the-art PBMAS and classification-based approaches with mean Dice 
similarity coefficients of 0.8852±0.0203 and 0.8783 ± 0.0251 for bilateral 
hippocampus segmentation of 1.5T and 3.0T datasets, respectively.

OBJECTIVE: The current study was conducted to improve the understanding of 
relationships between regional cortical amyloid load, glucose metabolism, 
cortical morphology (volume), and severity of clinical symptoms in patients with 
AD, MCI, and age-matched controls.
METHODS: To objectivize the radiological evaluation of patients with suspected 
AD, head-to-head multi-modality imaging studies were conducted using MRI and 
PET/CT with [18F]FDG and [18F]AV45 for visualization and quantitation of brain 
morphology, glucose metabolism, and amyloid levels, respectively. A total of 84 
subjects was studied, including 33 patients with AD, 31 patients with MCI, and 
20 age-matched healthy controls (HC). A new quantitative index was calculated as 
a ratio of regional SUV of [18F]AV45 (normalized to cerebellar cortex) over the 
corresponding regional SUV of [18F]FDG, divided by the corresponding regional 
volume, measured from the co-registered MRI and normalized to the normal 
age-matched control group (AV45/FDG/NVol index). Relationships between clinical 
scores (TMSE, ADAS) and AV45/FDG/NVol indices for different structures of the 
brain in study groups were determined using linear regression analyses.
RESULTS: A significant direct linear correlation was observed between the 
AV45/FDG/NVol index and ADAS-Cog test score and an inverse correlation with TMSE 
score at baseline and with the degree of changes in ADAS and TMSE scores 
assessed one year later (disease progression). The observed correlations between 
AV45/FDG/NVol index and clinical scores were higher than those with MRI-based 
cortical volumes, FDG SUV, or cerebellum-normalized AV45 SUV alone.
CONCLUSIONS: Current study demonstrated that AV45/FDG/NVol index mapping of the 
brain is a novel quantitative molecular imaging biomarker that correlates with 
clinical neurocognitive status and may facilitate more accurate diagnosis, 
staging, and prognosis of AD. Additional larger scale clinical studies are 
required to further evaluate the efficacy of this new quantitative index as a 
diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD as well as for the evaluation of 
safety and efficacy of novel agents undergoing clinical trials for therapy of 
AD.

Decision Supporting Model for One-year Conversion Probability from MCI to AD 
using CNN and SVM.

Shen T, Jiang J, Li Y, Wu P, Zuo C, Yan Z.

Prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) has 
become popular in recent years. Especially, deep learning technique has been 
used to extract high-quality features and for classification in this topic. 
Whether the patient would converse from MCI into AD is a particular evaluation 
criteria in clinics. However, there is no such a conversion prediction model in 
literature. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to propose a decision 
supporting model based on deep learning and machine learning to predict the 
conversion probability from MCI into AD within one year. We analyzed 165 samples 
with MRI scans from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, 
in which all MCI patients were converted into AD in different time span for 
conversion. In this model, we first extracted image features based on 
convolutional neural network (CNN) method, and then we used support vector 
machine (SVM) classifier to classify these features. The results showed that the 
classification accuracy using linear, polynomial and RBF kernel could achieve 
91.0%, 90.0% and 92.3%. As a result, this study indicated that the decision 
supporting model is potential to be applied into predicting the conversion 
probability from MCI into AD within one year.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive, neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by loss of synapses and disrupted functional connectivity (FC) 
across different brain regions. Early in AD progression, tau pathology is found 
in the locus coeruleus (LC) prior to amyloid-induced exacerbation of clinical 
symptoms. Here, a tau-seeding model in which preformed synthetic tau fibrils 
(K18) were unilaterally injected into the LC of P301L mice, equipped with 
multichannel electrodes for recording EEG in frontal cortical and CA1-CA3 
hippocampal areas, was used to longitudinally quantify over 20 weeks of 
functional network dynamics in (1) power spectra; (2) FC using intra- and 
intersite phase-amplitude theta-gamma coupling (PAC); (3) coherence, partial 
coherence, and global coherent network efficiency (Eglob) estimates; and (4) the 
directionality of functional connectivity using extended partial direct 
coherence (PDC). A sustained leftward shift in the theta peak frequency was 
found early in the power spectra of hippocampal CA1 networks ipsilateral to the 
injection site. Strikingly, hippocampal CA1 coherence and Eglob measures were 
impaired in K18-treated animals. Estimation of instantaneous EEG amplitudes 
revealed deficiency in the propagation directionality of gamma oscillations in 
the CA1 circuit. Impaired PAC strength evidenced by decreased modulation of the 
theta frequency phase on gamma frequency amplitude further confirms impairments 
of the neural CA1 network. The present results demonstrate early dysfunctional 
hippocampal networks, despite no spreading tau pathology to the hippocampus and 
frontal cortex. The ability of the K18 seed in the brainstem LC to elicit such 
robust functional alterations in distant hippocampal structures in the absence 
of pathology challenges the classic view that tau pathology spread to an area is 
necessary to elicit functional impairments in that area.

BACKGROUND: Fluorodeoxyglucose f18 positron emission tomography (18F-FDG PET) is 
regarded as the only functional neuroimaging biomarker for degeneration which 
can be used to increase the certainty of Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
pathophysiological process in research settings or as an optional clinical tool 
where available. Although a decline in FDG metabolism was confirmed in some 
regions known to be associated with AD, there was little known about the genetic 
association of FDG metabolism in AD cohorts. In this study, we present the first 
genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis of brain FDG metabolism.
METHODS: A total of 222 individuals were included from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative 1 (ADNI-1) cohort. All subjects were restricted to 
non-Hispanic Caucasians and met all quality control (QC) criteria. Associations 
of 18F-FDG with the genetic variants were assessed using PLINK 1.07 under the 
additive genetic model. Genome-wide associations were visualized using a 
software program R 3.2.3.
RESULTS: One significant SNP rs12444565 in RNA-binding Fox1 (RBFOX1) was found 
to have a strong association with 18F-FDG (P=6.06×10-8). Rs235141, rs79037, 
rs12526331 and rs12529764 were identified as four suggestive loci associated 
with 18F-FDG.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study results suggest that a genome-wide significant SNP 
(rs12444565) in the RBFOX1, and four suggestive loci (rs235141, rs79037, 
rs12526331 and rs12529764) are associated with 18F-FDG.

Learning and memory deficits characterize the diagnosis of amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment (aMCI), which is widely viewed as a clinical precursor to 
Alzheimer's type dementia. There is a growing interest in non-pharmacologic 
interventions, such as mnemonic strategies, for improving learning and memory in 
patients with aMCI as well as for maintaining functioning in healthy older 
adults. Using an ecologically relevant object-location association paradigm, we 
conducted a randomized, controlled, single-blind study in which healthy older 
adults and patients with aMCI were randomized to either mnemonic strategy 
training or a control group that was matched for stimulus exposure. We 
previously reported that mnemonic strategy training resulted in significantly 
greater learning and memory improvements compared to the matched exposure 
condition, in both aMCI patients and healthy controls. The current study 
examined changes in neocortical activation during encoding in a subset of 
participants who underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scanning 
both before and after training. To minimize potential confounds in between-group 
comparisons, we employed non-linear cortex based alignment and included only 
correctly encoded stimuli in our analyses. When re-encoding stimuli learned 
during training (i.e., trained stimuli), we found a general enhancement of 
activation in right prefrontal and parietal regions, possibly reflecting 
practice-related improvement in coordinate spatial processing in all but the 
aMCI exposure group. Left hemisphere activation was typically only evident in 
the mnemonic strategy trained participants, regardless of diagnostic status, 
with the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex appearing especially important for 
strategy use. While encoding relatively novel stimuli, both mnemonic strategy 
groups (aMCI patients and healthy controls) demonstrated increased activation in 
a subset of regions showing change for the trained stimuli, indicating a 
mnemonic strategy-induced change in the processing of new information. These 
findings could not be explained by repeated exposure since there was little to 
no activation overlap in the respective exposure control groups. The current 
results reinforce the potential benefits of cognitive interventions in these 
growing populations and indicate that neuroplastic change in key rostral and 
lateral prefrontal regions mediate this behavioral change.

In Alzheimer's research, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is an important 
intermediate stage between normal aging and Alzheimer's. How to distinguish MCI 
samples that finally convert to AD from those do not is an essential problem in 
the prevention and diagnosis of Alzheimer's. Traditional methods use various 
classification models to distinguish MCI converters from non-converters, while 
the performance is usually limited by the small number of available data. 
Moreover, previous methods only use the data at baseline time for training but 
ignore the longitudinal information at other time points along the disease 
progression. To tackle with these problems, we propose a novel deep learning 
framework that uncovers the temporal correlation structure between adjacent time 
points in the disease progression. We also construct a generative framework to 
learn the inherent data distribution so as to produce more reliable data to 
strengthen the training process. Extensive experiments on the ADNI cohort 
validate the superiority of our model.

In the present study, a novel mutation in the presenilin 1 gene was discovered 
in an Iraq-native patient with early-onset Alzheimer's disease, who presented 
with speech impairment and memory decline at age 46 years. Magnetic resonance 
imaging showed a frontotemporal atrophy. Sanger sequencing identified a 
heterozygous T to A transversion at position 815 (c.815T>A) in the presenilin 1 
gene (PSEN1), resulting in a novel missense mutation at codon 272 from valine to 
aspartate (V272D). We tested this PSEN1 mutation in vitro and found V272D 
resulted in an altered Aβ42/40 ratio.

INTRODUCTION: Downregulation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and its 
cognate neurotrophin receptor, TrkB, were observed during the progression of 
dementia, but whether the Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathological lesions diffuse 
plaques, (DPs), neuritic plaques (NPs), and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are 
related to this alteration remains to be clarified.
METHODS: Negative binomial (NB) regressions were performed using gene expression 
data accrued from a single population of CA1 pyramidal neurons and regional 
hippocampal dissections obtained from participants in the Rush Religious Orders 
Study (RROS).
RESULTS: Downregulation of Bdnf is independently associated with increased 
entorhinal cortex NPs. Downregulation of TrkB is independently associated with 
increased entorhinal cortex NFTs and CA1 NPs during the progression of AD.
DISCUSSION: Results indicate that BDNF and TrkB dysregulation contribute to AD 
neuropathology, most notably hippocampal NPs and NFTs. These data suggest 
attenuating BDNF/TrkB signaling deficits either at the level of BDNF, TrkB, or 
downstream of TrkB signaling may abrogate NPs and/or NFTs.

Deep kernel learning has been well explored for multi-class classification 
tasks; however, relatively less work is done for one-class classification (OCC). 
OCC needs samples from only one class to train the model. Most recently, kernel 
regularized least squares (KRL) method-based deep architecture is developed for 
the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension of this method by 
embedding minimum variance information within this architecture. This embedding 
improves the generalization capability of the classifier by reducing the 
intra-class variance. In contrast to traditional deep learning methods, this 
method can effectively work with small-size datasets. We conduct a comprehensive 
set of experiments on 18 benchmark datasets (13 biomedical and 5 other datasets) 
to demonstrate the performance of the proposed classifier. We compare the 
results with 16 state-of-the-art one-class classifiers. Further, we also test 
our method for 2 real-world biomedical datasets viz.; detection of Alzheimer's 
disease from structural magnetic resonance imaging data and detection of breast 
cancer from histopathological images. Proposed method exhibits more than 5% F1 
score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for various biomedical 
benchmark datasets. This makes it viable for application in biomedical fields 
where relatively less amount of data is available.

BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy-related inflammation (CAA-ri) is a rare 
clinical entity, characterized by headaches, seizures, rapidly progressive 
cognitive decline, behavioral changes and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
findings underlying the autoimmune and inflammatory reaction at the level of 
CAA-affected vessel. CAA-ri is likely responsive to corticosteroid. MRI shows 
asymmetric and multifocal white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions and multiple 
cerebral microbleeds. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 homozygosity is associated with 
CAA-ri strongly [Neurology 68(17):1411-1416, 2007, Ann Neurol 73(4):449-458, 
2013, J Alzheimers Dis 44(4):1069-1074, 2015]. SORL1 processes a causal 
involvement in Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a proposed modulator of the amyloid 
precursor protein (APP). It is unclear whether SORL1 is involved with CAA-ri or 
not.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 48-year-old woman suffered from a one-day history of a 
headache, nausea, and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed normal. We 
diagnosed this case as probable CAA-ri according to the clinic manifestations 
and MRI. Gene detection indicated a rare variant in SORL1 and ApoE ε4 
homozygosity. When treated with corticosteroid, the patient's clinical symptoms 
and MRI manifestations were almost relieved. However, when keeping the 
corticosteroid withdrawal for three months, the patient relapsed with a headache 
and typical images on MRI emerged. Corticosteroid therapy was effective again. 
Unfortunately, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) showed increased 
microbleeds. With tapering corticosteroid slowly, no recurrence was found on 
this patient with four-month follow-up.
CONCLUSION: A variant of SORL1 may be associated with CAA-ri, recurrence of 
disease could be detected with MRI by an increased microbleeds. Our case report 
suggests that corticosteroid therapy might be effective for CAA-ri.

BACKGROUND: Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its onset in 
subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on structural MRI 
features is one of the most important open issues in neuroimaging. Accordingly, 
a scientific challenge has been promoted, on the international Kaggle platform, 
to assess the performance of different classification methods for prediction of 
MCI and its conversion to AD.
NEW METHOD: This work presents a classification strategy based on Random Forest 
feature selection and Deep Neural Network classification using a mixed cohort 
including the four classes of classification problem, that is HC, AD, MCI and 
cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel 
classification strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including 
only HC and AD.
EXPERIMENTS: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed 
cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data included AD 
patients, MCI subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects and healthy 
controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy (38.8%) over 19 
participating teams.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD(S): The "International challenge for automated 
prediction of MCI from MRI data" hosted by the Kaggle platform has been promoted 
to validate different methodologies with a common set of data and evaluation 
procedures.
CONCLUSION: DNNs reach a classification accuracy significantly higher than other 
machine learning strategies; on the other hand, fuzzy logic is particularly 
accurate with cMCI, suggesting a combination of these approaches could lead to 
interesting future perspectives.

Amyloid imaging is a valuable tool for research and diagnosis in dementing 
disorders. Successful use of this tool is limited by the lack of a common 
standard in the quantification of amyloid imaging data. The Centiloid approach 
was recently proposed to address this problem and in this work, we report our 
implementation of this approach and evaluate the impact of differences in 
underlying image analysis methodologies using both cross-sectional and 
longitudinal datasets. The Centiloid approach successfully converts quantitative 
amyloid burden measurements into a common Centiloid scale (CL) and comparable 
dynamic range. As expected, the Centiloid values derived from different 
analytical approaches inherit some of the inherent benefits and drawbacks of the 
underlying approaches, and these differences result in statistically significant 
(p < 0.05) differences in the variability and group mean values. Because of 
these differences, even after expression in CL, the 95% specificity amyloid 
positivity thresholds derived from different analytic approaches varied from 5.7 
CL to 11.9 CL, and the reliable worsening threshold varied from -2.0 CL to 11.0 
CL. Although this difference is in part due to the dependency of the threshold 
determination methodology on the statistical characteristics of the 
measurements. When amyloid measurements obtained from different centers are 
combined for analysis, one should not expect Centiloid conversion to eliminate 
all the differences in amyloid burden measurements due to variabilities in 
underlying acquisition protocols and analysis techniques.

Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) require 
differential management despite presenting with symptomatic overlap. Currently, 
there is a need of inexpensive DLB biomarkers which can be fulfilled by 
electroencephalography (EEG). In this regard, an established 
electrophysiological difference in DLB is a decrease of dominant frequency 
(DF)-the frequency with the highest signal power between 4 and 15 Hz. Here, we 
investigated network connectivity in EEG signals acquired from DLB patients, and 
whether these networks were able to differentiate DLB from healthy controls 
(HCs) and associated dementias. We analysed EEG recordings from old adults: HCs, 
AD, DLB and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) patients. Brain networks were 
assessed with the minimum spanning tree (MST) within six EEG bands: delta, 
theta, high-theta, alpha, beta and DF. Patients showed lower alpha band 
connectivity and lower DF than HCs. DLB and PDD showed a randomised MST compared 
with HCs and AD in high-theta and alpha but not in DF. The MST randomisation in 
DLB and PDD reflects decreased brain efficiency as well as impaired neural 
synchronisation. However, the lack of network topology differences at the DF 
between all dementia groups and HCs may indicate a compensatory response of the 
brain to the neuropathology.

Cognitive reserve is inherently a dynamic construct; however, traditional 
methods of estimating reserve have focused on static proxy variables. A recently 
proposed psychometric approach entails modeling reserve as residual cognition 
not explained by demographic and brain variables. In this study, we extended 
this approach to longitudinal measurement and examined how change in reserve 
relates to clinical outcomes in late life and influences the effect of brain 
atrophy on cognitive decline. Results indicated that cognitive reserve changes 
were associated with progression of clinical diagnosis. More rapid depletion of 
cognitive reserve was associated with faster decline in nonmemory cognitive 
functions, even after accounting for longitudinal brain atrophy. The effect of 
longitudinal brain atrophy on cognitive decline differed based on the extent to 
which an individual's reserve changed. Whereas depletion of reserve appeared to 
unmask the effects of brain atrophy on cognitive decline, maintenance of reserve 
buffered against the negative effects of brain atrophy. Study results highlight 
that changes in reserve may have important implications for individual 
differences in cognitive aging trajectories.

INTRODUCTION: Given mounting calls to disclose biomarker test results to 
research participants, we explored factors underlying decisions by patients with 
mild cognitive impairment to receive amyloid imaging results.
METHODS: Prospective, qualitative interviews were conducted with 59 participants 
(30 = mild cognitive impairment patients, 29 = care partners) from the scan arm 
of a randomized controlled trial on the effects of amyloid PET results 
disclosure in an Alzheimer Disease Research Center setting.
RESULTS: Sixty-three percent of the participants were female, with an average 
age of 72.9 years, and most had greater than a high school level of education 
(80%). Primary motivations included: (1) better understanding one's mild 
cognitive impairment etiology and prognosis to plan ahead, and (2) learning 
one's brain amyloid status for knowledge's sake, regardless of whether the 
information is actionable. Most participants demonstrated an adequate 
understanding of the scan's limitations, yet instances of characterizing amyloid 
PET as a definitive test for Alzheimer's disease occurred. Mention of potential 
drawbacks, such as negative psychological outcomes, was minimal, even among care 
partners.
DISCUSSION: Findings demonstrate a risk of disproportionate focus on possible 
benefits of testing among amyloid scan candidates and suggest a need to clearly 
emphasize the limitations of amyloid PET when counseling cognitively impaired 
patients and their families before testing. Future research should examine 
whether minimizing drawbacks at the pre-imaging stage has adverse consequences 
on results disclosure.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, we developed a benzofuran derivative for the imaging of 
β-amyloid plaques, 
5-(5-(2-(2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzofuran-2-yl)-N-methylpyridin-2-amine 
(18F-FPYBF-2) (Ono et al., J Med Chem 54:2971-9, 2011). The aim of this study 
was to assess the feasibility of 18F-FPYBF-2 as an amyloid imaging PET tracer in 
a first clinical study with healthy volunteers and patients with various 
dementia and in comparative dual tracer study using 11C-Pittsburgh Compound B 
(11C-PiB).
METHODS: 61 healthy volunteers (age: 53.7 ± 13.1 years old; 19 male and 42 
female; age range 24-79) and 55 patients with suspected dementia [Alzheimer's 
Disease (AD); early AD: n = 19 and moderate stage AD: n = 8, other dementia: 
n = 9, mild cognitive impairment (MCI): n = 16, cognitively normal: n = 3] for 
first clinical study underwent static head PET/CT scan using 18 F - FPYBF-2 at 
50-70 min after injection. 13 volunteers and 14 patients also underwent dynamic 
PET scan at 0-50 min at the same instant. 16 subjects (volunteers: n = 5, 
patients with dementia: n = 11) (age: 66.3 ± 14.2 years old; 10 males and 6 
females) were evaluated for comparative study (50-70 min after injection) using 
18F-FPYBF-2 and 11C-PiB on separate days, respectively. Quantitative analysis of 
mean cortical uptake was calculated using Mean Cortical Index of SUVR 
(standardized uptake value ratio) based on the established method for 11C-PiB 
analysis using cerebellar cortex as control.
RESULTS: Studies with healthy volunteers showed that 18F-FPYBF-2 uptake was 
mainly observed in cerebral white matter and that average Mean Cortical Index at 
50-70 min was low and stable (1.066 ± 0.069) basically independent from age or 
gender. In patients with AD, 18F-FPYBF-2 uptake was observed both in cerebral 
white and gray matter, and Mean Cortical Index was significantly higher (early 
AD: 1.288 ± 0.134, moderate AD: 1.342 ± 0.191) than those of volunteers and 
other dementia (1.018 ± 0.057). In comparative study, the results of 18F-FPYBF-2 
PET/CT were comparable with those of 11C-PiB, and the Mean Cortical Index 
(18F-FPYBF-2: 1.173 ± 0.215; 11C-PiB: 1.435 ± 0.474) showed direct proportional 
relationship with each other (p < 0.0001).
CONCLUSIONS: Our first clinical study suggest that 18F-FPYBF-2 is a useful PET 
tracer for the evaluation of β-amyloid deposition and that quantitative analysis 
of Mean Cortical Index of SUVR is a reliable diagnostic tool for the diagnosis 
of AD.

OBJECTIVE: Recently, a benzofuran derivative for the imaging of β-amyloid 
plaques, 5-(5-(2-(2-(2-18F-fluoroethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)benzofuran-2-yl)- 
N-methylpyridin-2-amine (18F-FPYBF-2) has been validated as a tracer for amyloid 
imaging and it was found that 18F-FPYBF-2 PET/CT is a useful and reliable 
diagnostic tool for the evaluation of AD (Higashi et al. Ann Nucl Med, 
https://doi.org/10.1007/s12149-018-1236-1 , 2018). The aim of this study was to 
assess the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of diagnostic dosages of 
18F-FPYBF-2 in normal healthy volunteers as a first-in-man study.
METHODS: Four normal healthy volunteers (male: 3, female: 1; mean age: 40 ± 17; 
age range 25-56) were included and underwent 18F-FPYBF-2 PET/CT study for the 
evaluation of radiation exposure and pharmacokinetics. A 10-min dynamic PET/CT 
scan of the body (chest and abdomen) was performed at 0-10 min and a 15-min 
whole-body static scan was performed six times after the injection of 
18F-FPYBF-2. After reconstructing PET and CT image data, individual organ 
time-activity curves were estimated by fitting volume of interest data from the 
dynamic scan and whole-body scans. The OLINDA/EXM version 2.0 software was used 
to determine the whole-body effective doses.
RESULTS: Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated that the hepatobiliary and renal 
systems were the principal pathways of clearance of 18F-FPYBF-2. High uptake in 
the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach, and the kidneys were demonstrated, 
followed by the intestines and the urinary bladder. The ED for the adult 
dosimetric model was estimated to be 8.48 ± 1.25 µSv/MBq. The higher absorbed 
doses were estimated for the liver (28.98 ± 12.49 and 36.21 ± 15.64 µGy/MBq), 
the brain (20.93 ± 4.56 and 23.05 ± 5.03µ Gy/MBq), the osteogenic cells 
(9.67 ± 1.67 and 10.29 ± 1.70 µGy/MBq), the small intestines (9.12 ± 2.61 and 
11.12 ± 3.15 µGy/MBq), and the kidneys (7.81 ± 2.62 and 8.71 ± 2.90 µGy/MBq) for 
male and female, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: The ED for the adult dosimetric model was similar to those of other 
agents used for amyloid PET imaging. The diagnostic dosage of 185-370 MBq of 
18F-FPYBF-2 was considered to be acceptable for administration in patients as a 
diagnostic tool for the evaluation of AD.

PURPOSE: Hyperglycemia affects FDG uptake in the brain, potentially emulating 
Alzheimer's disease in normal individuals. This study investigates global and 
regional cerebral FDG uptake as a function of plasma glucose in a cohort of 
patients.
METHODS: 120 consecutive male patients with FDG PET/CT for initial oncologic 
staging (July-Dec 2015) were reviewed. Patients with dementia, cerebrovascular 
accident, structural brain lesion, prior oncology treatment or high metabolic 
tumor burden (recently shown affecting brain FDG uptake) were excluded. 53 (24 
nondiabetic) eligible patients (age 65.7 ± 2.8 mean ± SE) were analyzed with 
parametric computer software, MIMneuro™. Regional Z-scores were evaluated as a 
function of plasma glucose and age using multi variable linear mixed effects 
models with false discovery analysis adjusting for multiple comparisons. If the 
regression slope was significantly (p < 0.05) different than zero, hyperglycemia 
effect was present.
RESULTS: There was a negative inverse relationship (p < 0.001) between global 
brain FDG uptake and hyperglycemia. No regional hyperglycemia effect on uptake 
were present when subjects were normalized using pons or cerebellum. However, 
regional hyperglycemia effects were seen (p < 0.047-0.001) when normalizing by 
the whole brain. No obvious pattern was seen in the regions affected. Age had a 
significant effect using whole brain normalization (p < 0.04-0.01).
CONCLUSIONS: Cortical variation in FDG uptake were identified when subjects were 
hyperglycemic. However, these variations didn't fit a particular pattern of 
dementia and the severity of the affect is not likely to alter clinical 
interpretation.

Clinical predictions performed using structural magnetic resonance (MR) images 
are crucial in neuroimaging studies and can be used as a successful 
complementary method for clinical decision making. Multivariate pattern analysis 
(MVPA) is a significant tool that helps correct predictions by exhibiting a 
compound relationship between disease-related features. In this study, the 
effectiveness of determining the most relevant features for MVPA of the brain MR 
images are examined using ReliefF and minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance 
(mRMR) algorithms to predict the Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia, 
autism, and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Three 
state-of-the-art MVPA algorithms namely support vector machines (SVM), k-nearest 
neighbor (kNN) and backpropagation neural network (BP-NN) are employed to 
analyze the images from five different datasets that include 1390 subjects in 
total. Feature selection is performed on structural brain features such as 
volumes and thickness of anatomical structures and selected features are used to 
compare the effect of feature selection on different MVPA algorithms. Selecting 
the most relevant features for differentiating images of healthy controls from 
the diseased subjects using both ReliefF and mRMR methods significantly 
increased the performance. The most successful MVPA method was SVM for all 
classification tasks.

Computer aided diagnostic (CAD) has become a significant tool in expanding 
patient quality-of-life by reducing human errors in diagnosis. CAD can expedite 
decision-making on complex clinical data automatically. Since brain diseases can 
be fatal, rapid identification of brain pathology to prolong patient life is an 
important research topic. Many algorithms have been proposed for efficient brain 
pathology identification (BPI) over the past decade. Constant refinement of the 
various image processing algorithms must take place to expand performance of the 
automatic BPI task. In this paper, a systematic survey of contemporary BPI 
algorithms using brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is presented. A 
summarization of recent literature provides investigators with a helpful 
synopsis of the domain. Furthermore, to enhance the performance of BPI, future 
research directions are indicated.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to preliminarily evaluate an oral small 
molecule p38α kinase inhibitor in patients with early Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
for the effects on brain amyloid plaque load and episodic memory function, and 
to establish pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamics correlations if any effects 
identified on these parameters.
METHODS: Sixteen patients with early AD received a highly selective p38α 
inhibitor (neflamapimod) for 84 days (12 weeks). To obtain a broad range of 
plasma drug exposures, subjects randomized to receive either 40 mg (n = 9) or 
125 mg (n = 7) twice daily. Dynamic, 11C-PiB positron emission scans were 
performed at baseline and at Day 84 and quantitatively analyzed by reference 
parametric mapping. Episodic memory assessed as Wechsler Memory Scale (WMS) 
immediate and delayed recall composites.
RESULT: In the 11C-PiB analyses there were no main group level effects, though 
in the prespecified responder analysis (>7% reduction in 11C-PiB signal) there 
were three responders in the 40 mg, and one in the 125 mg group. There were 
statistically significant increases from baseline in mean WMS immediate recall 
score and WMS delayed recall at both day 28 (P = 0.03 and P = 0.001) and day 84 
(P = 0.001 and P < 0.001). Individual subject plasma drug concentration profiles 
were significantly positively correlated with the change in combined WMS 
immediate and delayed recall (P < 0.0001, r2 = 0.70). Within-subject effect size 
was 0.59 for immediate recall and 0.67 for delayed recall.
INTERPRETATION: Selective p38α inhibition in patients with early AD may improve 
episodic memory and potentially impact β-amyloid production. These preliminary 
clinical findings support conduct of a longer duration placebo-controlled study, 
particularly to confirm the effects on episodic memory function.

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether central speech processing ability, as measured 
by hearing in noise, differs between right and left ears in adults with 
Alzheimer's disease related dementia (AD) as well as whether differences in 
central speech processing ability correlate with an fMRI-based measurement of 
global functional brain connectivity.
METHODS: This prospective study was carried out at a tertiary referral center. 
Patients with an AD diagnosis and pure tone averages 40 dB HL or better were 
included. They were examined using resting-state fMRI and underwent central 
audiometric testing using the Dichotic Sentence Identification Test (DSI), the 
Dichotic Digits Test (DD), and the Synthetic Sentence Identification Test (SS), 
which test hearing in noise. DSI scores were correlated with resting-state fMRI 
connectivity between 361 distinct gray matter brain regions of interest (ROIs). 
Average global connectivity was calculated as mean functional connectivity 
between an ROI and the other 360 regions, a quantitative marker representing 
overall functional connectivity in the brain.
RESULTS: Sixteen subjects had adequate fMRI and hearing data. The average age 
was 71.5 years old (±6.0). The average DSI score for the left ear was 40% (±34%) 
compared to 90% (±10%) in the right ear (P < .001). No difference between ears 
was noted on the DD. SS does not differentiate between ears, but worsening 
scores were noted with increasing background noise. Of the fMRI ROIs, 269 of the 
361 had multiple comparison corrected significant correlations between global 
connectivity and DSI of the left ear (P = .004, r = .673), and all 269 showed 
higher functional connectivity for individuals with higher left DSI score. No 
correlations between DSI of the right ear and functional connectivity were 
found.
CONCLUSIONS: Correlation was noted between left sided DSI and functional 
connectivity in patients with AD. Auditory input from the left ear was more 
susceptible to impairment, suggesting that side-specific auditory input may 
influence central auditory processing.

Neurofilament light chain (NfL) is a protein that is selectively expressed in 
neurons. Increased levels of NfL measured in either cerebrospinal fluid or blood 
is thought to be a biomarker of neuronal damage in neurodegenerative diseases. 
However, there have been limited investigations relating NfL to the concurrent 
measures of white matter (WM) decline that it should reflect. White matter 
damage is a common feature of Alzheimer's disease. We hypothesized that serum 
levels of NfL would associate with WM lesion volume and diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) metrics cross-sectionally in 117 autosomal dominant mutation carriers (MC) 
compared to 84 non-carrier (NC) familial controls as well as in a subset 
(N = 41) of MC with longitudinal NfL and MRI data. In MC, elevated 
cross-sectional NfL was positively associated with WM hyperintensity lesion 
volume, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity and 
negatively with fractional anisotropy. Greater change in NfL levels in MC was 
associated with larger changes in fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and 
radial diffusivity, all indicative of reduced WM integrity. There were no 
relationships with NfL in NC. Our results demonstrate that blood-based NfL 
levels reflect WM integrity and supports the view that blood levels of NfL are 
predictive of WM damage in the brain. This is a critical result in improving the 
interpretability of NfL as a marker of brain integrity, and for validating this 
emerging biomarker for future use in clinical and research settings across 
multiple neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Machine learning models were used to discover novel disease 
trajectories for autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease.
METHODS: Longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging, amyloid positron 
emission tomography (PET), and fluorodeoxyglucose PET were acquired in 131 
mutation carriers and 74 non-carriers from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer 
Network; the groups were matched for age, education, sex, and apolipoprotein ε4 
(APOE ε4). A deep neural network was trained to predict disease progression for 
each modality. Relief algorithms identified the strongest predictors of mutation 
status.
RESULTS: The Relief algorithm identified the caudate, cingulate, and precuneus 
as the strongest predictors among all modalities. The model yielded accurate 
results for predicting future Pittsburgh compound B (R2  = 0.95), 
fluorodeoxyglucose (R2  = 0.93), and atrophy (R2  = 0.95) in mutation carriers 
compared to non-carriers.
DISCUSSION: Results suggest a sigmoidal trajectory for amyloid, a biphasic 
response for metabolism, and a gradual decrease in volume, with disease 
progression primarily in subcortical, middle frontal, and posterior parietal 
regions.

OBJECTIVE: C9orf72 expansion is the most common genetic cause of frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD). We examined aging trajectories of cortical thickness (CTh) and 
surface area in C9orf72 expansion adult carriers compared to healthy controls to 
characterize preclinical cerebral changes leading to symptoms.
METHODS: Data were obtained from the Genetic Frontotemporal Dementia Initiative. 
T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans were processed with CIVET 2.1 to 
extract vertex-wide CTh and cortical surface area (CSA). Symptomatic and 
presymptomatic subjects were compared to age-matched controls using 
mixed-effects models, controlling for demographic variables. Aging trajectories 
were compared between carriers and noncarriers by testing the "age by genetic 
status" interaction. False discovery rate corrections were applied to all 
vertex-wide analyses.
RESULTS: The sample included 640 scans from 386 subjects, including 54 
symptomatic C9orf72 carriers (72.2% behavioral variant FTD), 83 asymptomatic 
carriers, and 249 controls (age range = 18-86 years). Symptomatic carriers 
showed fairly symmetric reduction in CTh/CSA in most of the frontal lobes, in 
addition to large temporoparietal areas. Presymptomatic subjects had reduced 
CTh/CSA in more restricted areas of the medial frontoparietal lobes, in addition 
to scattered lateral frontal, parietal, and temporal areas. These differences 
were explained by faster cortical thinning linearly throughout adulthood in a 
similar anatomical distribution, with differences emerging in the early 30s. CSA 
reduction was also faster in mutation carriers predominantly in the 
ventrofrontal regions.
INTERPRETATION: C9orf72 mutation carriers have faster cortical thinning and 
surface loss throughout adulthood in regions that show atrophy in symptomatic 
subjects. This suggests that the pathogenic effects of the mutation lead to 
structural cerebral changes decades prior to symptoms. ANN NEUROL 2020 ANN

OBJECTIVE: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a condition intermediate between 
physiological brain aging and dementia. Amnesic-MCI (aMCI) subjects progress to 
dementia (typically to Alzheimer-Dementia = AD) at an annual rate which is 20 
times higher than that of cognitively intact elderly. The present study aims to 
investigate whether EEG network Small World properties (SW) combined with Apo-E 
genotyping, could reliably discriminate aMCI subjects who will convert to AD 
after approximately a year.
METHODS: 145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according to 
the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD (C-MCI, 71) or Stable 
(S-MCI, 74).
RESULTS: Results showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1, alpha2, 
beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD. Receiver Operating 
Characteristic(ROC) curve, based on a first-order polynomial regression of SW, 
showed 57% sensitivity, 66% specificity and 61% accuracy(area under the curve: 
AUC=0.64). In 97 out of 145 MCI, Apo-E allele testing was also available. 
Combining this genetic risk factor with Small Word EEG, results showed: 96.7% 
sensitivity, 86% specificity and 91.7% accuracy(AUC=0.97). Moreover, using only 
the Small World values in these 97 subjects, the ROC showed an AUC of 0.63; the 
resulting classifier presented 50% sensitivity, 69% specificity and 59.6% 
accuracy. When different types of EEG analysis (power density spectrum) were 
tested, the accuracy levels were lower (68.86%).
INTERPRETATION: Concluding, this innovative EEG analysis, in combination with a 
genetic test (both low-cost and widely available), could evaluate on an 
individual basis with great precision the risk of MCI progression. This 
evaluation could then be used to screen large populations and quickly identify 
aMCI in a prodromal stage of dementia. Ann Neurol 2018 Ann Neurol

IMPORTANCE: Patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) may progress 
to clinical Alzheimer disease (AD), remain stable, or revert to normal. Earlier 
progression to AD among patients who were β-amyloid positive vs those who were 
β-amyloid negative has been previously observed. Current research now accepts 
that a combination of biomarkers could provide greater refinement in the 
assessment of risk for clinical progression.
OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the ability of flutemetamol F 18 and other biomarkers to 
assess the risk of progression from aMCI to probable AD.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this multicenter cohort study, from 
November 11, 2009, to January 16, 2014, patients with aMCI underwent positron 
emission tomography (PET) at baseline followed by local clinical assessments 
every 6 months for up to 3 years. Patients with aMCI (365 screened; 232 were 
eligible) were recruited from 28 clinical centers in Europe and the United 
States. Physicians remained strictly blinded to the results of PET, and the 
standard of truth was an independent clinical adjudication committee that 
confirmed or refuted local assessments. Flutemetamol F 18-labeled PET scans were 
read centrally as either negative or positive by 5 blinded readers with no 
knowledge of clinical status. Statistical analysis was conducted from February 
19, 2014, to January 26, 2018.
INTERVENTIONS: Flutemetamol F 18-labeled PET at baseline followed by up to 6 
clinical visits every 6 months, as well as magnetic resonance imaging and 
multiple cognitive measures.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Time from PET to probable AD or last follow-up was 
plotted as a Kaplan-Meier survival curve; PET scan results, age, hippocampal 
volume, and aMCI stage were entered into Cox proportional hazards logistic 
regression analyses to identify variables associated with progression to 
probable AD.
RESULTS: Of 232 patients with aMCI (118 women and 114 men; mean [SD] age, 71.1 
[8.6] years), 98 (42.2%) had positive results detected on PET scan. By 36 
months, the rates of progression to probable AD were 36.2% overall (81 of 224 
patients), 53.6% (52 of 97) for patients with positive results detected on PET 
scan, and 22.8% (29 of 127) for patients with negative results detected on PET 
scan. Hazard ratios for association with progression were 2.51 (95% CI, 
1.57-3.99; P < .001) for a positive β-amyloid scan alone (primary outcome 
measure), 5.60 (95% CI, 3.14-9.98; P < .001) with additional low hippocampal 
volume, and 8.45 (95% CI, 4.40-16.24; P < .001) when poorer cognitive status was 
added to the model.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: A combination of positive results of flutemetamol F 
18-labeled PET, low hippocampal volume, and cognitive status corresponded with a 
high probability of risk of progression from aMCI to probable AD within 36 
months.

A Mixed-Effects Model for Detecting Disrupted Connectivities in Heterogeneous 
Data.

Bhaumik D, Jie F, Nordgren R, Bhaumik R, Sinha BK.

The human brain is an amazingly complex network. Aberrant activities in this 
network can lead to various neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis, 
Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, and autism. functional magnetic 
resonance imaging has emerged as an important tool to delineate the neural 
networks affected by such diseases, particularly autism. In this paper, we 
propose a special type of mixed-effects model together with an appropriate 
procedure for controlling false discoveries to detect disrupted connectivities 
for developing a neural network in whole brain studies. Results are illustrated 
with a large data set known as autism brain imaging data exchange which includes 
361 subjects from eight medical centers.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is the second most 
prevalent cause of degenerative dementia next to Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
Though current DLB diagnostic criteria employ several indicative biomarkers, 
relative preservation of the medial temporal lobe as revealed by structural MRI 
suffers from low sensitivity and specificity, making them unreliable as sole 
supporting biomarkers. In this study, we investigated how a deep learning 
approach would be able to differentiate DLB from AD with structural MRI data.
METHODS: Two-hundred and eight patients (101 DLB, 69 AD, and 38 controls) 
participated in this retrospective study. Gray matter images were extracted 
using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In order to compare the conventional 
statistical analysis with deep-learning feature extraction, we built a 
classification model for DLB and AD with a residual neural network (ResNet) type 
of convolutional neural network architecture, which is one of the deep learning 
models. The anatomically standardized gray matter images extracted in the same 
way as for the VBM process were used as inputs, and the classification 
performance achieved by our model was evaluated.
RESULTS: Conventional statistical analysis detected no significant atrophy other 
than fine differences on the middle temporal pole and hippocampal regions. The 
feature extracted by the deep learning method differentiated DLB from AD with 
79.15％ accuracy compared to the 68.41% of the conventional method.
CONCLUSIONS: Our results confirmed that the deep learning method with gray 
matter images can detect fine differences between DLB and AD that may be 
underestimated by the conventional method.

Hippocampal atrophy is often considered as one of the important biomarkers for 
early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is an irreversible 
neurodegenerative disorder. Traditional methods for hippocampus analysis usually 
computed the shape and volume features from structural Magnetic Resonance Image 
(sMRI) for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD as well as its prodromal stage, 
i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Motivated by the success of deep 
learning, this paper proposes a deep learning method with the multi-channel 
cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn the combined 
hierarchical representations of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries from the 
binary hippocampal masks for AD classification. First, image segmentation is 
performed to generate the bilateral hippocampus binary masks for each subject 
and the mask difference is obtained by subtracting them. Second, multi-channel 
3D CNNs are individually constructed on the hippocampus masks and mask 
differences to extract features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries for 
classification. Third, a 2D CNN is cascaded on the 3D CNNs to learn high-level 
correlation features. Finally, the features learned by multi-channel and 
cascaded CNNs are combined with a fully connected layer followed by a softmax 
classifier for disease classification. The proposed method can gradually learn 
the combined hierarchical features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries to 
enhance the classification. Our method is verified on the baseline sMRIs from 
807 subjects including 194 AD patients, 397 MCI (164 progressive MCI 
(pMCI) + 233 stable MCI (sMCI)), and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate 
that the proposed method achieves an AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of 88.4%, 
74.6% and 71.9% for AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI classifications, 
respectively. It proves the promising classification performance and also shows 
that both hippocampal shape and asymmetry are helpful for AD diagnosis.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is on the rise all over the world, and brings with it 
great challenges to medical care and heavy burdens to family and society. 
Accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis are of great importance. Tau 
positron emission tomography (PET) might offer novel insights and be of great 
assistance in monitoring disease progression and supporting the differential 
diagnosis. 18F-AV-1451, as the first Tau PET imaging agent approved by the Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA), has been of great potential in clinical trials. 
Here, we reviewed the synthesis and characteristics of 18F-AV-1451 and its role 
in monitoring AD progression and supporting the differential diagnosis.

Functional modules in the human brain support its drive for specialization 
whereas brain hubs act as focal points for information integration. Brain hubs 
are brain regions that have a large number of both within and between module 
connections. We argue that weak connections in brain functional networks lead to 
misclassification of brain regions as hubs. In order to resolve this, we propose 
a new measure called ambivert degree that considers the node's degree as well as 
connection weights in order to identify nodes with both high degree and high 
connection weights as hubs. Using resting-state functional MRI scans from the 
Human Connectome Project, we show that ambivert degree identifies brain hubs 
that are not only crucial but also invariable across subjects. We hypothesize 
that nodal measures based on ambivert degree can be effectively used to classify 
patients from healthy controls for diseases that are known to have widespread 
hub disruption. Using patient data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum 
Disorder, we show that the hubs in the patient and healthy groups are very 
different for both the diseases and deep feedforward neural networks trained on 
nodal hub features lead to a significantly higher classification accuracy with 
significantly fewer trainable weights compared to using functional connectivity 
features. Thus, the ambivert degree improves identification of crucial brain 
hubs in healthy subjects and can be used as a diagnostic feature to detect 
neurological diseases characterized by hub disruption.

The APOE ε4 allele is associated with impaired intrinsic functional connectivity 
in neural networks, especially in the default mode network (DMN). However, 
effective connectivity (EC) reflects the direct causal effects of one brain 
region to another, which has rarely been investigated. Recently, Granger 
causality analysis (GCA) proved suitable for the study of directionality in 
neuronal interactions. Using GCA, we examined the differences in the EC between 
the anterior medial prefrontal cortex/posterior cingulate cortex (aMPFC/PCC) and 
the whole brain in 17 ε4 carrying and 32 non-carrying cognitively intact elderly 
individuals. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed between the 
abnormal EC and cognition/neuropathological indices. Compared with the 
non-carriers, the results showed that the ε4 carriers exhibited decreased EC 
from the PCC to the whole brain in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), the anterior 
cingulate cortex (ACC), and the precuneus (PCu). Meanwhile, the ε4 carriers 
demonstrated increased EC from the whole brain to the aMPFC in the inferior 
parietal lobe (IPL) and the postcentral gyrus (PCG). The correlation analyses 
suggested that the EC from the IPL/PCG to the aMPFC was related to episodic 
memory in non-carriers, while the decreased EC from the PCC to the ACC was 
associated with increased levels of t-tau in the ε4 carriers. In ε4 carriers, a 
negative influence can be traced from the PCC to both the anterior and posterior 
DMN subsystems; meanwhile, the anterior DMN subsystem receives compensatory 
effects from the parietal cortex. Early increases in AD-related pathologies in 
the PCC may act as first factors during this pathological process.

Background/Objectives: Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has been associated with 
risk for Alzheimer's Disease (AD). Previous investigations have suggested that 
vascular risk factors (VRFs) were associated with cognitive decline and AD 
pathogenesis, and the intervention of VRFs may be a possible way to prevent 
dementia. However, in MCI, little is known about the potential impacts of VRFs 
on neural networks and their neural substrates, which may be a neuroimaging 
biomarker of the disease progression. Methods: 128 elderly Han Chinese 
participants (67 MCI subjects and 61 matched normal elderly) with or without 
VRFs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and alcohol 
drinking) underwent the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging 
(fMRI) and neuropsychological tests. We obtained the default mode network (DMN) 
to identify alterations in MCI with the varying number of the VRF and analyzed 
the significant correlation with behavioral performance. Results: The effects of 
VRF on the DMN were primarily in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex 
(DLPFC) (i.e., middle frontal gyrus). Normal elderly showed the gradually 
increased functional activity of DLPFC, while a fluctuant activation of DLPFC 
was displayed in MCI with the growing number of the VRF. Interestingly, the left 
DLPFC further displayed significantly dynamic correlation with executive 
function as the variation of VRF loading. Initial level of compensation was 
observed in normal aging and none-vascular risk factor (NVRF) MCI, while these 
compensatory neural processes were suppressed in One-VRF MCI and were 
subsequently re-aroused in Over-One-VRF MCI. Conclusions: These findings 
suggested that the dose-dependent effects of VRF on DLPFC were highlighted in 
MCI, and the dynamic compensatory neural processes that fluctuated along with 
variations of VRF loading could be key role in the progression of MCI.

Cortical thickness estimation performed in-vivo via magnetic resonance imaging 
(MRI) is an effective measure of brain atrophy in preclinical individuals at 
high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the high dimensionality of 
individual cortical thickness data coupled with small population samples make it 
challenging to perform cortical thickness feature selection for AD diagnosis and 
prognosis. Thus far, there are very few methods that can accurately predict 
future clinical scores using longitudinal cortical thickness measures. In this 
paper, we propose an unsupervised dictionary learning algorithm, termed 
Multi-task Sparse Screening (MSS) that produces improved results over previous 
methods within this problem domain. Specifically, we formulate and solve a 
multi-task problem using extracted top-p significant features from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) longitudinal data. Empirical 
studies on publicly available longitudinal data from ADNI dataset (N = 2797) 
demonstrate improved correlation coefficients and root mean square errors, when 
compared to other algorithms.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been widely applied to analysis 
and diagnosis of brain diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its 
prodrome, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Traditional methods usually 
construct connectivity networks (CNs) by simply calculating Pearson correlation 
coefficients (PCCs) between time series of brain regions, and then extract 
low-level network measures as features to train the learning model. However, the 
valuable observation information in network construction (e.g., specific 
contributions of different time points) and high-level (i.e., high-order) 
network properties are neglected in these methods. In this paper, we first 
define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure the 
correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are determined in a 
data-driven manner to characterize the contribution of each time point, thus 
conveying the richer interaction information of brain regions compared with the 
PCC method. Furthermore, we propose a wc-kernel based convolutional neural 
network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for extracting the hierarchical (i.e., 
from low-order to high-order) functional connectivities for disease diagnosis, 
by using fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to build dynamic CNs 
(DCNs) using the defined wc-kernels. Then, we define three layers to extract 
local (region specific), global (network specific) and temporal high-order 
properties from the constructed low-order functional connectivities as features 
for classification. Results on 174 subjects (a total of 563 scans) with rs-fMRI 
data from ADNI suggest that the our method can not only improve the performance 
compared with state-of-the-art methods, but also provide novel insights into the 
interaction patterns of brain activities and their changes in diseases.

BACKGROUND: Cortical gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) deterioration are 
signals of neurodegeneration and increased dementia risk; however, their 
specific etiologies in dementia-free aging is unclear.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to examine potentially modifiable 
risk factors of GM and WM degeneration in a well-characterized cohort of 
dementia-free elderly.
METHODS: 96 Okinawan elderly participants (age 83.6) from the Keys to Optimal 
Cognitive Aging Project (KOCOA) underwent MRI and cognitive evaluation. Serum 
markers of inflammation (interleukin-6 (IL-6), high sensitivity C-reactive 
protein), cerebrovascular disease (systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140+, 
hemoglobin A1C (HgbA1C), total cholesterol), and essential minerals (copper 
(Cu), magnesium, and calcium) were examined in relation to mean cortical 
thickness (MCT) and white matter hyperintensities (WMH), adjusting for age and 
gender. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses identified relationships between 
regional GM density and the above markers.
RESULTS: Decreased MCT was associated with SBP 140 + (p = 0.029) and increased 
serum IL-6 (p = 0.036), HgbA1C (p = 0.002), and Cu (p = 0.025). In VBM analyses, 
increased IL-6, HgbA1C, and Cu were associated with decreased GM density in 
temporal lobe regions. HgbA1C (p = 0.004) was associated with greater WMH 
volume.
CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral markers of Cu, CVD risk, and inflammation are associated 
with MRI-markers of decreased brain health in dementia-free Okinawan elderly, 
with regional cortical thinning in areas involved in early accumulation of 
Alzheimer's disease pathology. Results identify potentially modifiable 
biomarkers as targets in the prevention of dementia in older individuals.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent neurodegenerative condition that can 
lead to severe cognitive and functional deterioration. Functional magnetic 
resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed abnormalities in AD in intrinsic 
synchronization between spatially separate regions in the so-called default mode 
network (DMN) of the brain. To understand the relationship between this 
disruption in large-scale synchrony and the cognitive impairment in AD, it is 
critical to determine whether and how the deficit in the low frequency 
hemodynamic fluctuations recorded by fMRI translates to much faster timescales 
of memory and other cognitive processes. The present study employed 
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to 
estimate spontaneous synchrony variations in the functional neural networks with 
high temporal resolution. In a group of cognitively healthy (CH) older adults, 
we found transient (mean duration of 150-250 ms) network activity states, which 
were visited in a rapid succession, and were characterized by spatially 
coordinated changes in the amplitude of source-localized electrophysiological 
oscillations. The inferred states were similar to those previously observed in 
younger participants using MEG, and the estimated cortical source distributions 
of the state-specific activity resembled the classic functional neural networks, 
such as the DMN. In patients with AD, inferred network states were different 
from those of the CH group in short-scale timing and oscillatory features. The 
state of increased oscillatory amplitudes in the regions overlapping the DMN was 
visited less often in AD and for shorter periods of time, suggesting that 
spontaneous synchronization in this network was less likely and less stable in 
the patients. During the visits to this state, in some DMN nodes, the amplitude 
change in the higher-frequency (8-30 Hz) oscillations was less robust in the AD 
than CH group. These findings highlight relevance of studying short-scale 
temporal evolution of spontaneous activity in functional neural networks to 
understanding the AD pathophysiology. Capacity of flexible intrinsic 
synchronization in the DMN may be crucial for memory and other higher cognitive 
functions. Our analysis yielded metrics that quantify distinct features of the 
neural synchrony disorder in AD and may offer sensitive indicators of the neural 
network health for future investigations.

There is evidence of increased microglial activation in Parkinson's disease (PD) 
as shown by in vivo PET ligand such as 11 C-PK11195. In addition, diffusion 
tensor imaging (DTI) imaging reveals widespread changes in PD, especially when 
the associated dementia develops. In the present case series, we studied five 
subjects with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD). Our findings suggest that 
while DTI metrics mirror cognitive severity, higher 11 C-PK11195 binding seems 
to be associated with a relative preservation of both white matter tracts and 
cognition. Longitudinal studies are warranted to tackle the complex relationship 
between microglial activation and structural abnormalities in neurodegenerative 
conditions.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to identify white matter structural 
networks of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) dichotomized by β amyloid 
(Aβ) status and compare them using network-based statistics (NBS).
METHODS: Patients underwent whole-brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance 
imaging, detailed neuropsychological test and [18F]-Florbetaben amyloid positron 
emission tomography. We performed the NBS analysis to compare the whole-brain 
white matter structural networks extracted from diffusion tensor images.
RESULTS: One hundred sixteen participants (Aβ- cognitively normal [CN], n = 35; 
Aβ- aMCI, n = 42; Aβ+ aMCI, n = 39) were included. There was no subnetwork 
showing significant difference between Aβ+ aMCI and Aβ- aMCI. However, by 
comparing each aMCI group with control group, we found that supplementary motor 
areas were common hub regions. Intriguingly, Aβ+ aMCI showed reduced 
connectivity mainly in the medial frontal regions, while Aβ- aMCI showed 
somewhat uniform disruption when compared to CN.
CONCLUSION: Structural network analysis using network-based approach in aMCI may 
shed light on further understanding of white matter disruption in the prodromal 
stage of Alzheimer's disease.

BACKGROUND: The aim of the current paper is to provide the first comparison of 
computational mechanisms and neurofunctional substrates in adolescents with 
attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and adolescents with 
obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) during decision making under ambiguity.
METHODS: Sixteen boys with ADHD, 20 boys with OCD, and 20 matched control 
subjects (12-18 years of age) completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging 
version of the Iowa Gambling Task. Brain activation was compared between groups 
using three-way analysis of covariance. Hierarchical Bayesian analysis was used 
to compare computational modeling parameters between groups.
RESULTS: Patient groups shared reduced choice consistency and relied less on 
reinforcement learning during decision making relative to control subjects, 
while adolescents with ADHD alone demonstrated increased reward sensitivity. 
During advantageous choices, both disorders shared underactivation in ventral 
striatum, while OCD patients showed disorder-specific underactivation in the 
ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex. During outcome evaluation, shared 
underactivation to losses in patients relative to control subjects was found in 
the medial prefrontal cortex and shared underactivation to wins was found in the 
left putamen/caudate. ADHD boys showed disorder-specific dysfunction in the 
right putamen/caudate, which was activated more to losses in patients with ADHD 
but more to wins in control subjects.
CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest shared deficits in using learned reward 
expectancies to guide decision making, as well as shared dysfunction in 
medio-fronto-striato-limbic brain regions. However, findings of unique 
dysfunction in the ventromedial orbitofrontal cortex in OCD and in the right 
putamen in ADHD indicate additional, disorder-specific abnormalities and extend 
similar findings from inhibitory control tasks in the disorders to the domain of 
decision making under ambiguity.

Metabolic connectivity as showed by [18F] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron 
emission tomography (FDG-PET) reflects neuronal connectivity. The aim of this 
study was to investigate the genetic impact on metabolic connectivity in default 
mode subnetworks and its clinical-pathological relationships in patients with 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). We separately investigated the modulation of 2 default 
mode subnetworks, as identified with independent component analysis, by 
comparing APOE-ε4 carriers to noncarriers with AD. We further analyzed the 
interaction effects of APOE (APOE-ε4 carriers vs noncarriers) with PICALM 
(rs3851179-GG vs rs3851179-A-allele carriers) on episodic memory (EM) deficits, 
reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and decreased metabolic 
connectivity in default mode subnetworks. The metabolic connectivity in the 
ventral default mode network (vDMN) was positively correlated with EM scores 
(β =0.441, P < .001). The APOE-ε4 carriers had significantly lower metabolic 
connectivity in the vDMN than the APOE-ε4 carriers (t(96) = -2.233, P = .028). 
There was an effect of the APOE-PICALM (rs3851179) interactions on reduced CMRgl 
in regions of vDMN (P < .001), and on memory deficits (F3,93 =5.568, P = .020). 
This study identified that PICALM may modulates memory deficits, reduced CMRgl 
and decreased metabolic connectivity in the vDMN in APOE-ε4 carriers. [18F] 
FDG-PET-based metabolic connectivity may serve a useful tool to elucidate the 
neural networks underlying clinical-pathological relationships in AD.

Background: Mnemonic strategy training (MST) has been shown to improve cognitive 
performance in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), however, several 
questions remain unresolved. The goal of the present study was to replicate 
earlier pilot study findings using a randomized controlled design and to 
evaluate transfer effects and changes in brain activation. Methods: Thirty 
patients with a-MCI were randomized into MST or education program. At baseline, 
participants completed clinical and neuropsychological assessments as well as 
structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Interventions were 
administered individually and comprised four sessions, over 2 weeks. MST taught 
patients to use a three-step process to learn and recall face-name associations. 
Post-treatment assessment included fMRI, a separate face-name association task, 
neuropsychological tests, and measures of metamemory. Behavioral (i.e., 
non-fMRI) measures were repeated after one and 3-months. Results: Participants 
in the MST condition showed greater improvement on measures of face-name memory, 
and increased associative strategy use; effects that were accompanied by 
increased fMRI activation in the left anterior temporal lobe. While all 
participants reported greater contentment with their everyday memory following 
intervention, only the MST group reported significant improvements in their 
memory abilities. There was no clear indication of far-transfer effects to other 
neuropsychological tests. Conclusion: Results demonstrate that patients with 
a-MCI not only show stimulus specific benefits of MST, but that they appear 
capable of transferring training to at least some other cognitive tasks. MST 
also facilitated the use of brain regions that are involved in face processing, 
episodic and semantic memory, and social cognition, which are consonant with the 
cognitive processes engaged by training.

Face-name association is a relevant ability for social interactions and involves 
the ventral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices, particularly in the left 
hemisphere, bilateral hippocampal, fusiform gyrus and occipital regions. 
Previous studies demonstrated the primary role of the hippocampus for this 
ability in healthy subjects. However, no study has examined the participation of 
the left inferior frontal area, specially the left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG) 
in patients with ischemic vascular lesions. In the present study we addressed 
this issue and investigated the neural correlates and resting state functional 
connectivity of face-name memory encoding in ischemic patients with LIFG or 
without lesions in the left IFG (nLIFG) and healthy controls (HC) using fMRI. 
The main results showed that the nLIFG group demonstrated efficient compensation 
related to encoding and performance on face-name learning and recognition memory 
task, in addition to similar brain areas activated during task performance 
compared to healthy controls. Some of these areas were more activated in nLIFG 
group, indicating a compensation mechanism. In contrast, the LIFG group showed 
worse behavior performance, and no signs of an efficient compensation mechanism. 
Functional connectivity analysis suggested that the left IFG region seems to be 
important for maintaining the connectivity of the right fusiform gyrus or, 
perhaps, lesion in this area is associated to maladaptive reorganization. Our 
findings highlight the relevant role of the left IFG in face-name learning and 
encoding, possibly as a primary region in addition to the bilateral hippocampal 
formation and fusiform gyrus.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) refers to a measurable deficit in cognition in 
the absence of dementia or impairment in activities of daily living. Working 
memory impairment is among the earliest signs of MCI. Oscillatory analysis of 
working memory might be a potential tool for identifying patients at increased 
risk of developing dementia. Our study aimed to assess the temporospatial 
pattern of spectral differences during working memory maintenance between MCI 
patients and healthy controls and to compare the sources of oscillatory activity 
between the two groups. Event-related spectral perturbation of 17 MCI patients 
and 21 healthy control participants was studied with 128-channel EEG during the 
Sternberg working memory task. Source localization was performed by using the 
eLORETA software. Among the participants, 13 MCI and 15 control participants 
underwent a structural brain MRI examination. Event-related synchronization 
(ERS) in the alpha and beta frequency band was significantly lower in MCI 
patients compared to healthy control participants during retention. Both study 
groups showed significant memory load-related enhancement in both frequency 
band. In the MCI group, source localization revealed significantly attenuated 
beta oscillatory activity in the inferior and middle temporal gyrus, in the 
fusiform gyrus, and in the cuneus. Beta ERS correlated significantly with the 
size of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus. During 
the retention period, MCI is characterized by decreased alpha and beta ERS 
compared to controls indicating early impairment in neural networks serving 
working memory maintenance. The assessment of electrophysiological changes in 
the beta frequency range may provide a useful diagnostic tool for the early 
detection of cognitive impairment.

Many gene variants may impair our health and cognitive abilities at old age, but 
some of them paradoxically improve the same or similar functions at much younger 
age (antagonistic pleiotropy hypothesis). Such a diametric pattern may also hold 
true for the ancestral Apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 allele, which increases the 
risk for Alzheimer's disease and cognitive decline in old age, but may benefit 
(pre)frontal (executive) functions in young carriers. We therefore investigated 
potential cognitive benefits of the risk allele on cognitive control capacities 
and top-down control allocation ("metacontrol") in n = 190 healthy young adults. 
On a behavioral level, we found young APOE ε4 carriers to better adapt to 
different degrees of cognitive control requirements, with superior performance 
in case of high control demands. On a neurophysiological level, these group 
differences were reflected by modulations of the N450 component, which were 
rooted in activation differences of the superior frontal gyrus (SFG, BA8). Taken 
together, our results suggest that young ε4 carriers are more efficient than 
non-carriers at allocating cognitive control resources based on the actual task 
requirements (i.e. metacontrol), as they seem to experience less conflict/exert 
less effort and recruit fewer additional prefrontal areas when task set 
complexity increases. We further found that ε2 carriers processed implicit 
spatial stimulus features to a stronger degree than ε3 and ε4 carriers, but 
failed to benefit from this, as the additional information likely increased 
response selection conflicts. This finding should however be treated with ample 
caution as the group of ε2 carriers was comparatively small.

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate mutation-specific white matter (WM) integrity 
changes in presymptomatic and symptomatic mutation carriers of the C9orf72,MAPT, 
and GRN mutations by use of diffusion-weighted imaging within the Genetic 
Frontotemporal dementia Initiative (GENFI) study.
METHODS: One hundred and forty mutation carriers (54 C9orf72, 30 MAPT, 56 GRN), 
104 presymptomatic and 36 symptomatic, and 115 noncarriers underwent 3T 
diffusion tensor imaging. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the 
association between diffusion parameters and years from estimated symptom onset 
in C9orf72,MAPT, and GRN mutation carriers versus noncarriers. Post hoc analyses 
were performed on presymptomatic mutation carriers only, as well as left-right 
asymmetry analyses on GRN mutation carriers versus noncarriers.
RESULTS: Diffusion changes in C9orf72 mutation carriers are present 
significantly earlier than both MAPT and GRN mutation carriers - 
characteristically in the posterior thalamic radiation and more posteriorly 
located tracts (e.g., splenium of the corpus callosum, posterior corona 
radiata), as early as 30 years before estimated symptom onset. MAPT mutation 
carriers showed early involvement of the uncinate fasciculus and cingulum, 
sparing the internal capsule, whereas involvement of the anterior and posterior 
internal capsule was found in GRN. Restricting analyses to presymptomatic 
mutation carriers only, similar - albeit less extensive - patterns were found: 
posteriorly located WM tracts (e.g., posterior thalamic radiation, splenium of 
the corpus callosum, posterior corona radiata) in presymptomatic C9orf72, the 
uncinate fasciculus in presymptomatic MAPT, and the internal capsule (anterior 
and posterior limbs) in presymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. In GRN, most 
tracts showed significant left-right differences in one or more diffusion 
parameter, with the most consistent results being found in the UF, EC, RPIC, and 
ALIC.
INTERPRETATION: This study demonstrates the presence of early and widespread WM 
integrity loss in presymptomatic FTD, and suggests a clear genotypic 
"fingerprint." Our findings corroborate the notion of FTD as a network-based 
disease, where changes in connectivity are some of the earliest detectable 
features, and identify diffusion tensor imaging as a potential neuroimaging 
biomarker for disease-tracking and -staging in presymptomatic to early-stage 
familial FTD.

OBJECTIVE: Disturbed sleep due to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) might 
accelerate amyloidβ (Aβ) deposition, which can be a crucial factor in 
Alzheimer's disease. We studied Aβ deposition in untreated OSAS patients with 
normal cognition.
METHOD: We performed polysomnography (PSG) and Aβ imaging with [11C]-Pittsburgh 
compound B PET computed tomography (11C-PiB PET CT) in 14 untreated OSAS 
patients (apnea-hypopnea index: 43.8 ± 26.3/h).
RESULTS: The abnormal accumulation of enhanced 11C-PiB PET was observed only one 
patient with severe, but not the most severe.
CONCLUSIONS: The OSAS severity alone may not predict Aβ deposition in OSAS 
patients with normal cognition.

Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, a major component of the medial temporal lobe 
memory circuit, are selectively vulnerable during the progression of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). The cellular mechanism(s) underlying degeneration of these neurons 
and the relationship to cognitive performance remains largely undefined. Here, 
we profiled neurotrophin and neurotrophin receptor gene expression within 
microdissected CA1 neurons along with regional hippocampal dissections from 
subjects who died with a clinical diagnosis of no cognitive impairment (NCI), 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or AD using laser capture microdissection 
(LCM), custom-designed microarray analysis, and qPCR of CA1 subregional 
dissections. Gene expression levels were correlated with cognitive test scores 
and AD neuropathology criteria. We found a significant downregulation of several 
neurotrophin genes (e.g., Gdnf, Ngfb, and Ntf4) in CA1 pyramidal neurons in MCI 
compared to NCI and AD subjects. In addition, the neurotrophin receptor 
transcripts TrkB and TrkC were decreased in MCI and AD compared to NCI. Regional 
hippocampal dissections also revealed select neurotrophic gene dysfunction 
providing evidence for vulnerability within the hippocampus proper during the 
progression of dementia. Downregulation of several neurotrophins of the NGF 
family and cognate neurotrophin receptor (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC) genes correlated 
with antemortem cognitive measures including the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE), 
a composite global cognitive score (GCS), and Episodic, Semantic, and Working 
Memory, Perceptual Speed, and Visuospatial domains. Significant correlations 
were found between select neurotrophic expression downregulation and neuritic 
plaques (NPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), but not diffuse plaques (DPs). 
These data suggest that dysfunction of neurotrophin signaling complexes have 
profound negative sequelae within vulnerable hippocampal cell types, which play 
a role in mnemonic and executive dysfunction during the progression of AD.

Alzheimer is a degenerative disorder that attacks neurons, resulting in loss of 
memory, thinking, language skills, and behavioral changes. Computer-aided 
detection methods can uncover crucial information recorded by 
electroencephalograms. A systematic literature search presents the wavelet 
transform as a frequently used technique in Alzheimer's detection. However, it 
requires a defined basis function considered a significant problem. In this 
work, the concept of empirical mode decomposition is introduced as an 
alternative to process Alzheimer signals. The performance of empirical mode 
decomposition heavily relies on a parameter called threshold. In our previous 
works, we found that the existing thresholding techniques were not able to 
highlight relevant information. The use of Tsallis entropy as a thresholder is 
evaluated through the combination of empirical mode decomposition and neural 
networks. Thanks to the extraction of better features that boost the 
classification accuracy, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art 
in terms of peak signal to noise ratio and root mean square error. Hence, our 
methodology is more likely to succeed than methods based on other landmarks such 
as Bayes, Normal and Visu shrink. We finally report an accuracy rate of 80%, 
while the aforementioned techniques only yield performances of 65%, 60% and 40%, 
respectively.

With the increasing size of datasets used in medical imaging research, the need 
for automated data curation is arising. One important data curation task is the 
structured organization of a dataset for preserving integrity and ensuring 
reusability. Therefore, we investigated whether this data organization step can 
be automated. To this end, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that 
automatically recognizes eight different brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
scan types based on visual appearance. Thus, our method is unaffected by 
inconsistent or missing scan metadata. It can recognize pre-contrast T1-weighted 
(T1w),post-contrast T1-weighted (T1wC), T2-weighted (T2w), proton 
density-weighted (PDw) and derived maps (e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient and 
cerebral blood flow). In a first experiment,we used scans of subjects with brain 
tumors: 11065 scans of 719 subjects for training, and 2369 scans of 192 subjects 
for testing. The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 98.7%. In a second 
experiment, we trained the CNN on all 13434 scans from the first experiment and 
tested it on 7227 scans of 1318 Alzheimer's subjects. Here, the CNN achieved an 
overall accuracy of 98.5%. In conclusion, our method can accurately predict scan 
type, and can quickly and automatically sort a brain MRI dataset virtually 
without the need for manual verification. In this way, our method can assist 
with properly organizing a dataset, which maximizes the shareability and 
integrity of the data.

Medical imaging studies have collected high dimensional imaging data to identify 
imaging biomarkers for diagnosis, screening, and prognosis, among many others. 
These imaging data are often represented in the form of a multi-dimensional 
array, called a tensor. The aim of this paper is to develop a tensor partition 
regression modeling (TPRM) framework to establish a relationship between 
low-dimensional clinical outcomes (e.g., diagnosis) and high dimensional tensor 
covariates. Our TPRM is a hierarchical model and efficiently integrates four 
components: (i) a partition model, (ii) a canonical polyadic decomposition 
model, (iii) a principal components model, and (iv) a generalized linear model 
with a sparse inducing normal mixture prior. This framework not only reduces 
ultra-high dimensionality to a manageable level, resulting in efficient 
estimation, but also optimizes prediction accuracy in the search for informative 
subtensors. Posterior computation proceeds via an efficient Markov chain Monte 
Carlo algorithm. Simulation shows that TPRM outperforms several other competing 
methods. We apply TPRM to predict disease status (Alzheimer versus control) by 
using structural magnetic resonance imaging data obtained from the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study.

Neurological abnormalities identified via neuroimaging are common in patients 
with Alzheimer's disease. However, it is not yet possible to easily detect these 
abnormalities using head computed tomography in the early stages of the disease. 
In this review, we evaluated the ways in which modern imaging techniques such as 
positron emission computed tomography, single photon emission tomography, 
magnetic resonance spectrum imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging, 
magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance perfusion 
weighted imaging, magnetic resonance sensitive weighted imaging, and functional 
magnetic resonance imaging have revealed specific changes not only in brain 
structure, but also in brain function in Alzheimer's disease patients. The 
reviewed literature indicated that decreased fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in 
the temporal and parietal lobes of Alzheimer's disease patients is frequently 
observed via positron emission computed tomography. Furthermore, patients with 
Alzheimer's disease often show a decreased N-acetylaspartic acid/creatine ratio 
and an increased myoinositol/creatine ratio revealed via magnetic resonance 
imaging. Atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate 
gyrus can be detected early using structural magnetic resonance imaging. 
Magnetic resonance sensitive weighted imaging can show small bleeds and abnormal 
iron metabolism. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging can display 
brain function activity through cerebral blood oxygenation. Resting functional 
magnetic resonance imaging can display the functional connection between brain 
neural networks. These are helpful for the differential diagnosis and 
experimental study of Alzheimer's disease, and are valuable for exploring the 
pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVES: In patients with gout, maintaining too low serum uric acid (SUA) 
level with urate-lowering therapy is a concern because uric acid is thought to 
be neuroprotective. However, the relation between SUA and dementia remains 
debated. This study aimed to investigate the impact of SUA level on the 
incidence of dementia.
METHODS: We assessed the longitudinal association between SUA level and incident 
dementia (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Version IV 
(DSM-IV) criteria) in a large cohort of healthy older people from the community 
(Three-City Dijon cohort). Additionally, we investigated the relation between 
SUA level and MRI markers of brain ageing (white matter hyperintensity volume 
(WMHV), lacunes and hippocampal volume).
RESULTS: The study sample comprised 1598 people (mean (SD) age 72.4(4.1) years, 
38.3% male). During the 13,357 person-years of follow-up (median duration: 10.1 
years), dementia developed in 110 participants (crude incidence rate: 8.2/1000 
person-years). After multiple adjustments, the multivariate HR with the highest 
(≥75th percentile) versus lowest SUA level was 1.79 (95% CI 1.17 to 2.73; 
p=0.007). The association was stronger with vascular or mixed dementia (HR=3.66 
(95% CI 1.29 to 10.41), p=0.015) than Alzheimer's disease (HR=1.55 (95% CI 0.92 
to 2.61), p=0.10). There was a non-significant trend towards an association 
between high SUA level and extensive WMHV (p=0.10), a biomarker of small vessel 
disease, but not hippocampal volume (p=0.94) or lacunes (p=0.86). The 
association between SUA level and vascular or mixed dementia might be affected 
by interim strokes.
CONCLUSIONS: Risk of dementia, especially vascular or mixed dementia, may be 
increased with high SUA levels in elderly people.

BACKGROUND: In recent years, many convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been 
proposed for the classification of Alzheimer's disease. Due to memory 
constraints, many of the proposed CNNs work at a 2D slice-level or 3D 
patch-level.
OBJECTIVE: Here, we propose a subject-level 3D CNN that can extract the 
neurodegenerative patterns of the whole brain MRI and converted into a 
probabilistic Dementia score.
METHODS: We propose an efficient and lightweight subject-level 3D CNN featuring 
dilated convolutions. We trained our network on the ADNI data on stable Dementia 
of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) from stable normal controls (sNC). To 
comprehensively evaluate the generalizability of our proposed network, we 
performed four independent tests which includes testing on images from other 
ADNI individuals at various stages of the dementia, images acquired from other 
sites (AIBL), images acquired using different protocols (OASIS), and 
longitudinal images acquired over a short period of time (MIRIAD).
RESULTS: We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated balanced accuracy of 88%in 
differentiating sDAT from sNC, and an overall specificity of 79.5%and 
sensitivity 79.7%on the entire set of 7,902 independent test images.
CONCLUSION: Independent testing is essential for estimating the generalization 
ability of the network to unseen data, but is often lacking in studies using CNN 
for DAT classification. This makes it difficult to compare the performances 
achieved using different architectures. Our comprehensive evaluation 
highlighting the competitive performance of our network and potential promise 
for generalization.

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) have overlapping 
symptoms, and accurate differential diagnosis is important for targeted 
intervention and treatment. Previous studies suggest that the deep learning (DL) 
techniques have the potential to solve the differential diagnosis problem of 
FTD, AD and normal controls (NCs), but its performance is still unclear. In 
addition, existing DL-assisted diagnostic studies still rely on hypothesis-based 
expert-level preprocessing. On the one hand, it imposes high requirements on 
clinicians and data themselves; On the other hand, it hinders the backtracking 
of classification results to the original image data, resulting in the 
classification results cannot be interpreted intuitively. In the current study, 
a large cohort of 3D T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 
volumes (n = 4,099) was collected from two publicly available databases, i.e., 
the ADNI and the NIFD. We trained a DL-based network directly based on raw T1 
images to classify FTD, AD and corresponding NCs. And we evaluated the 
convergence speed, differential diagnosis ability, robustness and 
generalizability under nine scenarios. The proposed network yielded an accuracy 
of 91.83% based on the most common T1-weighted sequence [magnetization-prepared 
rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)]. The knowledge learned by the DL 
network through multiple classification tasks can also be used to solve 
subproblems, and the knowledge is generalizable and not limited to a specified 
dataset. Furthermore, we applied a gradient visualization algorithm based on 
guided backpropagation to calculate the contribution graph, which tells us 
intuitively why the DL-based networks make each decision. The regions making 
valuable contributions to FTD were more widespread in the right frontal white 
matter regions, while the left temporal, bilateral inferior frontal and 
parahippocampal regions were contributors to the classification of AD. Our 
results demonstrated that DL-based networks have the ability to solve the enigma 
of differential diagnosis of diseases without any hypothesis-based 
preprocessing. Moreover, they may mine the potential patterns that may be 
different from human clinicians, which may provide new insight into the 
understanding of FTD and AD.

The contributors to persistent cognitive impairment and hippocampal atrophy in 
leucine-rich glioma-inactivated 1 antibody encephalitis (LGI1) patients are 
unknown. We evaluated whether tau neuropathology measured with [18 
F]flortaucipir PET neuroimaging associated with persistent cognitive impairment 
and hippocampal atrophy in four recovering LGI1 patients (3 men; median age, 67 
[37-88] years). Imaging findings in cases were compared with those observed in 
age- and gender-similar cognitively normal individuals (n = 124) and individuals 
with early-symptomatic Alzheimer disease (n = 11). Elevated [18 F]flortaucipir 
retention was observed in the two LGI1 patients with hippocampal atrophy and 
persistent cognitive impairment, including one with autopsy-confirmed Alzheimer 
disease. Tau neuropathology may associate with cognitive complaints and 
hippocampal atrophy in recovering LGI1 patients.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection using magnetic resonance image (MRI), 
plays a crucial role in the treatment of dementia disease at an early stage. 
Deep learning architecture produces impressive results in such research. 
Algorithms require a large number of annotated datasets for training the model. 
In this study, we overcome this issue by using layer-wise transfer learning as 
well as tissue segmentation of brain images to diagnose the early stage of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In layer-wise transfer learning, we used the VGG 
architecture family with pre-trained weights. The proposed model segregates 
between normal control (NC), the early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), the 
late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and the AD. In this paper, 85 NC 
patients, 70 EMCI, 70 LMCI, and 75 AD patients access form the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Tissue segmentation was applied 
on each subject to extract the gray matter (GM) tissue. In order to check the 
validity, the proposed method is tested on preprocessing data and achieved the 
highest rates of the classification accuracy on AD vs NC is 98.73%, also 
distinguish between EMCI vs LMCI patients testing accuracy 83.72%, whereas 
remaining classes accuracy is more than 80%. Finally, we provide a comparative 
analysis with other studies which shows that the proposed model outperformed the 
state-of-the-art models in terms of testing accuracy.

There are many kinds of brain abnormalities that cause changes in different 
parts of the brain. Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition that degenerates 
the cells of the brain leading to memory asthenia. Cognitive mental troubles 
such as forgetfulness and confusion are one of the most important features of 
Alzheimer's patients. In the literature, several image processing techniques, as 
well as machine learning strategies, were introduced for the diagnosis of the 
disease. This study is aimed at recognizing the presence of Alzheimer's disease 
based on the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. We adopted a deep learning 
methodology for the discrimination between Alzheimer's patients and healthy 
patients from 2D anatomical slices collected using magnetic resonance imaging. 
Most of the previous researches were based on the implementation of a 3D 
convolutional neural network, whereas we incorporated the usage of 2D slices as 
input to the convolutional neural network. The data set of this research was 
obtained from the OASIS website. We trained the convolutional neural network 
structure using the 2D slices to exhibit the deep network weightings that we 
named as the Alzheimer Network (AlzNet). The accuracy of our enhanced network 
was 99.30%. This work investigated the effects of many parameters on AlzNet, 
such as the number of layers, number of filters, and dropout rate. The results 
were interesting after using many performance metrics for evaluating the 
proposed AlzNet.

In brain structural segmentation, multi-atlas strategies are increasingly being 
used over single-atlas strategies because of their ability to fit a wider 
anatomical variability. Patch-based label fusion (PBLF) is a type of such 
multi-atlas approaches that labels each target point as a weighted combination 
of neighboring atlas labels, where atlas points with higher local similarity to 
the target contribute more strongly to label fusion. PBLF can be potentially 
improved by increasing the discriminative capabilities of the local image 
similarity measurements. We propose a framework to compute patch embeddings 
using neural networks so as to increase discriminative abilities of 
similarity-based weighted voting in PBLF. As particular cases, our framework 
includes embeddings with different complexities, namely, a simple scaling, an 
affine transformation, and non-linear transformations. We compare our method 
with state-of-the-art alternatives in whole hippocampus and hippocampal 
subfields segmentation experiments using publicly available datasets. Results 
show that even the simplest versions of our method outperform standard PBLF, 
thus evidencing the benefits of discriminative learning. More complex 
transformation models tended to achieve better results than simpler ones, 
obtaining a considerable increase in average Dice score compared to standard 
PBLF.

Significant data suggest that soluble Aβ oligomers play an important role in 
Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there is great confusion over what exactly 
constitutes an Aβ oligomer and which oligomers are toxic. Most studies have 
utilized synthetic Aβ peptides, but the relevance of these test tube experiments 
to the conditions that prevail in AD is uncertain. A few groups have studied Aβ 
extracted from human brain, but they employed vigorous tissue homogenization 
which is likely to release insoluble Aβ that was sequestered in plaques during 
life. Several studies have found such extracts to possess disease-relevant 
activity and considerable efforts are being made to purify and better understand 
the forms of Aβ therein. Here, we compared the abundance of Aβ in AD extracts 
prepared by traditional homogenization versus using a far gentler extraction, 
and assessed their bioactivity via real-time imaging of iPSC-derived human 
neurons plus the sensitive functional assay of long-term potentiation. 
Surprisingly, the amount of Aβ retrieved by gentle extraction constituted only a 
small portion of that released by traditional homogenization, but this readily 
diffusible fraction retained all of the Aβ-dependent neurotoxic activity. Thus, 
the bulk of Aβ extractable from AD brain was innocuous, and only the small 
portion that was aqueously diffusible caused toxicity. This unexpected finding 
predicts that generic anti-oligomer therapies, including Aβ antibodies now in 
trials, may be bound up by the large pool of inactive oligomers, whereas agents 
that specifically target the small pool of diffusible, bioactive Aβ would be 
more useful. Furthermore, our results indicate that efforts to purify and target 
toxic Aβ must employ assays of disease-relevant activity. The approaches 
described here should enable these efforts, and may assist the study of other 
disease-associated aggregation-prone proteins.

PURPOSE: Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) used to quantify amyloid-β 
burden from amyloid-PET scans can be biased by variations in the tracer's 
nonspecific (NS) binding caused by the presence of cerebrovascular disease 
(CeVD). In this work, we propose a novel amyloid-PET quantification approach 
that harnesses the intermodal image translation capability of convolutional 
networks to remove this undesirable source of variability.
METHODS: Paired MR and PET images exhibiting very low specific uptake were 
selected from a Singaporean amyloid-PET study involving 172 participants with 
different severities of CeVD. Two convolutional neural networks (CNN), ScaleNet 
and HighRes3DNet, and one conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) were 
trained to map structural MR to NS PET images. NS estimates generated for all 
subjects using the most promising network were then subtracted from SUVr images 
to determine specific amyloid load only (SAβL). Associations of SAβL with 
various cognitive and functional test scores were then computed and compared to 
results using conventional SUVr.
RESULTS: Multimodal ScaleNet outperformed other networks in predicting the NS 
content in cortical gray matter with a mean relative error below 2%. Compared to 
SUVr, SAβL showed increased association with cognitive and functional test 
scores by up to 67%.
CONCLUSION: Removing the undesirable NS uptake from the amyloid load measurement 
is possible using deep learning and substantially improves its accuracy. This 
novel analysis approach opens a new window of opportunity for improved data 
modeling in Alzheimer's disease and for other neurodegenerative diseases that 
utilize PET imaging.

Permutation Jaccard Distance-Based Hierarchical Clustering to Estimate EEG 
Network Density Modifications in MCI Subjects.

Mammone N, Ieracitano C, Adeli H, Bramanti A, Morabito FC.

In this paper, a novel electroencephalographic (EEG)-based method is introduced 
for the quantification of brain-electrical connectivity changes over a 
longitudinal evaluation of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects. In the 
proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the 
coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is 
then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity 
estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of 
the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two 
different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation 
Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series 
introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a 
follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and 
at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have 
converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the 
converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a 
reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and θ bands and in the 
overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, 
converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband 
(delta, θ, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, 
the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed 
method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach, appears to 
provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density modifications 
associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing noninvasive EEG signals.

INTRODUCTION: Therapeutic strategies targeting protein aggregations are ready 
for clinical trials in atypical parkinsonian disorders. Therefore, there is an 
urgent need for neuroimaging biomarkers to help with the early detection of 
neurodegenerative processes, the early differentiation of the underlying 
pathology, and the objective assessment of disease progression. However, there 
currently is not yet a consensus in the field on how to describe utility of 
biomarkers for clinical trials in atypical parkinsonian disorders.
METHODS: To promote standardized use of neuroimaging biomarkers for clinical 
trials, we aimed to develop a conceptual framework to characterize in more 
detail the kind of neuroimaging biomarkers needed in atypical parkinsonian 
disorders, identify the current challenges in ascribing utility of these 
biomarkers, and propose criteria for a system that may guide future studies.
RESULTS: As a consensus outcome, we describe the main challenges in ascribing 
utility of neuroimaging biomarkers in atypical parkinsonian disorders, and we 
propose a conceptual framework that includes a graded system for the description 
of utility of a specific neuroimaging measure. We included separate categories 
for the ability to accurately identify an intention-to-treat patient population 
early in the disease (Early), to accurately detect a specific underlying 
pathology (Specific), and the ability to monitor disease progression 
(Progression).
DISCUSSION: We suggest that the advancement of standardized neuroimaging in the 
field of atypical parkinsonian disorders will be furthered by a well-defined 
reference frame for the utility of biomarkers. The proposed utility system 
allows a detailed and graded description of the respective strengths of 
neuroimaging biomarkers in the currently most relevant areas of application in 
clinical trials.

Prior efforts to image cholinergic projections in human brain in vivo had 
significant technical limitations. We used the vesicular acetylcholine 
transporter (VAChT) ligand [18 F]fluoroethoxybenzovesamicol ([18 F]FEOBV) and 
positron emission tomography to determine the regional distribution of VAChT 
binding sites in normal human brain. We studied 29 subjects (mean age 47 [range 
20-81] years; 18 men; 11 women). [18 F]FEOBV binding was highest in striatum, 
intermediate in the amygdala, hippocampal formation, thalamus, rostral 
brainstem, some cerebellar regions, and lower in other regions. Neocortical [18 
F]FEOBV binding was inhomogeneous with relatively high binding in insula, BA24, 
BA25, BA27, BA28, BA34, BA35, pericentral cortex, and lowest in BA17-19. 
Thalamic [18 F]FEOBV binding was inhomogeneous with greatest binding in the 
lateral geniculate nuclei and relatively high binding in medial and posterior 
thalamus. Cerebellar cortical [18 F]FEOBV binding was high in vermis and 
flocculus, and lower in the lateral cortices. Brainstem [18 F]FEOBV binding was 
most prominent at the mesopontine junction, likely associated with the 
pedunculopontine-laterodorsal tegmental complex. Significant [18 F]FEOBV binding 
was present throughout the brainstem. Some regions, including the striatum, 
primary sensorimotor cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex exhibited age-related 
decreases in [18 F]FEOBV binding. These results are consistent with prior 
studies of cholinergic projections in other species and prior postmortem human 
studies. There is a distinctive pattern of human neocortical VChAT expression. 
The patterns of thalamic and cerebellar cortical cholinergic terminal 
distribution are likely unique to humans. Normal aging is associated with 
regionally specific reductions in [18 F]FEOBV binding in some cortical regions 
and the striatum.

In recent years, interest has grown in using computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). However, existing CAD technologies often overfit data and have poor 
generalizability. In this study, we proposed a sparse-response deep belief 
network (SR-DBN) model based on rate distortion (RD) theory and an extreme 
learning machine (ELM) model to distinguish AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC). 
We used [18F]-AV45 positron emission computed tomography (PET) and magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) images from 340 subjects enrolled in the ADNI database, 
including 116 AD, 82 MCI, and 142 NC subjects. The model was evaluated using 
five-fold cross-validation. In the whole model, fast principal component 
analysis (PCA) served as a dimension reduction algorithm. An SR-DBN extracted 
features from the images, and an ELM obtained the classification. Furthermore, 
to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we performed comparative trials. In 
contrast experiment 1, the ELM was replaced by a support vector machine (SVM). 
Contrast experiment 2 adopted DBN without sparsity. Contrast experiment 3 
consisted of fast PCA and an ELM. Contrast experiment 4 used a classic 
convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify AD. Accuracy, sensitivity, 
specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were examined to validate the 
results. Our model achieved 91.68% accuracy, 95.47% sensitivity, 86.68% 
specificity, and an AUC of 0.87 separating between AD and NC groups; 87.25% 
accuracy, 79.74% sensitivity, 91.58% specificity, and an AUC of 0.79 separating 
MCI and NC groups; and 80.35% accuracy, 85.65% sensitivity, 72.98% specificity, 
and an AUC of 0.71 separating AD and MCI groups, which gave better 
classification than other models assessed.

Functional connectivity networks, derived from resting-state fMRI data, have 
been found as effective biomarkers for identifying mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) from healthy elderly. However, the traditional functional connectivity 
network is essentially a low-order network with the assumption that the brain 
activity is static over the entire scanning period, ignoring temporal variations 
among the correlations derived from brain region pairs. To overcome this 
limitation, we proposed a new type of sparse functional connectivity network to 
precisely describe the relationship of temporal correlations among brain 
regions. Specifically, instead of using the simple pairwise Pearson's 
correlation coefficient as connectivity, we first estimate the temporal 
low-order functional connectivity for each region pair based on an ULS Group 
constrained-UOLS regression algorithm, where a combination of ultra-least 
squares (ULS) criterion with a Group constrained topology structure detection 
algorithm is applied to detect the topology of functional connectivity networks, 
aided by an Ultra-Orthogonal Least Squares (UOLS) algorithm to estimate 
connectivity strength. Compared to the classical least squares criterion which 
only measures the discrepancy between the observed signals and the model 
prediction function, the ULS criterion takes into consideration the discrepancy 
between the weak derivatives of the observed signals and the model prediction 
function and thus avoids the overfitting problem. By using a similar approach, 
we then estimate the high-order functional connectivity from the low-order 
connectivity to characterize signal flows among the brain regions. We finally 
fuse the low-order and the high-order networks using two decision trees for MCI 
classification. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the 
proposed method on MCI classification.

The amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) feature prominently in the synaptic 
dysfunction and neuronal loss associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). This has 
been proposed to be due either to interactions between Aβ and cell surface 
receptors affecting cell signaling, or to the formation of calcium-permeable 
channels in the membrane that disrupt calcium homeostasis. In both mechanisms 
the cell membrane is the primary cellular structure with which Aβ interacts. Aβ 
concentrations in human bodily fluids are very low (pM-nM) rendering studies of 
the size, composition, cellular binding sites and mechanism of action of the 
oligomers formed in vivo very challenging. Most studies, therefore, have 
utilized Aβ oligomers prepared at micromolar peptide concentrations, where Aβ 
forms oligomeric species which possess easily observable cell toxicity. Such 
toxicity has not been observed when nM concentrations of peptide are used in the 
experiment highlighting the importance of employing physiologically relevant 
peptide concentrations for the results to be of biological significance. In this 
paper single-molecule microscopy was used to monitor Aβ oligomer formation and 
diffusion on a supported lipid bilayer at nanomolar peptide concentrations. Aβ 
monomers, the dominant species in solution, tightly associate with the membrane 
and are highly mobile whereas trimers and higher-order oligomers are largely 
immobile. Aβ dimers exist in a mixture of mobile and immobile states. Oligomer 
growth on the membrane is more rapid for Aβ40 than for the more amyloidogenic 
Aβ42 but is largely inhibited for a 1:1 Aβ40:Aβ42 mixture. The mechanism 
underlying these Aβ40-Aβ42 interactions may feature in Alzheimer's pathology.

The PET ligand [18F]AV-1451 was developed to bind tau pathology in Alzheimer's 
disease, but increased binding has been shown in both genetic tauopathies and in 
semantic dementia, a disease strongly associated with TDP-43 pathology. Here we 
assessed [18F]AV-1451 binding in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia due 
to a hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9orf72, characterized by TDP-43 
pathology. We show that the C9orf72 mutation increases binding in frontotemporal 
cortex, with a distinctive distribution of binding compared with healthy 
controls.

Novel Effective Connectivity Inference Using Ultra-Group Constrained Orthogonal 
Forward Regression and Elastic Multilayer Perceptron Classifier for MCI 
Identification.

Li Y, Yang H, Lei B, Liu J, Wee CY.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) detection is important, such that appropriate 
interventions can be imposed to delay or prevent its progression to severe 
stages, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Brain connectivity network inferred 
from the functional magnetic resonance imaging data has been prevalently used to 
identify the individuals with MCI/AD from the normal controls. The capability to 
detect the causal or effective connectivity is highly desirable for 
understanding directed functional interactions between brain regions and further 
helping the detection of MCI. In this paper, we proposed a novel sparse 
constrained effective connectivity inference method and an elastic multilayer 
perceptron classifier for MCI identification. Specifically, a ultra-group 
constrained structure detection algorithm is first designed to identify the 
parsimonious topology of the effective connectivity network, in which the weak 
derivatives of the observable data are considered. Second, based on the 
identified topology structure, an effective connectivity network is then 
constructed by using an ultra-orthogonal forward regression algorithm to 
minimize the shrinking effect of the group constraint-based method. Finally, the 
effective connectivity network is validated in MCI identification using an 
elastic multilayer perceptron classifier, which extracts lower to higher level 
information from initial input features and hence improves the classification 
performance. Relatively high classification accuracy is achieved by the proposed 
method when compared with the state-of-the-art classification methods. 
Furthermore, the network analysis results demonstrate that MCI patients suffer a 
rich club effect loss and have decreased connectivity among several brain 
regions. These findings suggest that the proposed method not only improves the 
classification performance but also successfully discovers critical 
disease-related neuroimaging biomarkers.

Brain MR Image Restoration Using an Automatic Trilateral Filter With GPU-Based 
Acceleration.

Chang HH, Li CY, Gallogly AH.

OBJECTIVE: Noise reduction in brain magnetic resonance (MR) images has been a 
challenging and demanding task. This study develops a new trilateral filter that 
aims to achieve robust and efficient image restoration.
METHODS: Extended from the bilateral filter, the proposed algorithm contains one 
additional intensity similarity funct-ion, which compensates for the unique 
characteristics of noise in brain MR images. An entropy function adaptive to 
intensity variations is introduced to regulate the contributions of the 
weighting components. To hasten the computation, parallel computing based on the 
graphics processing unit (GPU) strategy is explored with emphasis on memory 
allocations and thread distributions. To automate the filtration, image texture 
feature analysis associated with machine learning is investigated. Among the 98 
candidate features, the sequential forward floating selection scheme is employed 
to acquire the optimal texture features for regularization. Subsequently, a 
two-stage classifier that consists of support vector machines and artificial 
neural networks is established to predict the filter parameters for automation.
RESULTS: A speedup gain of 757 was reached to process an entire MR image volume 
of 256 × 256 × 256 pixels, which completed within 0.5 s. Automatic restoration 
results revealed high accuracy with an ensemble average relative error of 0.53 ± 
0.85% in terms of the peak signal-to-noise ratio.
CONCLUSION: This self-regulating trilateral filter outperformed many 
state-of-the-art noise reduction methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.
SIGNIFICANCE: We believe that this new image restoration algorithm is of 
potential in many brain MR image processing applications that require expedition 
and automation.

Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder and the most common 
type of dementia with a great prevalence in western countries. The diagnosis of 
AD and its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures 
including neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic 
(EEG) recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, 
analysis of the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great 
research interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper 
summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the 
correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated 
by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental 
studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms 
on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each 
experimental study are presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus 
on AD detection incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning 
techniques have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising 
conclusions for future studies are presented.

MOTIVATION: Heterogeneous diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifest a 
variety of phenotypes among populations. Early diagnosis and effective treatment 
offer cost benefits. Many studies on biochemical and imaging markers have shown 
potential promise in improving diagnosis, yet establishing quantitative 
diagnostic criteria for ancillary tests remains challenging.
RESULTS: We have developed a similarity-based approach that matches individuals 
to subjects with similar conditions. We modeled the disease with a Gaussian 
process, and tested the method in the Alzheimer's Disease Big Data DREAM 
Challenge. Ranked the highest among submitted methods, our diagnostic model 
predicted cognitive impairment scores in an independent dataset test with a 
correlation score of 0.573. It differentiated AD patients from control subjects 
with an area under the receiver operating curve of 0.920. Without knowing 
longitudinal information about subjects, the model predicted patients who are 
vulnerable to conversion from mild-cognitive impairment to AD through the 
similarity network. This diagnostic framework can be applied to other diseases 
with clinical heterogeneity, such as Parkinson's disease.

Recent studies demonstrated that beta oscillations are elicited during cognitive 
processes. To investigate their potential as electrophysiological markers of 
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), we recorded beta EEG activity during 
resting and during an omitted tone task in patients and healthy elderly. Thirty 
participants were enrolled (15 patients, 15 healthy controls). In particular, we 
investigated event-related spectral perturbation and intertrial coherence 
indices. Analyses showed that ( a) healthy elderly presented greater beta power 
at rest than patients with aMCI patients; ( b) during the task, healthy elderly 
were more accurate than aMCI patients and presented greater beta power than aMCI 
patients; ( c) both groups showed qualitatively similar spectral perturbation 
responses during the task, but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and ( 
d) aMCI patients presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderly 
during the task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differs 
from that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of task-related EEG 
activity extends evidences obtained during resting and suggests that during the 
prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is a reduced efficiency in 
information exchange by large-scale neural networks. The study for the first 
time shows the potential of task-related beta responses as early markers of aMCI 
impairments.

Brain atrophy quantification plays a fundamental role in neuroinformatics since 
it permits studying brain development and neurological disorders. However, the 
lack of a ground truth prevents testing the accuracy of longitudinal atrophy 
quantification methods. We propose a deep learning framework to generate 
longitudinal datasets by deforming T1-w brain magnetic resonance imaging scans 
as requested through segmentation maps. Our proposal incorporates a cascaded 
multi-path U-Net optimised with a multi-objective loss which allows its paths to 
generate different brain regions accurately. We provided our model with baseline 
scans and real follow-up segmentation maps from two longitudinal datasets, ADNI 
and OASIS, and observed that our framework could produce synthetic follow-up 
scans that matched the real ones (Total scans= 584; Median absolute error: 0.03 
± 0.02; Structural similarity index: 0.98 ± 0.02; Dice similarity coefficient: 
0.95 ± 0.02; Percentage of brain volume change: 0.24 ± 0.16; Jacobian 
integration: 1.13 ± 0.05). Compared to two relevant works generating brain 
lesions using U-Nets and conditional generative adversarial networks (CGAN), our 
proposal outperformed them significantly in most cases (p < 0.01), except in the 
delineation of brain edges where the CGAN took the lead (Jacobian integration: 
Ours - 1.13 ± 0.05 vs CGAN - 1.00 ± 0.02; p < 0.01). We examined whether changes 
induced with our framework were detected by FAST, SPM, SIENA, SIENAX, and the 
Jacobian integration method. We observed that induced and detected changes were 
highly correlated (Adj. R2 > 0.86). Our preliminary results on harmonised 
datasets showed the potential of our framework to be applied to various data 
collections without further adjustment.

Most current Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive disorders (MCI) studies 
use single data modality to make predictions such as AD stages. The fusion of 
multiple data modalities can provide a holistic view of AD staging analysis. 
Thus, we use deep learning (DL) to integrally analyze imaging (magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI)), genetic (single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)), and 
clinical test data to classify patients into AD, MCI, and controls (CN). We use 
stacked denoising auto-encoders to extract features from clinical and genetic 
data, and use 3D-convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for imaging data. We also 
develop a novel data interpretation method to identify top-performing features 
learned by the deep-models with clustering and perturbation analysis. Using 
Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset, we demonstrate that 
deep models outperform shallow models, including support vector machines, 
decision trees, random forests, and k-nearest neighbors. In addition, we 
demonstrate that integrating multi-modality data outperforms single modality 
models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and meanF1 scores. Our models 
have identified hippocampus, amygdala brain areas, and the Rey Auditory Verbal 
Learning Test (RAVLT) as top distinguished features, which are consistent with 
the known AD literature.

BACKGROUND: Generative adversarial networks (GAN) can produce images of improved 
quality but their ability to augment image-based classification is not fully 
explored. We evaluated if a modified GAN can learn from magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) scans of multiple magnetic field strengths to enhance Alzheimer's 
disease (AD) classification performance.
METHODS: T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 151 participants of the Alzheimer's 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who underwent both 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) and 
3-Tesla imaging at the same time were selected to construct a GAN model. This 
model was trained along with a three-dimensional fully convolutional network 
(FCN) using the generated images (3T*) as inputs to predict AD status. Quality 
of the generated images was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR), 
Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) and Natural Image 
Quality Evaluator (NIQE). Cases from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & 
Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 107) and the National Alzheimer's 
Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 565) were used for model validation.
RESULTS: The 3T*-based FCN classifier performed better than the FCN model 
trained using the 1.5-T scans. Specifically, the mean area under curve increased 
from 0.907 to 0.932, from 0.934 to 0.940, and from 0.870 to 0.907 on the ADNI 
test, AIBL, and NACC datasets, respectively. Additionally, we found that the 
mean quality of the generated (3T*) images was consistently higher than the 
1.5-T images, as measured using SNR, BRISQUE, and NIQE on the validation 
datasets.
CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates a proof of principle that GAN frameworks can 
be constructed to augment AD classification performance and improve image 
quality.

Models of Alzheimer's disease (AD) hypothesize stereotyped progression via white 
matter (WM) fiber connections, most likely via trans-synaptic transmission of 
toxic proteins along neuronal pathways. An important question in the field is 
whether and how organization of fiber pathways is affected by disease. It 
remains unknown whether fibers act as conduits of degenerative pathologies, or 
if they also degenerate with the gray matter network. This work uses graph 
theoretic modeling in a longitudinal design to investigate the impact of WM 
network organization on AD pathology spread. We hypothesize if altered WM 
network organization mediates disease progression, then a previously published 
network diffusion model will yield higher prediction accuracy using 
subject-specific connectomes in place of a healthy template connectome. 
Neuroimaging data in 124 subjects from ADNI were assessed. Graph topology 
metrics show preserved network organization in patients compared to controls. 
Using a published diffusion model, we further probe the effect of network 
alterations on degeneration spread in AD. We show that choice of connectome does 
not significantly impact the model's predictive ability. These results suggest 
that, despite measurable changes in integrity of specific fiber tracts, WM 
network organization in AD is preserved. Further, there is no difference in the 
mediation of putative pathology spread between healthy and AD-impaired networks. 
This conclusion is somewhat at variance with previous results, which report 
global topological disturbances in AD. Our data indicates the combined effect of 
edge thresholding, binarization, and inclusion of subcortical regions to network 
graphs may be responsible for previously reported effects.

AIMS: This study examined the interactive effect of physical fitness and 
Apolipoprotein e4 on intelligence and cortical networking in adolescents.
METHODS: Participants were middle school students consisting of 10 and 8 high- 
and low-fit e4 carriers (e4+), respectively, and 14 and 10 high- and low-fit 
non-carriers (e4-), respectively. Inter- and intra-hemispheric coherences were 
calculated to examine cortico-cortical communication during intelligence test.
RESULTS: Coherence in low-fit e4+ was lower than in high-fit e4+, while 
coherence in low-fit e4- was similar to or higher than in high-fit e4-.
CONCLUSION: the presence of the e4 allele can decrease neural networking 50-60 
years before Alzheimer's disease onset: however, physical fitness may compensate 
for the negative impact of genotype. Moreover, the beneficial effects of 
physical fitness may differ depending on functional states of the adolescent 
brain according to the presence of the e4 allele.

BACKGROUND: Effective detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still difficult 
in clinical practice. Therefore, establishment of AD detection model by means of 
machine learning is of great significance to assist AD diagnosis.
OBJECTIVE: To investigate and test a new detection model aiming to help doctors 
diagnose AD more accurately.
METHODS: Diffusion tensor images and the corresponding T1w images acquired from 
subjects (AD = 98, normal control (NC) = 100) are used to construct brain 
networks. Then, 9 types features (198×90×9 in total) are extracted from the 3D 
brain networks by a graph theory method. Features with low correction in both 
groups are selected through the Pearson correlation analysis. Finally, the 
selected features (198×33, 198×26, 198×30, 198×42, 198×36, 198×23, 198×29, 
198×14, 198×25) are separately used into train 3 machine learning classifier 
based detection models in which 60% of study subjects are used for training, 20% 
for validation and 20% for testing.
RESULTS: The best detection accuracy levels of 3 models are 90%, 98% and 90% 
with the corresponding sensitivity of 92%, 96%, and 72% and specificity of 88%, 
100% and 94% when using a random forest classifier trained with the Shortest 
Path Length (SPL) features (198×14), a support vector machine trained with the 
Degree Centrality features (198×33), and a convolution neural network trained 
with SPL features, respectively.
CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the new method and models not only 
improve the accuracy of detecting AD, but also avoid bias caused by the method 
of direct dimensionality reduction from high dimensional data.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: PSEN1-H163Y carriers, at the presymptomatic stage, 
have reduced 18 FDG-PET binding in the cerebrum of the brain (Scholl et al., 
Neurobiol Aging 32:1388-1399, 2011). This could imply dysfunctional energy 
metabolism in the brain. In this study, plasma of presymptomatic PSEN1 mutation 
carriers was analyzed to understand associated metabolic changes.
METHODS: We analyzed plasma from noncarriers (NC, n = 8) and presymptomatic 
PSEN1-H163Y mutation carriers (MC, n = 6) via untargeted metabolomics using gas 
and liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, which identified 1199 
metabolites. All the metabolites were compared between MC and NC using 
univariate analysis, as well as correlated with the ratio of Aβ1-42/A β 1-40 , 
using Spearman's correlation. Altered metabolites were subjected to Ingenuity 
Pathway Analysis (IPA).
RESULTS: Based on principal component analysis the plasma metabolite profiles 
were divided into dataset A and dataset B. In dataset A, when comparing between 
presymptomatic MC and NC, the levels of 79 different metabolites were altered. 
Out of 79, only 14 were annotated metabolites. In dataset B, 37 metabolites were 
significantly altered between presymptomatic MC and NC and nine metabolites were 
annotated. In both datasets, annotated metabolites represent amino acids, fatty 
acyls, bile acids, hexoses, purine nucleosides, carboxylic acids, and 
glycerophosphatidylcholine species. 1-docosapentaenoyl-GPC was positively 
correlated, uric acid and glucose were negatively correlated with the ratio of 
plasma Aβ1-42 /Aβ1-40 (P < 0.05).
INTERPRETATION: This study finds dysregulated metabolite classes, which are 
changed before the disease symptom onset. Also, it provides an opportunity to 
compare with sporadic Alzheimer's Disease. Observed findings in this study need 
to be validated in a larger and independent Familial Alzheimer's Disease (FAD) 
cohort.

Background: Hippocampus segmentation on magnetic resonance imaging is of key 
importance for the diagnosis, treatment decision and investigation of 
neuropsychiatric disorders. Automatic segmentation is an active research field, 
with many recent models using deep learning. Most current state-of-the art 
hippocampus segmentation methods train their methods on healthy or Alzheimer's 
disease patients from public datasets. This raises the question whether these 
methods are capable of recognizing the hippocampus on a different domain, that 
of epilepsy patients with hippocampus resection. New Method: In this paper we 
present a state-of-the-art, open source, ready-to-use, deep learning based 
hippocampus segmentation method. It uses an extended 2D multi-orientation 
approach, with automatic pre-processing and orientation alignment. The 
methodology was developed and validated using HarP, a public Alzheimer's disease 
hippocampus segmentation dataset. Results and Comparisons: We test this 
methodology alongside other recent deep learning methods, in two domains: The 
HarP test set and an in-house epilepsy dataset, containing hippocampus 
resections, named HCUnicamp. We show that our method, while trained only in 
HarP, surpasses others from the literature in both the HarP test set and 
HCUnicamp in Dice. Additionally, Results from training and testing in HCUnicamp 
volumes are also reported separately, alongside comparisons between training and 
testing in epilepsy and Alzheimer's data and vice versa. Conclusion: Although 
current state-of-the-art methods, including our own, achieve upwards of 0.9 Dice 
in HarP, all tested methods, including our own, produced false positives in 
HCUnicamp resection regions, showing that there is still room for improvement 
for hippocampus segmentation methods when resection is involved.

To diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD), neuroimaging methods such as magnetic 
resonance imaging have been employed. Recent progress in computer vision with 
deep learning (DL) has further inspired research focused on machine learning 
algorithms. However, a few limitations of these algorithms, such as the 
requirement for large number of training images and the necessity for powerful 
computers, still hinder the extensive usage of AD diagnosis based on machine 
learning. In addition, large number of training parameters and heavy computation 
make the DL systems difficult in integrating with mobile embedded devices, for 
example the mobile phones. For AD detection using DL, most of the current 
research solely focused on improving the classification performance, while few 
studies have been done to obtain a more compact model with less complexity and 
relatively high recognition accuracy. In order to solve this problem and improve 
the efficiency of the DL algorithm, a deep separable convolutional neural 
network model is proposed for AD classification in this paper. The depthwise 
separable convolution (DSC) is used in this work to replace the conventional 
convolution. Compared to the traditional neural networks, the parameters and 
computing cost of the proposed neural network are found greatly reduced. The 
parameters and computational costs of the proposed neural network are found to 
be significantly reduced compared with conventional neural networks. With its 
low power consumption, the proposed model is particularly suitable for embedding 
mobile devices. Experimental findings show that the DSC algorithm, based on the 
OASIS magnetic resonance imaging dataset, is very successful for AD detection. 
Moreover, transfer learning is employed in this work to improve model 
performance. Two trained models with complex networks, namely AlexNet and 
GoogLeNet, are used for transfer learning, with average classification rates of 
91.40%, 93.02% and a less power consumption.

An Explainable 3D Residual Self-Attention Deep Neural Network For Joint Atrophy 
Localization and Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis using Structural MRI.

Zhang X, Han L, Zhu W, Sun L, Zhang D.

Computer-aided early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal 
form mild cognitive impairment (MCI) based on structure Magnetic Resonance 
Imaging (sMRI) has provided a cost-effective and objective way for early 
prevention and treatment of disease progression, leading to improved patient 
care. In this work, we have proposed a novel computer-aided approach for early 
diagnosis of AD by introducing an explainable 3D Residual Attention Deep Neural 
Network (3D ResAttNet) for end-to-end learning from sMRI scans. Different from 
the existing approaches, the novelty of our approach is three-fold: 1) A 
Residual Self-Attention Deep Neural Network has been proposed to capture local, 
global and spatial information of MR images to improve diagnostic performance; 
2) An explanation method using Gradient-based Localization Class Activation 
mapping (Grad-CAM) has been introduced to improve the explainable of the 
proposed method; 3) This work has provided a full end-to-end learning solution 
for automated disease diagnosis. Our proposed 3D ResAttNet method has been 
evaluated on a large cohort of subjects from real datasets for two changeling 
classification tasks (i.e., Alzheimer's disease (AD) vs. Normal cohort (NC) and 
progressive MCI (pMCI) vs. stable MCI (sMCI)). The experimental results show 
that the proposed approach has a competitive advantage over the state-of-the-art 
models in terms of accuracy performance and generalizability. The explainable 
mechanism in our approach is able to identify and highlight the contribution of 
the important brain parts (e.g., hippocampus, lateral ventricle and most parts 
of the cortex) for transparent decisions.

OBJECTIVE: Our aim is to validate the process steps implemented by the French 
CATI platform to assess amyloid status, obtained from 18F-Florbetapir PET scans, 
in a cohort of 318 cognitively normal subjects participating in the 
INSIGHT-preAD study. Our objective was to develop a method with partial volume 
effect correction (PVEC) on untransformed PET images, using an automated 
pipeline ("RACHEL") adapted to large series of patients and including quality 
checks of results.
METHODS: We compared RACHEL using different options (with and without PVEC, 
different sets of regions of interest), to two other methods validated in the 
literature, referred as the "AVID" and "CAEN" methods. A standard uptake value 
ratio (SUVR) was obtained with the different methods for participants to another 
French study, IMAP, including 26 normal elderly controls (NEC), 11 patients with 
mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 16 patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). 
We determined two cutoffs for RACHEL method by linear correlation with the other 
methods and applied them to the INSIGHT-preAD subjects.
RESULTS: RACHEL including PVEC and a combination of the whole cerebellum and the 
pons as a reference region allowed the best discrimination between NEC and AD 
participants. A strong linear correlation was found between RACHEL and the other 
two methods and yielded the two cutoffs of 0.79 and 0.88. According to the more 
conservative threshold, 19.8% of the INSIGHT-preAD subjects would be considered 
amyloid positive, and 27.7% according to the more liberal threshold.
CONCLUSIONS: With our method, we clearly discriminated between NEC with negative 
amyloid status and patients with clinical AD. Using a linear correlation with 
other validated cutoffs, we could infer our own positivity thresholds and apply 
them to an independent population. This method might be useful to the community, 
especially when the optimal cutoff could not be obtained from a population of 
healthy young adults or from correlation with post-mortem results.

Alzheimer disease (AD) is mainly manifested as insidious onset, chronic 
progressive cognitive decline and non-cognitive neuropsychiatric symptoms, which 
seriously affects the quality of life of the elderly and causes a very large 
burden on society and families. This paper uses graph theory to analyze the 
constructed brain network, and extracts the node degree, node efficiency, and 
node betweenness centrality parameters of the two modal brain networks. The T 
test method is used to analyze the difference of graph theory parameters between 
normal people and AD patients, and brain regions with significant differences in 
graph theory parameters are selected as brain network features. By analyzing the 
calculation principles of the conventional convolutional layer and the depth 
separable convolution unit, the computational complexity of them is compared. 
The depth separable convolution unit decomposes the traditional convolution 
process into spatial convolution for feature extraction and point convolution 
for feature combination, which greatly reduces the number of multiplication and 
addition operations in the convolution process, while still being able to obtain 
comparisons. Aiming at the special convolution structure of the depth separable 
convolution unit, this paper proposes a channel pruning method based on the 
convolution structure and explains its pruning process. Multimodal neuroimaging 
can provide complete information for the quantification of Alzheimer's disease. 
This paper proposes a cascaded three-dimensional neural network framework based 
on single-modal and multi-modal images, using MRI and PET images to distinguish 
AD and MCI from normal samples. Multiple three-dimensional CNN networks are used 
to extract recognizable information in local image blocks. The high-level 
two-dimensional CNN network fuses multi-modal features and selects the features 
of discriminative regions to perform quantitative predictions on samples. The 
algorithm proposed in this paper can automatically extract and fuse the features 
of multi-modality and multi-regions layer by layer, and the visual analysis 
results show that the abnormally changed regions affected by Alzheimer's disease 
provide important information for clinical quantification.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, accounting 
for nearly 60% of all dementia cases. The occurrence of the disease has been 
increasing rapidly in recent years. Presently about 46.8 million individuals 
suffer from AD worldwide. The current absence of effective treatment to reverse 
or stop AD progression highlights the importance of disease prevention and early 
diagnosis. Brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely 
used for AD detection as it can display morphometric differences and cerebral 
structural changes. In this study, we built three machine learning-based MRI 
data classifiers to predict AD and infer the brain regions that contribute to 
disease development and progression. We then systematically compared the three 
distinct classifiers, which were constructed based on Support Vector Machine 
(SVM), 3D Very Deep Convolutional Network (VGGNet) and 3D Deep Residual Network 
(ResNet), respectively. To improve the performance of the deep learning 
classifiers, we applied a transfer learning strategy. The weights of a 
pre-trained model were transferred and adopted as the initial weights of our 
models. Transferring the learned features significantly reduced training time 
and increased network efficiency. The classification accuracy for AD subjects 
from elderly control subjects was 90%, 95%, and 95% for the SVM, VGGNet and 
ResNet classifiers, respectively. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping 
(Grad-CAM) was employed to show discriminative regions that contributed most to 
the AD classification by utilizing the learned spatial information of the 
3D-VGGNet and 3D-ResNet models. The resulted maps consistently highlighted 
several disease-associated brain regions, particularly the cerebellum which is a 
relatively neglected brain region in the present AD study. Overall, our 
comparisons suggested that the ResNet model provided the best classification 
performance as well as more accurate localization of disease-associated regions 
in the brain compared to the other two approaches.

PURPOSE: In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), identifying individuals at high 
risk for progressive cognitive deterioration can be useful for prognostication 
and intervention. This study quantitatively characterizes cognitive decline 
rates in MCI and tests whether volumetric data from baseline magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) can predict accelerated cognitive decline.
METHODS: The authors retrospectively examined Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging 
Initiative data to obtain serial Mini-Mental Status Exam (MMSE) scores, 
diagnoses, and the following baseline MRI volumes: total intracranial volume, 
whole-brain and ventricular volumes, and volumes of the hippocampus, entorhinal 
cortex, fusiform gyrus, and medial temporal lobe. Subjects with <24 months or <4 
measurements of MMSE data were excluded. Predictive modeling of fast cognitive 
decline (defined as >0.6/year) from baseline volumetric data was performed on 
subjects with MCI using a single hidden layer neural network.
RESULTS: Among 698 baseline MCI subjects, the median annual decline in the MMSE 
score was 1.3 for converters to dementia versus 0.11 for stable MCI (P<0.001). A 
0.6/year threshold captured dementia conversion with 82% accuracy (sensitivity 
79%, specificity 85%, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 
0.88). Regional volumes on baseline MRI predicted fast cognitive decline with a 
test accuracy of 71%.
DISCUSSION: An MMSE score decrease of >0.6/year is associated with 
MCI-to-dementia conversion and can be predicted from baseline MRI.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and 
markers of brain structure on cognitive decline in oldest-old individuals with 
initial normal cognition.
METHODS: We studied cognitive functioning in four domains at baseline and change 
over time in fifty-seven cognitively intact individuals from the EMIF-AD 90+ 
study. Predictors were Aβ status determined by [18 F]-flutemetamol PET 
(normal = Aβ - vs. abnormal = Aβ+), cortical thickness in 34 regions and 
hippocampal volume. Mediation analyses were performed to test whether effects of 
Aβ on cognitive decline were mediated by atrophy of specific anatomical brain 
areas.
RESULTS: Subjects had a mean age of 92.7 ± 2.9 years, of whom 19 (33%) were Aβ+. 
Compared to Aβ-, Aβ+ individuals showed steeper decline on memory 
(β ± SE = -0.26 ± 0.09), and processing speed (β ± SE = -0.18 ± 0.08) 
performance over 1.5 years (P < 0.05). Furthermore, medial and lateral temporal 
lobe atrophy was associated with steeper decline in memory and language across 
individuals. Mediation analyses revealed that part of the memory decline 
observed in Aβ+ individuals was mediated through parahippocampal atrophy.
INTERPRETATION: These results show that Aβ abnormality even in the oldest old 
with initially normal cognition is not part of normal aging, but is associated 
with a decline in cognitive functioning. Other pathologies may also contribute 
to decline in the oldest old as cortical thickness predicted cognitive decline 
similarly in individuals with and without Aβ pathology.

BACKGROUND: Advanced machine learning methods can aid in the identification of 
dementia risk using neuroimaging-derived features including FDG-PET. However, to 
enable the translation of these methods and test their usefulness in clinical 
practice, it is crucial to conduct independent validation on real clinical 
samples, which has yet to be properly delineated in the current literature.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, we present our efforts to enable such clinical 
translational through the evaluation and comparison of two machine-learning 
methods for discrimination between dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and 
Non-DAT controls.
METHODS: FDG-PET-based dementia scores were generated on an independent clinical 
sample whose clinical diagnosis was blinded to the algorithm designers. A 
feature-engineered approach (multi-kernel probability classifier) and a 
non-feature-engineered approach (3D convolutional neural network) were analyzed. 
Both classifiers were pre-trained on cognitively normal subjects as well as 
subjects with DAT. These two methods provided a probabilistic dementia score for 
this previously unseen clinical data. Performance of the algorithms were 
compared against ground-truth dementia rating assessed by experienced nuclear 
physicians.
RESULTS: Blinded clinical evaluation on both classifiers showed good separation 
between the cognitively normal subjects and the patients diagnosed with DAT. The 
non-feature-engineered dementia score showed higher sensitivity among subjects 
whose diagnosis was in agreement between the machine-learning models, while the 
feature-engineered approach showed higher specificity in non-consensus cases.
CONCLUSION: In this study, we demonstrated blinded evaluation using data from an 
independent clinical sample for assessing the performance in DAT classification 
models in a clinical setting. Our results showed good generalizability for two 
machine-learning approaches, marking an important step for the translation of 
pre-trained machine-learning models into clinical practice.

Growing evidence supports a link between locus of control and memory in older 
adults. Control beliefs may directly predict larger hippocampal volume (i.e., 
brain maintenance). Alternatively, control beliefs may be associated with 
smaller hippocampal volume at any given level of memory (i.e., cognitive 
reserve). Multivariable regression analyses examined associations between verbal 
episodic memory, locus of control and hippocampal volume among 236 non-demented 
older adults in the community-based Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging 
Project. Control beliefs were negatively associated with hippocampal volume when 
controlling for memory performance, indicating that individuals with stronger 
control beliefs were able to maintain memory function in the face of lower 
hippocampal volume. Subsequent exploratory models stratified by race/ethnicity 
indicated that this association was more prominent among racial/ethnic 
minorities (particularly Caribbean Hispanic older adults) than among 
non-Hispanic White older adults. Control beliefs were not associated with 
hippocampal volume before memory was taken into account. Results are consistent 
with the view that control beliefs facilitate the maintenance of memory function 
despite hippocampal volume loss. Results are not consistent with the view that 
locus of control contributes to brain maintenance. Culturally-appropriate 
interventions are needed to test whether strengthening control beliefs provides 
cognitive resistance to neuropathology.

Purpose and aim: Detection of brain tumors plays a critical role in the 
treatment of patients. Before any treatment, tumor segmentation is crucial to 
protect healthy tissues during treatment and to destroy tumor cells. Tumor 
segmentation involves the detection, precise identification, and separation of 
tumor tissues. In this paper, we provide a deep learning method for the 
segmentation of brain tumors. Material and methods: In this article, we used a 
convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment tumors in seven types of brain 
disease consisting of Glioma, Meningioma, Alzheimer's, Alzheimer's plus, Pick, 
Sarcoma, and Huntington. First, we used the feature-reduction-based method 
robust principal component analysis to find tumor location and spot in a dataset 
of Harvard Medical School. Then we present an architecture of the CNN method to 
detect brain tumors. Results: Results are depicted based on the probability of 
tumor location in magnetic resonance images. Results show that the presented 
method provides high accuracy (96%), sensitivity (99.9%), and dice index (91%) 
regarding other investigations. Conclusion: The provided unsupervised method for 
tumor clustering and proposed supervised architecture can be potential methods 
for medical uses.

It is challenging to compare amyloid PET images obtained with different 
radiotracers. Here, we introduce a new approach to improve the 
interchangeability of amyloid PET acquired with different radiotracers through 
image-level translation. Deep generative networks were developed using unpaired 
PET datasets, consisting of 203 [11C]PIB and 850 [18F]florbetapir brain PET 
images. Using 15 paired PET datasets, the standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) 
values obtained from pseudo-PIB or pseudo-florbetapir PET images translated 
using the generative networks was compared to those obtained from the original 
images. The generated amyloid PET images showed similar distribution patterns 
with original amyloid PET of different radiotracers. The SUVR obtained from the 
original [18F]florbetapir PET was lower than those obtained from the original 
[11C]PIB PET. The translated amyloid PET images reduced the difference in SUVR. 
The SUVR obtained from the pseudo-PIB PET images generated from [18F]florbetapir 
PET showed a good agreement with those of the original PIB PET (ICC = 0.87 for 
global SUVR). The SUVR obtained from the pseudo-florbetapir PET also showed a 
good agreement with those of the original [18F]florbetapir PET (ICC = 0.85 for 
global SUVR). The ICC values between the original and generated PET images were 
higher than those between original [11C]PIB and [18F]florbetapir images 
(ICC = 0.65 for global SUVR). Our approach provides the image-level translation 
of amyloid PET images obtained using different radiotracers. It may facilitate 
the clinical studies designed with variable amyloid PET images due to long-term 
clinical follow-up as well as multicenter trials by enabling the translation of 
different types of amyloid PET.

Age-Net: An MRI-Based Iterative Framework for Brain Biological Age Estimation.

Armanious K, Abdulatif S, Shi W, Salian S, Kustner T, Weiskopf D, Hepp T, 
Gatidis S, Yang B.

The concept of biological age (BA) - although important in clinical practice - 
is hard to grasp mainly due to the lack of a clearly defined reference standard. 
For specific applications, especially in pediatrics, medical image data are used 
for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond this young age group, BA 
estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging 
indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various 
organ systems may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and 
genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body assessment of the BA does not reflect the 
deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end, we propose a new 
imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study 
we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age 
(CA) estimation framework using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We 
quantitatively assess the performance of this framework in comparison to 
existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore, we expand upon 
Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate 
atypical-aging patients (BA ≉ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that 
the remaining population should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the 
proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance image (MRI) dataset 
containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different 
dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and 
the expected cognitive deterioration in Alzheimer's patients. A statistical and 
visualization-based analysis has provided evidence regarding the potential and 
current challenges of the proposed methodology.

Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is considered 
essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may involve detecting 
structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of 
asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by 
computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its 
stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the 
paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity 
hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of 
structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The 
experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with 
normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. 
Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested 
are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% 
for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost 
alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to 
other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain 
asymmetries.

PURPOSE: This study was to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN) model 
with a residual learning framework to predict the full-time 18F-florbetaben 
(18F-FBB) PET/CT images from corresponding short-time scans.
METHODS: In this retrospective study, we enrolled 22 cognitively normal 
subjects, 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 42 patients with 
Alzheimer disease. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET/CT data were acquired and 
reconstructed as the ground-truth images. The short-time scans were made in 
either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. The CNN with a residual learning framework was 
implemented to predict the ground-truth images of 18F-FBB PET/CT using 
short-time scans with either a single-slice or a 3-slice input layer. Model 
performance was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative analyses. 
Additionally, we quantified the amyloid load in the ground-truth and predicted 
images using the SUV ratio.
RESULTS: On quantitative analyses, with increasing scan time, the normalized 
root-mean-squared error and the SUV ratio differences between predicted and 
ground-truth images gradually decreased, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio 
increased. On qualitative analysis, the predicted images from the 3-slice CNN 
model showed better image quality than those from the single-slice model. The 
3-slice CNN model with a short-time scan of at least 2 minutes achieved 
comparable, quantitative prediction of full-time 18F-FBB PET/CT images, with 
adequate to excellent image quality.
CONCLUSIONS: The 3-slice CNN model with a residual learning framework is 
promising for the prediction of full-time 18F-FBB PET/CT images from short-time 
scans.

BACKGROUND: Our goal was to investigate the role of physical exercise to protect 
brain health as we age, including the potential to mitigate Alzheimer's-related 
pathology. We assessed the effect of 52 weeks of a supervised aerobic exercise 
program on amyloid accumulation, cognitive performance, and brain volume in 
cognitively normal older adults with elevated and sub-threshold levels of 
cerebral amyloid as measured by amyloid PET imaging.
METHODS AND FINDINGS: This 52-week randomized controlled trial compared the 
effects of 150 minutes per week of aerobic exercise vs. education control 
intervention. A total of 117 underactive older adults (mean age 72.9 [7.7]) 
without evidence of cognitive impairment, with elevated (n = 79) or subthreshold 
(n = 38) levels of cerebral amyloid were randomized, and 110 participants 
completed the study. Exercise was conducted with supervision and monitoring by 
trained exercise specialists. We conducted 18F-AV45 PET imaging of cerebral 
amyloid and anatomical MRI for whole brain and hippocampal volume at baseline 
and Week 52 follow-up to index brain health. Neuropsychological tests were 
conducted at baseline, Week 26, and Week 52 to assess executive function, verbal 
memory, and visuospatial cognitive domains. Cardiorespiratory fitness testing 
was performed at baseline and Week 52 to assess response to exercise. The 
aerobic exercise group significantly improved cardiorespiratory fitness (11% vs. 
1% in the control group) but there were no differences in change measures of 
amyloid, brain volume, or cognitive performance compared to control.
CONCLUSIONS: Aerobic exercise was not associated with reduced amyloid 
accumulation in cognitively normal older adults with cerebral amyloid. In spite 
of strong systemic cardiorespiratory effects of the intervention, the observed 
lack of cognitive or brain structure benefits suggests brain benefits of 
exercise reported in other studies are likely to be related to non-amyloid 
effects.

Lacsogram: a New EEG Tool to Diagnose Alzheimer's Disease.

Rodrigues PM, Bispo BC, Garrett C, Alves D, Teixeira JP, Freitas D.

This work proposes the application of a new electroencephalogram (EEG) signal 
processing tool - the lacsogram - to characterize the Alzheimer's disease (AD) 
activity and to assist on its diagnosis at different stages: Mild Cognitive 
Impairment (MCI), Mild and Moderate AD (ADM) and Advanced AD (ADA). Statistical 
analyzes are performed to lacstral distances between conventional EEG subbands 
to find measures capable of discriminating AD in all stages and characterizing 
the AD activity in each electrode. Cepstral distances are used for comparison. 
Comparing all AD stages and Controls (C), the most important significances are 
the lacstral distances between subbands and (p=0.0014<0.05). The topographic 
maps show significant differences in parietal, temporal and frontal regions as 
AD progresses. Machine learning models with a leave-one-out cross-validation 
process are applied to lacstral/cepstral distances to develop an automatic 
method for diagnosing AD. The following classification accuracies are obtained 
with an artificial neural network: 95.55% for All vs All, 98.06% for C vs MCI, 
95.99% for C vs ADM, 93.85% for MCI vs ADM-ADA. In C vs MCI, C vs ADM and MCI vs 
ADM-ADA, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-art methods by 5%, 1%, and 
2%, respectively. In All vs All, it outperforms the state-of-art EEG and non-EEG 
methods by 6% and 2%, respectively. These results indicate that the proposed 
method represents an improvement in diagnosing AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease 
characterized by memory impairment. Previous studies have largely focused on 
alterations of static brain activity occurring in patients with AD. Few studies 
to date have explored the characteristics of dynamic brain activity in cognitive 
impairment, and their predictive ability in AD patients.
METHODS: One hundred and eleven AD patients, 29 MCI patients, and 73 healthy 
controls (HC) were recruited. The dynamic amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation 
(dALFF) and the dynamic fraction amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (dfALFF) 
were used to assess the temporal variability of local brain activity in patients 
with AD or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Pearson's correlation coefficients 
were calculated between the metrics and subjects' behavioral scores.
RESULTS: The results of analysis of variance indicated that the AD, MCI, and HC 
groups showed significant variability of dALFF in the cerebellar posterior and 
middle temporal lobes. In AD patients, these brain regions had high dALFF 
variability. Significant dfALFF variability was found between the three groups 
in the left calcarine cortex and white matter. The AD group showed lower dfALFF 
than the MCI group in the left calcarine cortex.
CONCLUSIONS: Compared to HC, AD patients were found to have increased dALFF 
variability in the cerebellar posterior and temporal lobes. This abnormal 
pattern may diminish the capacity of the cerebellum and temporal lobes to 
participate in the cerebrocerebellar circuits and default mode network (DMN), 
which regulate cognition and emotion in AD. The findings above indicate that the 
analysis of dALFF and dfALFF based on functional magnetic resonance imaging data 
may give a new insight into the neurophysiological mechanisms of AD.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non-invasive method that helps 
to analyze brain function based on BOLD signal fluctuations. Functional 
Connectivity (FC) catches the transient relationship between various brain 
regions usually measured by correlation analysis. The elements of the 
correlation matrix are between -1 to 1. Some of them are very small values 
usually related to weak and spurious correlations due to noises and artifacts. 
They can not be concluded as real strong correlations between brain regions and 
their existence could make a misconception and leads to fake results. It is 
crucial to make a conclusion based on reliable and informative correlations. In 
order to eliminate weak correlations, thresholding is a common method. In this 
routine, by adjusting a threshold the values below the threshold turn to zero 
and the rest remains. In this paper, in addition to thresholding, two other 
methods including spectral sparsification based on Effective Resistance (ER) and 
autoencoders are investigated for sparsing the correlation matrices. 
Autoencoders are based on deep learning neural networks and ER considers the 
network as a resistive circuit. The fMRI data of the study correspond to 
Alzheimer's patients and control subjects. Graph global measures are calculated 
and a non-parametric permutation test is reported. Results show that the 
autoencoder and spectral sparsification achieved more distinctive brain graphs 
between healthy and AD subjects. Also, more graph global features were 
significantly different from these two methods due to better elimination of weak 
correlations and preserve more informative ones. Regardless of the 
sparsification method features including average strength, clustering, local 
efficiency, modularity, and transitivity are significantly different 
(P-value=0.05). On the other hand, the measures radius, diameter, and 
eccentricity showed no significant differences in none of the methods. In 
addition, according to three different methods, the brain regions show fragile 
and solid FCs are determined.

OBJECTIVE: The present work was undertaken to study the genetic contribution to 
the start of Alzheimer's disease (AD) with amyloid and tau biomarkers in 
cognitively intact older identical twins.
METHODS: We studied in 96 monozygotic twin-pairs relationships between 
amyloid-beta (Aβ) aggregation as measured by the Aβ1-42/1-40 ratio in 
cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 
194), and CSF markers for Aβ production (beta-secretase 1, Aβ1-40, and Aβ1-38) 
and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating 
equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, 
and apolipoprotein E ε4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative 
contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological 
processes.
RESULTS: Twenty-seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 
twin-pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin-pairs, Aβ 
production markers and total-tau (t-tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 
0.73-0.86, all p < 0.0001), and Aβ aggregation markers and 
181-phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 
0.50-0.64, all p < 0.0001). Cross-twin cross-trait analysis showed that Aβ1-38 
in one twin correlated with Aβ1-42/1-40 ratios, and t-tau and p-tau levels in 
their cotwins (r range = -0.28 to 0.58, all p < .007). Within-pair differences 
in Aβ production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 
0.49-0.61, all p < 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that Aβ production 
and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD.
INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental 
background contributes to both Aβ and tau increases, suggesting that modulation 
of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD 
pathophysiological processes. ANN NEUROL 2021;89:987-1000.

OBJECTIVE: A predictive model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) was established based 
on brain surface meshes and geometric deep learning, and its performance was 
evaluated.
METHODS: Seventy-six clinically diagnosed AD patients and 83 healthy older 
adults were enrolled and randomly assigned to the training set and the test set 
according to a 4-to-1 ratio. Brain surface mesh was constructed from 3-D 
T1-weighted high-resolution structural MR volumes of each participant. After 
applying a series of simplification to the surface meshes, the training set was 
fed into the geometric deep neural network for training. The performance of the 
prediction model was evaluated with the test set, and the evaluation metrics 
included accuracy, sensitivity and specificity.
RESULTS: The prediction model trained on the right brain surface meshes with 6 
000 faces achieved the best performance, with accuracy reaching 93.8%, 
sensitivity, 91.7%, and specificity, 94.1%. The evolution of the brain surface 
meshes during convolution and pooling revealed that AD patients had diffuse 
brain tissue loss compared with healthy older adults.
CONCLUSION: Morphological brain analysis based on mesh data and geometric deep 
learning has great potential in the differential diagnosis of AD.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-progressive neurodegenerative 
disorder that affects cognitive function. There have been several functional 
connectivity (FC) strengths; however, FC density needs more development in AD. 
Therefore, this study wanted to determine the alternations in resting-state 
functional connectivity density (FCD) induced by Alzheimer's and mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI).
METHODS: One hundred and eleven AD patients, 29 MCI patients, and 73 healthy 
controls (age- and sex-matched) were recruited and assessed using resting-state 
functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning. The ultra-fast graph 
theory called FCD mapping was used to calculate the voxel-wise short- and 
long-range FCD values of the brain. We performed voxel-based between-group 
comparisons of FCD values to show the cerebral regions with significant FCD 
alterations. We performed Pearson's correlation analyses between aberrant 
functional connectivity densities and several clinical variables with adjustment 
for age and sex.
RESULTS: Patients with cognition decline showed significantly abnormal 
long-range FCD in the cerebellum crus I, right insula, left inferior frontal 
gyrus, left superior frontal gyrus, left inferior frontal gyrus, and right 
middle frontal gyrus. The short-range FCD changed in the cerebellum crus I, left 
inferior frontal gyrus, left superior occipital gyrus, and right middle frontal 
gyrus. The long- and short-range functional connectivity in the left inferior 
frontal gyrus was positively correlated with Mini-mental State Examination 
(MMSE) scores.
CONCLUSIONS: FCD in the identified regions reflects mechanism and compensation

and MCI and supply a neuroimaging marker for AD and MCI.

Multi-Task Weakly-Supervised Attention Network for Dementia Status Estimation 
With Structural MRI.

Lian C, Liu M, Wang L, Shen D.

Accurate prediction of clinical scores (of neuropsychological tests) based on 
noninvasive structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) helps understand the 
pathological stage of dementia (e.g., Alzheimer's disease (AD)) and forecast its 
progression. Existing machine/deep learning approaches typically preselect 
dementia-sensitive brain locations for MRI feature extraction and model 
construction, potentially leading to undesired heterogeneity between different 
stages and degraded prediction performance. Besides, these methods usually rely 
on prior anatomical knowledge (e.g., brain atlas) and time-consuming nonlinear 
registration for the preselection of brain locations, thereby ignoring 
individual-specific structural changes during dementia progression because all 
subjects share the same preselected brain regions. In this article, we propose a 
multi-task weakly-supervised attention network (MWAN) for the joint regression 
of multiple clinical scores from baseline MRI scans. Three sequential components 
are included in MWAN: 1) a backbone fully convolutional network for extracting 
MRI features; 2) a weakly supervised dementia attention block for automatically 
identifying subject-specific discriminative brain locations; and 3) an 
attention-aware multitask regression block for jointly predicting multiple 
clinical scores. The proposed MWAN is an end-to-end and fully trainable deep 
learning model in which dementia-aware holistic feature learning and multitask 
regression model construction are integrated into a unified framework. Our MWAN 
method was evaluated on two public AD data sets for estimating clinical scores 
of mini-mental state examination (MMSE), clinical dementia rating sum of boxes 
(CDRSB), and AD assessment scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog). Quantitative 
experimental results demonstrate that our method produces superior regression 
performance compared with state-of-the-art methods. Importantly, qualitative 
results indicate that the dementia-sensitive brain locations automatically 
identified by our MWAN method well retain individual specificities and are 
biologically meaningful.

PURPOSE: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible 
neurodegenerative disease. In recent years, machine learning methods have been 
widely used on analysis of neuroimage for quantitative evaluation and 
computer-aided diagnosis of AD or prediction on the conversion from mild 
cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. In this study, we aimed to develop a new deep 
learning method to detect or predict AD in an efficient way.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We proposed a densely connected convolution neural 
network with connection-wise attention mechanism to learn the multi-level 
features of brain MR images for AD classification. We used the densely connected 
neural network to extract multi-scale features from pre-processed images, and 
connection-wise attention mechanism was applied to combine connections among 
features from different layers to hierarchically transform the MR images into 
more compact high-level features. Furthermore, we extended the convolution 
operation to 3D to capture the spatial information of MRI. The features 
extracted from each 3D convolution layer were integrated with features from all 
preceding layers with different attention, and were finally used for 
classification. Our method was evaluated on the baseline MRI of 968 subjects 
from ADNI database to discriminate (1) AD versus healthy subjects, (2) MCI 
converters versus healthy subjects, and (3) MCI converters versus 
non-converters.
RESULTS: The proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy for distinguishing AD 
patients from healthy control, 87.82% for MCI converters against healthy 
control, and 78.79% for MCI converters against non-converters. Compared with 
some neural networks and methods reported in recent studies, the classification 
performance of our proposed algorithm was among the top ranks and improved in 
discriminating MCI subjects who were in high risks of conversion to AD.
CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning techniques provide a powerful tool to explore minute 
but intricate characteristics in MR images which may facilitate early diagnosis 
and prediction of AD.

OBJECTIVE: To determine differences in clinical presentation and disease 
progression between patients with dementia due to AD with visually normal and 
abnormal EEG recordings. We hypothesized that patients with normal 
electroencephalographs (EEGs) are a representation of the heterogeneity of AD. 
We expected this group to have a phenotype with relatively predominant 
hippocampal atrophy, memory deficits, and a slower disease progression.
METHODS: Patients were included based on diagnosis of dementia due to AD, 
positive amyloid and tau cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, and the 
availability of EEG recordings. Patients were categorized in groups of normal 
(N = 208) and abnormal (N = 336) EEG recordings based on visual assessment by 
experienced neurophysiologists. At baseline demographics, cognitive, MRI, and 
CSF measures were compared between groups. Cognitive data from follow-up visits 
were assessed by linear mixed-effects models (LMMs), and corrected for baseline 
value, sex, age, and educational level, to compare cognitive deterioration over 
time between groups.
RESULTS: About 1 in 4.5 patients with AD dementia had a visually normal EEG and 
this group showed better overall cognitive performance compared to the abnormal 
group, where memory was the most prominent affected domain. The normal group 
showed less global and parietal but similar medial temporal atrophy. Follow-up 
data showed a slower deterioration on all tested cognitive domains in the normal 
EEG group.
INTERPRETATION: Patients with dementia due to AD and visually normal EEG 
recordings showed a milder clinical presentation and had a milder disease 
progression compared to patients with an abnormal EEG. These results provide 
evidence of clinical and biological heterogeneity within AD dementia.

In 2008, we published the first set of guidelines for standardizing research in 
autophagy. Since then, this topic has received increasing attention, and many 
scientists have entered the field. Our knowledge base and relevant new 
technologies have also been expanding. Thus, it is important to formulate on a 
regular basis updated guidelines for monitoring autophagy in different 
organisms. Despite numerous reviews, there continues to be confusion regarding 
acceptable methods to evaluate autophagy, especially in multicellular 
eukaryotes. Here, we present a set of guidelines for investigators to select and 
interpret methods to examine autophagy and related processes, and for reviewers 
to provide realistic and reasonable critiques of reports that are focused on 
these processes. These guidelines are not meant to be a dogmatic set of rules, 
because the appropriateness of any assay largely depends on the question being 
asked and the system being used. Moreover, no individual assay is perfect for 
every situation, calling for the use of multiple techniques to properly monitor 
autophagy in each experimental setting. Finally, several core components of the 
autophagy machinery have been implicated in distinct autophagic processes 
(canonical and noncanonical autophagy), implying that genetic approaches to 
block autophagy should rely on targeting two or more autophagy-related genes 
that ideally participate in distinct steps of the pathway. Along similar lines, 
because multiple proteins involved in autophagy also regulate other cellular 
pathways including apoptosis, not all of them can be used as a specific marker 
for bona fide autophagic responses. Here, we critically discuss current methods 
of assessing autophagy and the information they can, or cannot, provide. Our 
ultimate goal is to encourage intellectual and technical innovation in the 
field.

Tensorizing GAN With High-Order Pooling for Alzheimer's Disease Assessment.

Yu W, Lei B, Ng MK, Cheung AC, Shen Y, Wang S.

It is of great significance to apply deep learning for the early diagnosis of 
Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this work, a novel tensorizing GAN with high-order 
pooling is proposed to assess mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. By 
tensorizing a three-player cooperative game-based framework, the proposed model 
can benefit from the structural information of the brain. By incorporating the 
high-order pooling scheme into the classifier, the proposed model can make full 
use of the second-order statistics of holistic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). 
To the best of our knowledge, the proposed Tensor-train, High-order pooling and 
Semisupervised learning-based GAN (THS-GAN) is the first work to deal with 
classification on MR images for AD diagnosis. Extensive experimental results on 
Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) data set are reported to 
demonstrate that the proposed THS-GAN achieves superior performance compared 
with existing methods, and to show that both tensor-train and high-order pooling 
can enhance classification performance. The visualization of generated samples 
also shows that the proposed model can generate plausible samples for 
semisupervised learning purpose.

It is known that insulin-degrading-enzyme (IDE) plays a crucial role in the 
clearance of Alzheimer's amyloid-β (Aβ). The cysteine-free IDE mutant 
(cf-E111Q-IDE) is catalytically inactive against insulin, but its effect on Aβ 
degradation is unknown that would help in the allosteric modulation of the 
enzyme activity. Herein, the degradation of Aβ(1-40) by cf-E111Q-IDE via a 
non-chaperone mechanism is demonstrated by NMR and LC-MS, and the aggregation of 
fragmented peptides is characterized using fluorescence and electron microscopy. 
cf-E111Q-IDE presented a reduced effect on the aggregation kinetics of Aβ(1-40) 
when compared with the wild-type IDE. Whereas LC-MS and diffusion ordered NMR 
spectroscopy revealed the generation of Aβ fragments by both wild-type and 
cf-E111Q-IDE. The aggregation propensities and the difference in the 
morphological phenotype of the full-length Aβ(1-40) and its fragments are 
explained using multi-microseconds molecular dynamics simulations. Notably, our 
results reveal that zinc binding to Aβ(1-40) inactivates cf-E111Q-IDE's 
catalytic function, whereas zinc removal restores its function as evidenced from 
high-speed AFM, electron microscopy, chromatography, and NMR results. These 
findings emphasize the catalytic role of cf-E111Q-IDE on Aβ degradation and urge 
the development of zinc chelators as an alternative therapeutic strategy that 
switches on/off IDE's function.

BACKGROUND: To study the efficacy of tandospirone citrate in treating 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with anxiety.
METHODS: Thirty mild-to-moderate AD patients with anxiety symptoms were randomly 
divided into a monotherapy group (donepezil) and a combination therapy group 
(donepezil and tandospirone). The treatment lasted for 12 weeks. Drug efficacy 
was regularly assessed using psychological assessment scales and quantitative 
pharmaco-electroencephalogram (QPEEG) power spectral analysis.
RESULTS: After 12 weeks of treatment, the mean Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA) 
score and mean Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) score of the combination therapy 
group were 5.13±4.18 and 4.2±5.0, respectively, which was significantly lower 
compared to baseline and the monotherapy group (all P<0.05). The mean attention 
score on the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-Cog) 
was 0.07±0.26 for the combination group, which was significantly lower than that 
of the monotherapy group (P<0.05). QPEEG revealed that the power values of the δ 
wave in the right prefrontal lobe, left middle temporal lobe and right posterior 
temporal lobe decreased in the combination therapy group but not in the 
monotherapy group. Similarly, the power values of the α2 wave in the right 
parietal, right posterior temporal and left middle temporal lobes, and the β1 
wave power values of left middle temporal and left posterior temporal lobes were 
also significantly decreased in the combination therapy group, but not in the 
monotherapy group.
CONCLUSIONS: Tandospirone citrate can significantly improve anxiety symptoms and 
attention in patients with mild to moderate AD. QPEEG examination might provide 
a objective way for the efficacy of the tandospirone in anxiety symptoms of the 
patients with Alzheimer's disease.

OBJECTIVE: To assess associations between head injury (HI) with loss of 
consciousness (LOC), ageing and markers of later-life cerebral pathology; and to 
explore whether those effects may help explain subtle cognitive deficits in 
dementia-free individuals.
METHODS: Participants (n = 502, age = 69-71) from the 1946 British Birth Cohort 
underwent cognitive testing (subtests of Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive 
Composite), 18 F-florbetapir Aβ-PET and MR imaging. Measures include Aβ-PET 
status, brain, hippocampal and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volumes, normal 
appearing white matter (NAWM) microstructure, Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related 
cortical thickness, and serum neurofilament light chain (NFL). LOC HI metrics 
include HI occurring: (i) >15 years prior to the scan (ii) anytime up to age 71.
RESULTS: Compared to those with no evidence of an LOC HI, only those reporting 
an LOC HI>15 years prior (16%, n = 80) performed worse on cognitive tests at age 
69-71, taking into account premorbid cognition, particularly on the digit-symbol 
substitution test (DSST). Smaller brain volume (BV) and adverse NAWM 
microstructural integrity explained 30% and 16% of the relationship between HI 
and DSST, respectively. We found no evidence that LOC HI was associated with Aβ 
load, hippocampal volume, WMH volume, AD-related cortical thickness or NFL (all 
p > 0.01).
INTERPRETATION: Having a LOC HI aged 50's and younger was linked with lower 
later-life cognitive function at age ~70 than expected. This may reflect a 
damaging but small impact of HI; explained in part by smaller BV and different 
microstructure pathways but not via pathology related to AD (amyloid, 
hippocampal volume, AD cortical thickness) or ongoing neurodegeneration (serum 
NFL).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been widely used in assessing development 
of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by providing structural information of 
disease-associated regions (e.g. atrophic regions). In this paper, we propose a 
light-weight cross-view hierarchical fusion network (CvHF-net), consisting of 
local patch and global subject subnets, for joint localization and 
identification of the discriminative local patches and regions in the whole 
brain MRI, upon which feature representations are then jointly learned and fused 
to construct hierarchical classification models for AD diagnosis. Firstly, based 
on the extracted class-discriminative 3D patches, we employ the local patch 
subnets to utilize multiple 2D views to represent 3D patches by using an 
attention-aware hierarchical fusion structure in a divide-and-conquer manner. 
Since different local patches are with various abilities in AD identification, 
the global subject subnet is developed to bias the allocation of available 
resources towards the most informative parts among these local patches to obtain 
global information for AD identification. Besides, an instance declined pruning 
algorithm is embedded in the CvHF-net for adaptively selecting most discriminant 
patches in a task-driven manner. The proposed method was evaluated on the AD 
Neuroimaging Initiative dataset and the experimental results show that our 
proposed method can achieve good performance on AD diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: A comprehensive visual rating scale (CVRS) using brain magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) was previously developed to evaluate structural changes 
in the brains of older patients. This study investigated the usefulness of the 
CVRS in predicting dementia with Alzheimer disease (AD) in patients with 
prodromal AD.
METHODS: We included 189 patients with prodromal AD with available data from the 
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study. We evaluated all patients 
using CVRS and assessed their progression to AD dementia over 3 years of 
longitudinal follow-up. Survival analysis was performed using the Cox 
proportional hazards model to analyze the hazard ratios of the CVRS for 
progression to AD dementia.
RESULTS: Among 189 patients with prodromal AD, 61 (32.3%) progressed to 
dementia. The mean baseline CVRS scores differed significantly between the 
stable and progressive groups (9.9±5.1 vs. 12.4±4.9; p=0.002). An initial high 
CVRS score was an independent risk factor for the progression to AD dementia 
(hazard ratio=1.110; 95% confidence interval, 1.043-1.182).
CONCLUSION: The baseline CVRS score predicted the progression to dementia in 
patients with prodromal AD, indicating its independent association with 
longitudinal cognitive decline.

Primary age-related tauopathy (PART) is a neurodegenerative entity defined as 
neurofibrillary degeneration generally restricted to the medial temporal region 
(Braak stage I-IV) with complete or near absence of diffuse and neuritic 
plaques. Symptoms range in severity but are generally milder and later in onset 
than in Alzheimer disease (AD). Recently, an early predilection for 
neurofibrillary degeneration in the hippocampal CA2 subregion has been 
demonstrated in PART, whereas AD neuropathologic change (ADNC) typically 
displays relative sparing of CA2 until later stages. In this study, we utilized 
a semiquantitative scoring system to evaluate asymmetry of neurofibrillary 
degeneration between left and right hippocampi in 67 PART cases and 17 ADNC 
cases. 49% of PART cases demonstrated asymmetric findings in at least one 
hippocampal subregion, and 79% of the asymmetric cases displayed some degree of 
CA2 asymmetry. Additionally, 19% of cases revealed a difference in Braak score 
between the right and left hippocampi. There was a significant difference in CA2 
neurofibrillary degeneration (p = 0.0006) and CA2/CA1 ratio (p < 0.0001) when 
comparing the contralateral sides, but neither right nor left was more 
consistently affected. These data show the importance of analyzing bilateral 
hippocampi in the diagnostic evaluation of PART and potentially of other 
neurodegenerative diseases.

INTRODUCTION: Amyloid beta (Aβ) is partially cleared from the CSF via skull base 
perivascular and perineural lymphatic pathways, particularly at the nasal 
cavity. In vivo differences in Aβ level at the nasal cavity between patients 
with Alzheimer's disease (AD), subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 
cognitively normal (CN) individuals have not been previously assessed.
METHODS: This is a retrospective evaluation of subject level data from the 
ADNI-1/GO database. Standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) maximum on 
11C-Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB)-PET was assessed at the nasal cavity on 223 
scans. Exploratory ROI analysis was also performed at other skull base sites. 
SUVR maximum values and their differences between groups (CN, MCI, AD) were 
assessed. CSF Aβ levels and CSF Aβ 42/40 ratios were correlated with SUVR 
maximum values.
RESULTS: 103 subjects with 223 PiB-PET scans (47 CN, 32 AD and 144 MCI) were 
included in the study. The SUVR maxima at the nasal cavity were significantly 
lower in subjects with AD [1.35 (± 0.31)] compared to CN [1.54 (± 0.30); 
p = 0.024] and MCI [1.49 (± 0.33); p = 0.049]. At very low CSF Aβ, less than 
132 pg/ml, there was significant correlation with nasal cavity SUVR maximum. The 
summed averaged SUVR maximum values were significantly lower in subjects with AD 
[1.35 (± 0.16)] compared to CN [1.49 (± 0.17); p = 0.003] and MCI [1.40 
(± 0.17); p = 0.017].
CONCLUSION: Patients with AD demonstrate reduced nasal cavity PiB-PET 
radiotracer uptake compared to MCI and CN, possibly representing reduced Aβ 
clearance via perineural/perivascular lymphatic pathway. Further work is 
necessary to elucidate the true nature of this finding.

BACKGROUND: Researchers have proposed that impaired sleep may be a causal link 
in the progression from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's Disease 
(AD). Several recent findings suggest that enhancing deep sleep (N3) may improve 
neurological health in persons with MCI, and buffer the risk for AD. 
Specifically, Transcranial Electrical Stimulation (TES) of frontal brain areas, 
the inferred source of the Slow Oscillations (SOs) of N3 sleep, can extend N3 
sleep duration and improve declarative memory for recently learned information. 
Recent work in our laboratory using dense array Electroencephalography (dEEG) 
localized the sources of SOs to anterior limbic sites - suggesting that 
targeting these sites with TES may be more effective for enhancing N3.
METHODS: For the present study, we recruited 13 healthy adults (M = 42 years) to 
participate in three all-night sleep EEG recordings where they received low 
level (0.5 mA) TES designed to target anterior limbic areas and a sham 
stimulation (placebo). We used a convolutional neural network, trained and 
tested on professionally scored EEG sleep staging, to predict sleep stages for 
each recording.
RESULTS: When compared to the sham session, limbic-targeted TES significantly 
increased the duration of N3 sleep. TES also significantly increased spectral 
power in the 0.5-1 Hz frequency band (relative to pre-TES epochs) in left 
temporoparietal and left occipital scalp regions compared to sham.
CONCLUSION: These results suggest that even low-level TES, when specifically 
targeting anterior limbic sites, can increase deep (N3) sleep and thereby 
contribute to healthy sleep quality.

Alzheimer's disease is the most prevalent dementia among the elderly population. 
Early detection is critical because it can help with future planning for those 
potentially affected. This paper uses a three-dimensional DenseNet architecture 
to detect Alzheimer's disease in magnetic resonance imaging. Our work is 
restricted to the use of freely available tools. We constructed a deep neural 
network classifier with metrics of 0.86¯ mean accuracy, 0.86¯ mean sensitivity 
(micro-average), 0.86¯ mean specificity (micro-average), and 0.91¯ area under 
the receiver operating characteristic curve (micro-average) for the task of 
discriminating between five different disease stages or classes. The use of 
tools available for free ensures the reproducibility of the study and the 
applicability of the classification system in developing countries.

Background:  Early identification of cognitive decline is critical for 
identifying individuals for inclusion in clinical trials and for eventual care 
planning. Methods: A sample (ages 60-90 years) of consensus-diagnosed, 
community-dwelling Blacks (61 cognitively typical [HC], 28 amnestic mild 
cognitive impairment [aMCI], and 14 nonamnestic MCI [naMCI]) were recruited from 
the Michigan Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and the Wayne State University 
Institute of Gerontology. Participants received two resting state 
electroencephalograms (rsEEG, eyes closed) between which they engaged in a 
visual motion direction discrimination task. rsEEG %change current source 
densities across all frequency bands and regions of interest were calculated. 
Results: EEG current density was not different across groups for pre-task 
resting state. However, compared to HC, aMCI showed significantly greater 
declines at temporal and central cortical sites, while naMCI showed significant 
parietal declines. Conclusion: This novel approach of post-pre/cognitive 
challenge rsEEG successfully discriminated older persons with MCI from those 
without was sensitive to cognitive decline.

Alzheimer's disease effects human brain cells and results in dementia. The 
gradual deterioration of the brain cells results in disability of performing 
daily routine tasks. The treatment for this disease is still not mature enough. 
However, its early diagnosis may allow restraining the spread of disease. For 
early detection of Alzheimer's through brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), 
an automated detection and classification system needs to be developed that can 
detect and classify the subject having dementia. These systems also need not 
only to classify dementia patients but to also identify the four progressing 
stages of dementia. The proposed system works on an efficient technique of 
utilizing transfer learning to classify the images by fine-tuning a pre-trained 
convolutional network, AlexNet. The architecture is trained and tested over the 
pre-processed segmented (Grey Matter, White Matter, and Cerebral Spinal Fluid) 
and un-segmented images for both binary and multi-class classification. The 
performance of the proposed system is evaluated over Open Access Series of 
Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset. The algorithm showed promising results by 
giving the best overall accuracy of 92.85% for multi-class classification of 
un-segmented images.

Quantifying the degree of atrophy is done clinically by neuroradiologists 
following established visual rating scales. For these assessments to be reliable 
the rater requires substantial training and experience, and even then the rating 
agreement between two radiologists is not perfect. We have developed a model we 
call AVRA (Automatic Visual Ratings of Atrophy) based on machine learning 
methods and trained on 2350 visual ratings made by an experienced 
neuroradiologist. It provides fast and automatic ratings for Scheltens' scale of 
medial temporal atrophy (MTA), the frontal subscale of Pasquier's Global 
Cortical Atrophy (GCA-F) scale, and Koedam's scale of Posterior Atrophy (PA). We 
demonstrate substantial inter-rater agreement between AVRA's and a 
neuroradiologist ratings with Cohen's weighted kappa values of κw = 0.74/0.72 
(MTA left/right), κw = 0.62 (GCA-F) and κw = 0.74 (PA). We conclude that 
automatic visual ratings of atrophy can potentially have great scientific value, 
and aim to present AVRA as a freely available toolbox.

Leveraging Coupled Interaction for Multimodal Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis.

Shi Y, Suk HI, Gao Y, Lee SW, Shen D.

As the population becomes older worldwide, accurate computer-aided diagnosis for 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the early stage has been regarded as a crucial step 
for neurodegeneration care in recent years. Since it extracts the low-level 
features from the neuroimaging data, previous methods regarded this 
computer-aided diagnosis as a classification problem that ignored latent 
featurewise relation. However, it is known that multiple brain regions in the 
human brain are anatomically and functionally interlinked according to the 
current neuroscience perspective. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that the 
extracted features from different brain regions are related to each other to 
some extent. Also, the complementary information between different neuroimaging 
modalities could benefit multimodal fusion. To this end, we consider leveraging 
the coupled interactions in the feature level and modality level for diagnosis 
in this paper. First, we propose capturing the feature-level coupled interaction 
using a coupled feature representation. Then, to model the modality-level 
coupled interaction, we present two novel methods: 1) the coupled boosting (CB) 
that models the correlation of pairwise coupled-diversity on both inconsistently 
and incorrectly classified samples between different modalities and 2) the 
coupled metric ensemble (CME) that learns an informative feature projection from 
different modalities by integrating the intrarelation and interrelation of 
training samples. We systematically evaluated our methods with the AD 
neuroimaging initiative data set. By comparison with the baseline learning-based 
methods and the state-of-the-art methods that are specially developed for AD/MCI 
(mild cognitive impairment) diagnosis, our methods achieved the best performance 
with accuracy of 95.0% and 80.7% (CB), 94.9% and 79.9% (CME) for AD/NC (normal 
control), and MCI/NC identification, respectively.

BACKGROUND: The development of diagnostic and prognostic tools for Alzheimer 
disease is complicated by substantial clinical heterogeneity in prodromal 
stages. Many neuroimaging studies have focused on case–control classification 
and predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease, 
but predicting scores from clinical assessments (such as the Alzheimer’s Disease 
Assessment Scale or the Mini Mental State Examination) using MRI data has 
received less attention. Predicting clinical scores can be crucial in providing 
a nuanced prognosis and inferring symptomatic severity.
METHODS: We predicted clinical scores at the individual level using a novel 
anatomically partitioned artificial neural network (APANN) model. The model 
combined input from 2 structural MRI measures relevant to the neurodegenerative 
patterns observed in Alzheimer disease: hippocampal segmentations and cortical 
thickness. We evaluated the performance of the APANN model with 10 rounds of 
10-fold cross-validation in 3 experiments, using cohorts from the Alzheimer’s 
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): ADNI1, ADNI2 and ADNI1 + 2.
RESULTS: Pearson correlation and root mean square error between the actual and 
predicted scores on the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale (ADNI1: r = 0.60; 
ADNI2: r = 0.68; ADNI1 + 2: r = 0.63) and Mini Mental State Examination (ADNI1: 
r = 0.52; ADNI2: r = 0.55; ADNI1 + 2: r = 0.55) showed that APANN can accurately 
infer clinical severity from MRI data.
LIMITATIONS: To rigorously validate the model, we focused primarily on large 
cross-sectional baseline data sets with only proof-of-concept longitudinal 
results.
CONCLUSION: The APANN provides a highly robust and scalable framework for 
predicting clinical severity at the individual level using high-dimensional, 
multimodal neuroimaging data.

Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging 
machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies 
among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories, do 
not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects' 
trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to 
address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain 
incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a 
pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we 
propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, 
long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor 
and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the 
progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, 
fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to 
standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric, regression-based 
DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a 
significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with 
p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of 
the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier 
applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly larger area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 
with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of 
MAE curves as a function of the amount of missing data reveals that the proposed 
LSTM algorithm achieves the best performance up until more than 74% missing 
values. Finally, it is illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to 
data with varying time intervals. This paper shows that built-in handling of 
missing values in training an LSTM network benefits the application of RNNs in 
neurodegenerative disease progression modeling in longitudinal cohorts.

Anatomical Landmark Based Deep Feature Representation for MR Images in Brain 
Disease Diagnosis.

Liu M, Zhang J, Nie D, Yap PT, Shen D.

Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize hand-crafted 
(e.g., voxel-based or region-based) biomarkers from structural magnetic 
resonance (MR) images as feature representations. However, these hand-crafted 
features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest defined by 
experts. Also, because of possibly heterogeneous property between the 
hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to 
sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a 
landmark-based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract 
patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's 
disease. We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in 
a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network for 
patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on 
subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's disease 
neuroimaging initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the minimal interval resonance 
imaging in alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) dataset. Experimental results of both 
tasks of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval demonstrate that 
the proposed LDFL method improves the performance of disease classification and 
MR image retrieval.

In conventional Magnetic Resonance (MR) image based methods, two stages are 
often involved to capture brain structural information for disease diagnosis, 
i.e., 1) manually partitioning each MR image into a number of 
regions-of-interest (ROIs), and 2) extracting pre-defined features from each ROI 
for diagnosis with a certain classifier. However, these pre-defined features 
often limit the performance of the diagnosis, due to challenges in 1) defining 
the ROIs and 2) extracting effective disease-related features. In this paper, we 
propose a landmark-based deep multi-instance learning (LDMIL) framework for 
brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, we first adopt a data-driven learning 
approach to discover disease-related anatomical landmarks in the brain MR 
images, along with their nearby image patches. Then, our LDMIL framework learns 
an end-to-end MR image classifier for capturing both the local structural 
information conveyed by image patches located by landmarks and the global 
structural information derived from all detected landmarks. We have evaluated 
our proposed framework on 1526 subjects from three public datasets (i.e., 
ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and MIRIAD), and the experimental results show that our 
framework can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches.

BACKGROUND: The number of patients with Alzheimer's disease is increasing 
rapidly every year. Scholars often use computer vision and machine learning 
methods to develop an automatic diagnosis system.
OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed a novel machine learning system that can 
make diagnoses automatically from brain magnetic resonance images.
METHODS: First, the brain imaging was processed, including skull stripping and 
spatial normalization. Second, one axial slice was selected from the volumetric 
image, and stationary wavelet entropy (SWE) was done to extract the texture 
features. Third, a single-hidden-layer neural network was used as the 
classifier. Finally, a predator-prey particle swarm optimization was proposed to 
train the weights and biases of the classifier.
RESULTS: Our method used 4-level decomposition and yielded 13 SWE features. The 
classification yielded an overall accuracy of 92.73±1.03%, a sensitivity of 
92.69±1.29%, and a specificity of 92.78±1.51%. The area under the curve is 
0.95±0.02. Additionally, this method only cost 0.88 s to identify a subject in 
online stage, after its volumetric image is preprocessed.
CONCLUSION: In terms of classification performance, our method performs better 
than 10 state-of-the-art approaches and the performance of human observers. 
Therefore, this proposed method is effective in the detection of Alzheimer's 
disease.

cortical gene expression profiles in frontotemporal lobar degeneration 
(FTLD)-related syndromes, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and healthy controls.
METHODS: We included 214 participants with CSF available recruited at two 
centers: 93 with FTLD-related syndromes, 57 patients with AD, and 64 healthy 
controls. CSF levels of amyloid β (Aβ)1-42, Aβ1-40, Aβ1-38, and soluble β 
fragment of APP (sAPPβ) were centrally analyzed. We compared CSF levels of 
APP-derived peptides between groups and, we studied the correlation between CSF 
biomarkers, cortical thickness, and domain-specific cognitive composites in each 
group. Then, we explored the relationship between cortical thickness, CSF levels 
of APP-derived peptides, and regional gene expression profile using a brain-wide 
regional gene expression data in combination with gene set enrichment analysis.
RESULTS: The CSF levels of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-38, and sAPPβ were lower in the 
FTLD-related syndromes group than in the AD and healthy controls group. CSF 
levels of all APP-derived peptides showed a positive correlation with cortical 
thickness and the executive cognitive composite in the FTLD-related syndromes 
group but not in the healthy control or AD groups. In the cortical regions where 
we observed a significant association between cortical thickness and CSF levels 
of APP-derived peptides, we found a reduced expression of genes related to 
synaptic function.
INTERPRETATION: APP-derived peptides in CSF may reflect FTLD-related 
neurodegeneration. This observation has important implications as Aβ1-42 levels 
are considered an indirect biomarker of cerebral amyloidosis.

INTRODUCTION: The neuropsychological battery of the Uniform Data Set (UDSNB) was 
implemented in 2005 by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) Alzheimer Disease 
Centers program to measure cognitive performance in dementia and mild cognitive 
impairment due to Alzheimer Disease. This paper describes a revision, the UDSNB 
3.0.
METHODS: The Neuropsychology Work Group of the NIA Clinical Task Force 
recommended revisions through a process of due diligence to address shortcomings 
of the original battery. The UDSNB 3.0 covers episodic memory, processing speed, 
executive function, language, and constructional ability. Data from 3602 
cognitively normal participants in the National Alzheimer Coordinating Center 
database were analyzed.
RESULTS: Descriptive statistics are presented. Multivariable linear regression 
analyses demonstrated score differences by age, sex, and education and were also 
used to create a normative calculator available online.
DISCUSSION: The UDSNB 3.0 neuropsychological battery provides a valuable non 
proprietary resource for conducting research on cognitive aging and dementia.

Subcortical brain structures are integral to motion, consciousness, emotions and 
learning. We identified common genetic variation related to the volumes of the 
nucleus accumbens, amygdala, brainstem, caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, 
putamen and thalamus, using genome-wide association analyses in almost 40,000 
individuals from CHARGE, ENIGMA and UK Biobank. We show that variability in 
subcortical volumes is heritable, and identify 48 significantly associated loci 
(40 novel at the time of analysis). Annotation of these loci by utilizing gene 
expression, methylation and neuropathological data identified 199 genes 
putatively implicated in neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, axonal transport, 
apoptosis, inflammation/infection and susceptibility to neurological disorders. 
This set of genes is significantly enriched for Drosophila orthologs associated 
with neurodevelopmental phenotypes, suggesting evolutionarily conserved 
mechanisms. Our findings uncover novel biology and potential drug targets 
underlying brain development and disease.
