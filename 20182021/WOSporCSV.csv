The diagnosis of AD and its progression is performed through a variety of clinical procedures including neuropsychological and physical examination, Electroencephalographic (EEG) recording, brain imaging and blood analysis. During the last decades, analysis of the electrophysiological dynamics in AD patients has gained great research interest, as an alternative and cost-effective approach. This paper summarizes recent publications focusing on (a) AD detection and (b) the correlation of quantitative EEG features with AD progression, as it is estimated by Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) score. A total of 49 experimental studies published from 2009 until 2020, which apply machine learning algorithms on resting state EEG recordings from AD patients, are reviewed. Results of each experimental study are presented and compared. The majority of the studies focus on AD detection incorporating Support Vector Machines, while deep learning techniques have not yet been applied on large EEG datasets. Promising conclusions for future studies are presented.;0129-0657;1793-6462;;MAY;2021;31;10.1142/S0129065721300023;J

In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely used on analysis of neuroimage for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided diagnosis of AD or prediction on the conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. In this study, we aimed to develop a new deep learning method to detect or predict AD in an efficient way. Materials and methods: We proposed a densely connected convolution neural network with connection-wise attention mechanism to learn the multi-level features of brain MR images for AD classification. We used the densely connected neural network to extract multi-scale features from pre-processed images, and connection wise attention mechanism was applied to combine connections among features from different layers to hierarchically transform the MR images into more compact high-level features. Furthermore, we extended the convolution operation to 3D to capture the spatial information of MRI. The features extracted from each 3D convolution layer were integrated with features from all preceding layers with different attention, and were finally used for classification. Our method was evaluated on the baseline MRI of 968 subjects from ADNI database to discriminate (1) AD versus healthy subjects, (2) MCI converters versus healthy subjects, and (3) MCI converters versus non-converters. Results: The proposed method achieved 97.35% accuracy for distinguishing AD patients from healthy control, 87.82% for MCI converters against healthy control, and 78.79% for MCI converters against non-converters. Compared with some neural networks and methods reported in recent studies, the classification performance of our proposed algorithm was among the top ranks and improved in discriminating MCI subjects who were in high risks of conversion to AD. Conclusions: Deep learning techniques provide a powerful tool to explore minute but intricate characteristics in MR images which may facilitate early diagnosis and prediction of AD.";0730-725X;1873-5894;;MAY;2021;78;10.1016/j.mri.2021.02.001;J

Deep learning architecture produces impressive results in such research. Algorithms require a large number of annotated datasets for training the model. In this study, we overcome this issue by using layer-wise transfer learning as well as tissue segmentation of brain images to diagnose the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In layer-wise transfer learning, we used the VGG architecture family with pre-trained weights. The proposed model segregates between normal control (NC), the early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), the late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI), and the AD. In this paper, 85 NC patients, 70 EMCI, 70 LMCI, and 75 AD patients access form the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Tissue segmentation was applied on each subject to extract the gray matter (GM) tissue. In order to check the validity, the proposed method is tested on preprocessing data and achieved the highest rates of the classification accuracy on AD vs NC is 98.73%, also distinguish between EMCI vs LMCI patients testing accuracy 83.72%, whereas remaining classes accuracy is more than 80%.

Functional Connectivity (FC) catches the transient relationship between various brain regions usually measured by correlation analysis. The elements of the correlation matrix are between-1 to 1. Some of them are very small values usually related to weak and spurious correlations due to noises and artifacts. They can not be concluded as real strong correlations between brain regions and their existence could make a misconception and leads to fake results. It is crucial to make a conclusion based on reliable and informative correlations. In order to eliminate weak correla-tions, thresholding is a common method. In this routine, by adjusting a threshold the values below the threshold turn to zero and the rest remains. In this paper, in addition to thresholding, two other meth-ods including spectral sparsification based on Effective Resistance (ER) and autoencoders are investigated for sparsing the correlation matrices. Autoencoders are based on deep learning neural networks and ER considers the network as a resistive circuit. The fMRI data of the study correspond to Alzheimer & rsquo;s pa-tients and control subjects. Graph global measures are calculated and a non-parametric permutation test is reported. Results show that the autoencoder and spectral sparsification achieved more distinctive brain graphs between healthy and AD subjects. Also, more graph global features were significantly different from these two methods due to better elimination of weak correlations and preserve more informa-tive ones. Regardless of the sparsification method features including average strength, clustering, local efficiency, modularity, and transitivity are significantly different (P-value= 0.05). On the other hand, the measures radius, diameter, and eccentricity showed no significant differences in none of the methods. In addition, according to three different methods, the brain regions show fragile and solid FCs are deter-mined. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This paper uses graph theory to analyze the constructed brain network, and extracts the node degree, node efficiency, and node betweenness centrality parameters of the two modal brain networks. The T test method is used to analyze the difference of graph theory parameters between normal people and AD patients, and brain regions with significant differences in graph theory parameters are selected as brain network features. By analyzing the calculation principles of the conventional convolutional layer and the depth separable convolution unit, the computational complexity of them is compared. The depth separable convolution unit decomposes the traditional convolution process into spatial convolution for feature extraction and point convolution for feature combination, which greatly reduces the number of multiplication and addition operations in the convolution process, while still being able to obtain comparisons. Aiming at the special convolution structure of the depth separable convolution unit, this paper proposes a channel pruning method based on the convolution structure and explains its pruning process. Multimodal neuroimaging can provide complete information for the quantification of Alzheimer's disease. This paper proposes a cascaded three-dimensional neural network framework based on single-modal and multi-modal images, using MRI and PET images to distinguish AD and MCI from normal samples. Multiple three-dimensional CNN networks are used to extract recognizable information in local image blocks. The high-level two-dimensional CNN network fuses multi-modal features and selects the features of discriminative regions to perform quantitative predictions on samples. The algorithm proposed in this paper can automatically extract and fuse the features of multi-modality and multi-regions layer by layer, and the visual analysis results show that the abnormally changed regions affected by Alzheimer's disease provide important information for clinical quantification.;;1662-453X;;MAR 17;2021;15;10.3389/fnins.2021.651920;J

We evaluated if a modified GAN can learn from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of multiple magnetic field strengths to enhance Alzheimer's disease (AD) classification performance. Methods T1-weighted brain MRI scans from 151 participants of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), who underwent both 1.5-Tesla (1.5-T) and 3-Tesla imaging at the same time were selected to construct a GAN model. This model was trained along with a three-dimensional fully convolutional network (FCN) using the generated images (3T*) as inputs to predict AD status. Quality of the generated images was evaluated using signal to noise ratio (SNR), Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial Quality Evaluator (BRISQUE) and Natural Image Quality Evaluator (NIQE). Cases from the Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL, n = 107) and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC, n = 565) were used for model validation. Results The 3T*-based FCN classifier performed better than the FCN model trained using the 1.5-T scans. Specifically, the mean area under curve increased from 0.907 to 0.932, from 0.934 to 0.940, and from 0.870 to 0.907 on the ADNI test, AIBL, and NACC datasets, respectively. Additionally, we found that the mean quality of the generated (3T*) images was consistently higher than the 1.5-T images, as measured using SNR, BRISQUE, and NIQE on the validation datasets. Conclusion This study demonstrates a proof of principle that GAN frameworks can be constructed to augment AD classification performance and improve image quality.;;1758-9193;;MAR 14;2021;13;10.1186/s13195-021-00797-5;J

There is no definite biomarker signature to determine this eventual progress. The discovery and development of prognostic biomarker signatures for AD is essential to address the challenges of AD drug discovery and development. The deep learning (DL) technique is a recent breakthrough in data science that enables researchers to discover previously unknown features comprised by complicated patterns learnt from large datasets. It has outperformed many traditional machine learning methods in computer vision tasks. In this article, we evaluated the performance of DL algorithms in differentiating patients with diagnosis of AD, MCI, or no evidence of dementia using baseline MRI data of the brain, and integrated features extracted from the neural network with other baseline biomarkers to develop an AD prognostic signature. This signature can be used to understand the patient heterogeneity in a study cohort and provide enrichment strategies for AD clinical trial design.;1946-6315;;;;;;10.1080/19466315.2021.1884129;J
"AbdulAzeem, Y; Bahgat, WM; Badawy, M";"AbdulAzeem, Yousry; Bahgat, Waleed M.; Badawy, Mahmoud";A CNN based framework for classification of Alzheimer's disease;NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS;In the current decade, advances in health care are attracting widespread interest due to their contributions to people longer surviving and fitter lives. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest neurodegenerative and dementing disease. The monetary value of caring for Alzheimer's disease patients is involved to rise dramatically. The necessity of having a computer-aided system for early and accurate AD classification becomes crucial. Deep-learning algorithms have notable advantages rather than machine learning methods. Many recent research studies that have used brain MRI scans and convolutional neural networks (CNN) achieved promising results for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Accordingly, this study proposes a CNN based end-to-end framework for AD-classification. The proposed framework achieved 99.6%, 99.8%, and 97.8% classification accuracies on Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset for the binary classification of AD and Cognitively Normal (CN).

Methods We studied in 96 monozygotic twin-pairs relationships between amyloid-beta (A beta) aggregation as measured by the A beta 1-42/1-40 ratio in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF; n = 126) and positron emission tomography (PET, n = 194), and CSF markers for A beta production (beta-secretase 1, A beta 1-40, and A beta 1-38) and CSF tau. Associations among markers were tested with generalized estimating equations including a random effect for twin status, adjusted for age, gender, and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 genotype. We used twin analyses to determine relative contributions of genetic and/or environmental factors to AD pathophysiological processes. Results Twenty-seven individuals (14%) had an abnormal amyloid PET, and 14 twin-pairs (15%) showed discordant amyloid PET scans. Within twin-pairs, A beta production markers and total-tau (t-tau) levels strongly correlated (r range = 0.73-0.86, all p < 0.0001), and A beta aggregation markers and 181-phosphorylated-tau (p-tau) levels correlated moderately strongly (r range = 0.50-0.64, all p < 0.0001). Cross-twin cross-trait analysis showed that A beta 1-38 in one twin correlated with A beta 1-42/1-40 ratios, and t-tau and p-tau levels in their cotwins (r range = -0.28 to 0.58, all p < .007). Within-pair differences in A beta production markers related to differences in tau levels (r range = 0.49-0.61, all p < 0.0001). Twin discordance analyses suggest that A beta production and tau levels show coordinated increases in very early AD. Interpretation Our results suggest a substantial genetic/shared environmental background contributes to both A beta and tau increases, suggesting that modulation of environmental risk factors may aid in delaying the onset of AD pathophysiological processes.

The model consists of three parts: a parallel-network encoder, which is comprised of a convolutional pipeline and a dilated convolutional pipeline that extracts global and local features and concatenates them, a decoder that reconstructs the input image from the obtained feature vector, and a discriminator that distinguishes if the input image image is real or fake. The hypothesis is that if the proposed model is trained with only normal brain images, the corresponding construction loss for normal images should be minimal. However, if the input image belongs to a class that is designated as an anomaly that which the model is not trained with, then the construction loss will be high. This will reflect during the anomaly score comparison between the normal and the anomalous image. A multi-case analysis is performed for three major classes using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and normal control. The base parallel-encoder network shows better classification accuracy than the benchmark models, and the proposed model that is built on the parallel model outperforms the benchmark anomaly detection models. The proposed model gave out 96.03% and 75.21% in classification and area under the curve score, respectively. Additionally, a qualitative evaluation done by using Frechet inception distance gave a better score than the state-of-the-art by three points.;;2076-3417;;MAR;2021;11;10.3390/app11052187;J

Predicting which patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will progress to DAT is an ongoing challenge in the field. We developed a deep learning model to predict conversion from MCI to DAT. Structural magnetic resonance imaging scans were used as input to a 3-dimensional convolutional neural network. The 3-dimensional convolutional neural network was trained using transfer learning; in the source task, normal control and DAT scans were used to pretrain the model. This pretrained model was then retrained on the target task of classifying which MCI patients converted to DAT. Our model resulted in 82.4% classification accuracy at the target task, outperforming current models in the field. Next, we visualized brain regions that significantly contribute to the prediction of MCI conversion using an occlusion map approach. Contributory regions included the pons, amygdala, and hippocampus. Finally, we showed that the model's prediction value is significantly correlated with rates of change in clinical assessment scores, indicating that the model is able to predict an individual patient's future cognitive decline. This information, in conjunction with the identified anatomical features, will aid in building a personalized therapeutic strategy for individuals with MCI.

Methods In this retrospective study, we enrolled 22 cognitively normal subjects, 20 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 42 patients with Alzheimer disease. Twenty minutes of list-mode PET/CT data were acquired and reconstructed as the ground-truth images. The short-time scans were made in either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 minutes. The CNN with a residual learning framework was implemented to predict the ground-truth images of F-18-FBB PET/CT using short-time scans with either a single-slice or a 3-slice input layer. Model performance was evaluated by quantitative and qualitative analyses. Additionally, we quantified the amyloid load in the ground-truth and predicted images using the SUV ratio. Results On quantitative analyses, with increasing scan time, the normalized root-mean-squared error and the SUV ratio differences between predicted and ground-truth images gradually decreased, and the peak signal-to-noise ratio increased. On qualitative analysis, the predicted images from the 3-slice CNN model showed better image quality than those from the single-slice model. The 3-slice CNN model with a short-time scan of at least 2 minutes achieved comparable, quantitative prediction of full-time F-18-FBB PET/CT images, with adequate to excellent image quality.

A convolutional neural network (CNN) with a concatenated connection and residual learning framework was implemented. PET data from 27 patients were acquired for 900 s, starting 60 minutes after the intravenous administration of FDG using a commercial PET/CT scanner. To investigate the effect of scan time on the quality of the predicted H-PETs, 10 s, 30 s, 60 s, and 120 s PET data were generated by sorting the 900 s LMF data into the LMF data acquired for each scan time. Twenty-three of the 27 patient images were used for training of the proposed CNN and the remaining four patient images were used for test of the CNN. The predicted H-PETs generated by the CNN were compared to ground-truth H-PETs, L-PETS, and filtered L-PETS processed with four commonly used denoising algorithms. The peak signal-to-noise ratios (PSNRs), normalized root mean square errors (NRMSEs), and average region-of-interest (ROI) differences as a function of scan time were calculated. The quality of the predicted H-PETs generated by the CNN was superior to that of the L-PETs and filtered L-PETs. Lower NRMSEs and higher PSNRs were also obtained from predicted H-PETs compared to the L-PETS and filtered L-PETS. ROI differences in the predicted H-PETs were smaller than those of the L-PETS. The quality of the predicted H-PETs gradually improved with increasing scan times. The lowest NRMSEs, highest PSNRs, and smallest ROI differences were obtained using the predicted H-PETs for 120 s. Various performance test results for the proposed CNN indicate that it is possible to generate H-PETs from neuro FDG L-PETS using the proposed CNN method, which might allow reductions in both scan time and injection dose.;2156-7018;2156-7026;;MAR;2021;11;10.1166/jmihi.2021.3316;J
"Li, Q; Yang, MQ";"Li, Qi; Yang, Mary Qu";Comparison of machine learning approaches for enhancing Alzheimer's disease classification;PEERJ;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, accounting for nearly 60% of all dementia cases. The occurrence of the disease has been increasing rapidly in recent years. Presently about 46.8 million individuals suffer from AD worldwide. The current absence of effective treatment to reverse or stop AD progression highlights the importance of disease prevention and early diagnosis. Brain structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been widely used for AD detection as it can display morphometric differences and cerebral structural changes. In this study, we built three machine learning-based MRI data classifiers to predict AD and infer the brain regions that contribute to disease development and progression. We then systematically compared the three distinct classifiers, which were constructed based on Support Vector Machine (SVM), 3D Very Deep Convolutional Network (VGGNet) and 3D Deep Residual Network (ResNet), respectively. To improve the performance of the deep learning classifiers, we applied a transfer learning strategy. The weights of a pre-trained model were transferred and adopted as the initial weights of our models. Transferring the learned features significantly reduced training time and increased network efficiency. The classification accuracy for AD subjects from elderly control subjects was 90%, 95%, and 95% for the SVM, VGGNet and ResNet classifiers, respectively. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) was employed to show discriminative regions that contributed most to the AD dassification by utilizing the learned spatial information of the 3D-VGGNet and 3D-ResNet models. The resulted maps consistently highlighted several disease-associated brain regions, particularly the cerebellum which is a relatively neglected brain region in the present AD study. Overall, our comparisons suggested that the ResNet model provided the best classification performance as well as more accurate localization of disease-associated regions in the brain compared to the other two approaches.;2167-8359;;;FEB 25;2021;9;10.7717/peerj.10549;J

In this paper, we used data set collected from ADNI and OASIS. Instead of using the whole volume of the MRI, high informative slices are selected using entropy. The selected slices are pre-processed by removing unwanted tissues using skull stripping algorithm and extracted gray matter using EICA. In this work, we used CNN model with inception blocks to extract deep features from the GM slices used to predict AD at early stage. The model avoids data leakage by considering all the slices of an MRI as a unit. The model trained with 80% of ADNI subject MRI volumes and tested with the remaining 20% subject MRI volumes, to provide great variance in training and testing data, the model further tested with OASIS data sets. 10-fold cross-validation is used to test the model without biasing. The model performance is evaluated using accuracy. The model achieves 98.73%, 100%, 93.72%, and 95.6% of accuracy for differentiating CN-MCI, CN-AD, AD- MCI and CN-MCI and AD. At 10-fold cross-validation it gives 92.92 +/- 3%, 98 +/- 2%, 90 +/- 4% and 94.9 +/- 2% accuracy to differentiate CN-MCI, CN-AD, AD-MCI, and CN-MCI-AD using ADNI. We further tested the model with 135 MRI volumes selected from OASIS data set, we achieved 92%, 91.76%, 88.23%, 81.48% of accuracy with CN-AD, MCI-AD, CN-MCI, and three-way classification.

K.; Bayat, Oguz; Duru, Adil D.";Diagnosis of Alzheimer Disease Using 2D MRI Slices by Convolutional Neural Network;APPLIED BIONICS AND BIOMECHANICS;There are many kinds of brain abnormalities that cause changes in different parts of the brain. Alzheimer's disease is a chronic condition that degenerates the cells of the brain leading to memory asthenia. Cognitive mental troubles such as forgetfulness and confusion are one of the most important features of Alzheimer's patients. In the literature, several image processing techniques, as well as machine learning strategies, were introduced for the diagnosis of the disease. This study is aimed at recognizing the presence of Alzheimer's disease based on the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. We adopted a deep learning methodology for the discrimination between Alzheimer's patients and healthy patients from 2D anatomical slices collected using magnetic resonance imaging. Most of the previous researches were based on the implementation of a 3D convolutional neural network, whereas we incorporated the usage of 2D slices as input to the convolutional neural network. The data set of this research was obtained from the OASIS website. We trained the convolutional neural network structure using the 2D slices to exhibit the deep network weightings that we named as the Alzheimer Network (AlzNet). The accuracy of our enhanced network was 99.30%. This work investigated the effects of many parameters on AlzNet, such as the number of layers, number of filters, and dropout rate. The results were interesting after using many performance metrics for evaluating the proposed AlzNet.;1176-2322;1754-2103;;FEB 2;2021;2021;10.1155/2021/6690539;J

Automatic segmentation is an active research field, with many recent models using deep learning. Most current state-of-the art hippocampus segmentation methods train their methods on healthy or Alzheimer's disease patients from public datasets. This raises the question whether these methods are capable of recognizing the hippocampus on a different domain, that of epilepsy patients with hippocampus resection. New Method: In this paper we present a state-of-the-art, open source, ready-to-use, deep learning based hippocampus segmentation method. It uses an extended 2D multi-orientation approach, with automatic preprocessing and orientation alignment. The methodology was developed and validated using HarP, a public Alzheimer's disease hippocampus segmentation dataset. Results and Comparisons: We test this methodology alongside other recent deep learning methods, in two domains: The HarP test set and an in-house epilepsy dataset, containing hippocampus resections, named HCUnicamp. We show that our method, while trained only in HarP, surpasses others from the literature in both the HarP test set and HCUnicamp in Dice. Additionally, Results from training and testing in HCUnicamp volumes are also reported separately, alongside comparisons between training and testing in epilepsy and Alzheimer's data and vice versa. Conclusion: Although current state-of-the-art methods, including our own, achieve upwards of 0.9 Dice in HarP, all tested methods, including our own, produced false positives in HCUnicamp resection regions, showing that there is still room for improvement for hippocampus segmentation methods when resection is involved.;2405-8440;;;FEB;2021;7;10.1016/j.heliyon.2021.e06226;J

For AD classification, we propose a new hybrid method for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using Polar Harmonic Transforms (PHT) and Self-adaptive Differential Evolution Wavelet Neural Network (SaDE-WNN). The orthogonal moments are used for feature extraction from the grey matter tissues of structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data. Irrelevant features are removed by the feature selection process through evaluating the in-class and among-class variance. In recent years, WNNs have gained attention in classification tasks; however, they suffer from the problem of initial parameter tuning, parameter setting. We proposed a WNN with the self-adaptation technique for controlling the Differential Evolution (DE) parameters, i.e., the mutation scale factor (F) and the cross-over rate (CR). Experimental results on the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database indicate that the proposed method yields the best overall classification results between AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (93.7% accuracy, 86.0% sensitivity, 98.0% specificity, and 0.97 area under the curve (AUC)), MCI and healthy control (HC) (92.9% accuracy, 95.2% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, and 0.98 AUC), and AD and HC (94.4% accuracy, 88.7% sensitivity, 98.9% specificity and 0.99 AUC).";;2076-3417;;FEB;2021;11;10.3390/app11041574;J

Appropriate and punctual disease identification and treatment arrangement directs to enhance superiority of life and improved life hope in Alzheimer Disease (AD) patients. The cutting-edge approaches that believe multimodal analysis have been shown to be efficient and accurate are improved compared with manual analysis. Many tools have been introduced for detection of Alzheimer but still it is a financially high costly diagnosis system gives detection of disease with low accuracy and efficient due to performance of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning devices. A novel methodology is proposed in this research as CAD process using various algorithms for predicting AD. The MRI images from scanning device are a highly noisy image due to thermal activities of hardware involved in scanning device. The image restoration technique is applied using 2D Adaptive Bilateral Filter (2D-ABF) algorithm. The quality of image in terms of brightness and contrast are improved using image enhancement techniques based on Adaptive Histogram Adjustment (AHA) algorithm. The Region of Interest of Alzheimer disease is segmented using Adaptive Mean Shift Modified Expectation Maximization (AMS-MEM) algorithm. The various features are calculated using second order 2-Dimensional Gray Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (2D-GLCM).

"Herzog, NJ; Magoulas, GD";"Herzog, Nitsa J.; Magoulas, George D.";Brain Asymmetry Detection and Machine Learning Classification for Diagnosis of Early Dementia;SENSORS;Early identification of degenerative processes in the human brain is considered essential for providing proper care and treatment. This may involve detecting structural and functional cerebral changes such as changes in the degree of asymmetry between the left and right hemispheres. Changes can be detected by computational algorithms and used for the early diagnosis of dementia and its stages (amnestic early mild cognitive impairment (EMCI), Alzheimer's Disease (AD)), and can help to monitor the progress of the disease. In this vein, the paper proposes a data processing pipeline that can be implemented on commodity hardware. It uses features of brain asymmetries, extracted from MRI of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, for the analysis of structural changes, and machine learning classification of the pathology. The experiments provide promising results, distinguishing between subjects with normal cognition (NC) and patients with early or progressive dementia. Supervised machine learning algorithms and convolutional neural networks tested are reaching an accuracy of 92.5% and 75.0% for NC vs. EMCI, and 93.0% and 90.5% for NC vs. AD, respectively. The proposed pipeline offers a promising low-cost alternative for the classification of dementia and can be potentially useful to other brain degenerative disorders that are accompanied by changes in the brain asymmetries.;;1424-8220;;FEB;2021;21;10.3390/s21030778;J

The purpose of the present review was to summarize the literature on the developing field of deep learning (DL), particularly the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in PET/CT and PET/MR. Methods We performed the literature search, referring to convolutional neural networks and positron emission tomography on PubMed/MEDLINE, for potentially relevant articles published up until July 24th, 2020. Results After the screening process, 63 articles were finally included; these embraced both the technical (n = 23) and the clinical field (n = 40). Technical studies aimed at investigating the role of CNN-based methods for image quality improvement (n = 11) and on technical issues (n = 12), mainly attenuation correction. Clinical studies explored CNN applications in oncology lung cancer (n = 7), head and neck cancer (n = 4), esophageal cancer (n = 2), lymphoma (n = 3), prostate cancer (N = 4), cervical cancer (n = 1), sarcomas (n = 1), multiple cancer types (n = 4), in neurology (n = 10) and cardiology (n = 1); three additional studies belonged to other category.

Previous studies suggest that the deep learning (DL) techniques have the potential to solve the differential diagnosis problem of FTD, AD and normal controls (NCs), but its performance is still unclear. In addition, existing DL-assisted diagnostic studies still rely on hypothesis-based expert-level preprocessing. On the one hand, it imposes high requirements on clinicians and data themselves; On the other hand, it hinders the backtracking of classification results to the original image data, resulting in the classification results cannot be interpreted intuitively. In the current study, a large cohort of 3D T1-weighted structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumes (n = 4,099) was collected from two publicly available databases, i.e., the ADNI and the NIFD. We trained a DL-based network directly based on raw T1 images to classify FTD, AD and corresponding NCs. And we evaluated the convergence speed, differential diagnosis ability, robustness and generalizability under nine scenarios. The proposed network yielded an accuracy of 91.83% based on the most common T1-weighted sequence [magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)]. The knowledge learned by the DL network through multiple classification tasks can also be used to solve subproblems, and the knowledge is generalizable and not limited to a specified dataset. Furthermore, we applied a gradient visualization algorithm based on guided backpropagation to calculate the contribution graph, which tells us intuitively why the DL-based networks make each decision. The regions making valuable contributions to FTD were more widespread in the right frontal white matter regions, while the left temporal, bilateral inferior frontal and parahippocampal regions were contributors to the classification of AD. Our results demonstrated that DL-based networks have the ability to solve the enigma of differential diagnosis of diseases without any hypothesis-based preprocessing. Moreover, they may mine the potential patterns that may be different from human clinicians, which may provide new insight into the understanding of FTD and AD.";;1662-453X;;JAN 21;2021;14;10.3389/fnins.2020.626154;J

Though current DLB diagnostic criteria employ several indicative biomarkers, relative preservation of the medial temporal lobe as revealed by structural MRI suffers from low sensitivity and specificity, making them unreliable as sole supporting biomarkers. In this study, we investigated how a deep learning approach would be able to differentiate DLB from AD with structural MRI data. Methods: Two-hundred and eight patients (101 DLB, 69 AD, and 38 controls) participated in this retrospective study. Gray matter images were extracted using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). In order to compare the conventional statistical analysis with deep-learning feature extraction, we built a classification model for DLB and AD with a residual neural network (ResNet) type of convolutional neural network architecture, which is one of the deep learning models. The anatomically standardized gray matter images extracted in the same way as for the VBM process were used as inputs, and the classification performance achieved by our model was evaluated. Results: Conventional statistical analysis detected no significant atrophy other than fine differences on the middle temporal pole and hippocampal regions. The feature extracted by the deep learning method differentiated DLB from AD with 79.15% accuracy compared to the 68.41% of the conventional method. Conclusions: Our results confirmed that the deep learning method with gray matter images can detect fine differences between DLB and AD that may be underestimated by the conventional method.;1051-2284;1552-6569;;;;;10.1111/jon.12835;J

In this study, we proposed a sparse-response deep belief network (SR-DBN) model based on rate distortion (RD) theory and an extreme learning machine (ELM) model to distinguish AD, MCI, and normal controls (NC). We used [F-18]-AV45 positron emission computed tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images from 340 subjects enrolled in the ADNI database, including 116 AD, 82 MCI, and 142 NC subjects. The model was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. In the whole model, fast principal component analysis (PCA) served as a dimension reduction algorithm. An SR-DBN extracted features from the images, and an ELM obtained the classification. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we performed comparative trials. In contrast experiment 1, the ELM was replaced by a support vector machine (SVM). Contrast experiment 2 adopted DBN without sparsity. Contrast experiment 3 consisted of fast PCA and an ELM. Contrast experiment 4 used a classic convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify AD. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were examined to validate the results.

Yet, traditional fMRI research on resting-state networks (RSNs) has favored static and average connectivity methods, which by overlooking the fluctuation dynamics triggered by neurodegeneration, have yielded inconsistent results. The present multicenter study introduces a data-driven machine learning pipeline based on dynamic connectivity fluctuation analysis (DCFA) on RS-fMRI data from 300 participants belonging to three groups: behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) patients, Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, and healthy controls. We considered non-linear oscillatory patterns across combined and individual resting-state networks (RSNs), namely: the salience network (SN), mostly affected in bvFTD; the default mode network (DMN), mostly affected in AD; the executive network (EN), partially compromised in both conditions; the motor network (MN); and the visual network (VN). These RSNs were entered as features for dementia classification using a recent robust machine learning approach (a Bayesian hyperparameter tuned Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) algorithm), across four independent datasets with different MR scanners and recording parameters. The machine learning classification accuracy analysis revealed a systematic and unique tailored architecture of RSN disruption. The classification accuracy ranking showed that the most affected networks for bvFTD were the SN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.43%, AUC = 0.91, sensitivity = 86.45%, specificity = 87.54%); for AD, the DMN + EN network pair (mean accuracy = 86.63%, AUC = 0.89, sensitivity = 88.37%, specificity = 84.62%); and for the bvFTD vs. AD classification, the DMN + SN network pair (mean accuracy = 82.67%, AUC = 0.86, sensitivity = 81.27%, specificity = 83.01%). Moreover, the DFCA classification systematically outperformed canonical connectivity approaches (including both static and linear dynamic connectivity).

In this Review, we consider the effects of MS pathology on brain networks, as assessed using MRI, and how these changes to brain networks translate into clinical impairments. We also discuss how this knowledge can inform the targeting of MS treatments and the potential future directions for research in this area. Studying MS is challenging as its pathology involves neurodegenerative and focal inflammatory elements, both of which could disrupt neural networks. The disruption of white matter tracts in MS is reflected in changes in network efficiency, an increasingly random grey matter network topology, relative cortical disconnection, and both increases and decreases in connectivity centred around hubs such as the thalamus and the default mode network. The results of initial longitudinal studies suggest that these changes evolve rather than simply increase over time and are linked with clinical features.

Therefore, we evaluated deep learning enhancement using a significantly reduced injected radiotracer protocol for amyloid PET/MRI. Methods Eighteen participants underwent two separate F-18-florbetaben PET/MRI studies in which an ultra-low-dose (6.64 +/- 3.57 MBq, 2.2 +/- 1.3% of standard) or a standard-dose (300 +/- 14 MBq) was injected. The PET counts from the standard-dose list-mode data were also undersampled to approximate an ultra-low-dose session. A pre-trained convolutional neural network was fine-tuned using MR images and either the injected or sampled ultra-low-dose PET as inputs. Image quality of the enhanced images was evaluated using three metrics (peak signal-to-noise ratio, structural similarity, and root mean square error), as well as the coefficient of variation (CV) for regional standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). Mean cerebral uptake was correlated across image types to assess the validity of the sampled realizations. To judge clinical performance, four trained readers scored image quality on a five-point scale (using 15% non-inferiority limits for proportion of studies rated 3 or better) and classified cases into amyloid-positive and negative studies. Results The deep learning-enhanced PET images showed marked improvement on all quality metrics compared with the low-dose images as well as having generally similar regional CVs as the standard-dose. All enhanced images were non-inferior to their standard-dose counterparts. Accuracy for amyloid status was high (97.2% and 91.7% for images enhanced from injected and sampled ultra-low-dose data, respectively) which was similar to intra-reader reproducibility of standard-dose images (98.6%). Conclusion Deep learning methods can synthesize diagnostic-quality PET images from ultra-low injected dose simultaneous PET/MRI data, demonstrating the general validity of sampled realizations and the potential to reduce dose significantly for amyloid imaging.;1619-7070;1619-7089;;;;;10.1007/s00259-020-05151-9;J

In this work, we propose a novel amyloid-PET quantification approach that harnesses the intermodal image translation capability of convolutional networks to remove this undesirable source of variability. Methods Paired MR and PET images exhibiting very low specific uptake were selected from a Singaporean amyloid-PET study involving 172 participants with different severities of CeVD. Two convolutional neural networks (CNN), ScaleNet and HighRes3DNet, and one conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) were trained to map structural MR to NS PET images. NS estimates generated for all subjects using the most promising network were then subtracted from SUVr images to determine specific amyloid load only (SA beta(L)). Associations of SA beta(L) with various cognitive and functional test scores were then computed and compared to results using conventional SUVr. Results Multimodal ScaleNet outperformed other networks in predicting the NS content in cortical gray matter with a mean relative error below 2%. Compared to SUVr, SA beta(L) showed increased association with cognitive and functional test scores by up to 67%. Conclusion Removing the undesirable NS uptake from the amyloid load measurement is possible using deep learning and substantially improves its accuracy. This novel analysis approach opens a new window of opportunity for improved data modeling in Alzheimer's disease and for other neurodegenerative diseases that utilize PET imaging.;1619-7070;1619-7089;;;;;10.1007/s00259-020-05131-z;J

It is common cancer in adults and children. It has the lowest survival rate and various types depending on their location, texture, and shape. The wrong classification of the tumor brain will lead to bad consequences. Consequently, identifying the correct type and grade of tumor in the early stages has an important role to choose a precise treatment plan. Examining the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the patient's brain represents an effective technique to distinguish brain tumors. Due to the big amounts of data and the various brain tumor types, the manual technique becomes time-consuming and can lead to human errors. Therefore, an automated computer assisted diagnosis (CAD) system is required. The recent evolution in image classification techniques has shown great progress especially the deep convolution neural networks (CNNs) which have succeeded in this area. In this regard, we exploited CNN for the problem of brain tumor classification. We suggested a new model, which contains various layers in the aim to classify MRI brain tumor. The proposed model is experimentally evaluated on three datasets. Experimental results affirm that the suggested approach provides a convincing performance compared to existing methods.;1370-4621;1573-773X;;FEB;2021;53;10.1007/s11063-020-10398-2;J

Here, in this paper, a deep learning-based segmenting method using SegNet to detect AD pertinent brain parts features from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and subsequently classifying accurately AD and dementia condition using ResNet-101 is presented. A deep learning-based image segmenting approach is experimented in detecting the delicate features of brain morphological changes due to AD that benefits classification performance for cognitive normal, mild cognitive impairment and AD, and thus provides an easy automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's diseases. For classification, ResNet-101 is trained applying features extracted from SegNet with ADNI dataset. This paper demonstrated particularly to attain top-level automated classification. The seven morphological features like grey matter, white matter, cortex surface, gyri and sulci contour, cortex thickness, hippocampus and cerebrospinal fluid space extracted from 240 sMRI with SegNet are used to train ResNet for classification, and this classifier achieved a sensitivity of 96% and an accuracy of 95% over 240 ADNI sMRI other than used for training.;2193-567X;2191-4281;;;;;10.1007/s13369-020-05193-z;J

Traditional methods for hippocampus analysis usually computed the shape and volume features from structural Magnetic Resonance Image (sMRI) for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD as well as its prodromal stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Motivated by the success of deep learning, this paper proposes a deep learning method with the multi-channel cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn the combined hierarchical representations of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries from the binary hippocampal masks for AD classification. First, image segmentation is performed to generate the bilateral hippocampus binary masks for each subject and the mask difference is obtained by subtracting them. Second, multi-channel 3D CNNs are individually constructed on the hippocampus masks and mask differences to extract features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries for classification. Third, a 2D CNN is cascaded on the 3D CNNs to learn high-level correlation features. Finally, the features learned by multi-channel and cascaded CNNs are combined with a fully connected layer followed by a softmax classifier for disease classification. The proposed method can gradually learn the combined hierarchical features of hippocampal shapes and asymmetries to enhance the classification. Our method is verified on the baseline sMRIs from 807 subjects including 194 AD patients, 397 MCI (164 progressive MCI (pMCI) + 233 stable MCI (sMCI)), and 216 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an AUC (Area Under the ROC Curve) of 88.4%, 74.6% and 71.9% for AD vs. NC, MCI vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI classifications, respectively. It proves the promising classification performance and also shows that both hippocampal shape and asymmetry are helpful for AD diagnosis.;1931-7557;1931-7565;;;;;10.1007/s11682-020-00427-y;J

However, to enable the translation of these methods and test their usefulness in clinical practice, it is crucial to conduct independent validation on real clinical samples, which has yet to be properly delineated in the current literature. Objective: In this paper, we present our efforts to enable such clinical translational through the evaluation and comparison of two machine-learning methods for discrimination between dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) and Non-DAT controls. Methods: FDG-PET-based dementia scores were generated on an independent clinical sample whose clinical diagnosis was blinded to the algorithm designers. A feature-engineered approach (multi-kernel probability classifier) and a non-feature-engineered approach (3D convolutional neural network) were analyzed. Both classifiers were pre-trained on cognitively normal subjects as well as subjects with DAT. These two methods provided a probabilistic dementia score for this previously unseen clinical data. Performance of the algorithms were compared against ground-truth dementia rating assessed by experienced nuclear physicians. Results: Blinded clinical evaluation on both classifiers showed good separation between the cognitively normal subjects and the patients diagnosed with DAT. The non-feature-engineered dementia score showed higher sensitivity among subjects whose diagnosis was in agreement between the machine-learning models, while the feature-engineered approach showed higher specificity in non-consensus cases. Conclusion: In this study, we demonstrated blinded evaluation using data from an independent clinical sample for assessing the performance in DAT classification models in a clinical setting. Our results showed good generalizability for two machine-learning approaches, marking an important step for the translation of pre-trained machine-learning models into clinical practice.;1387-2877;1875-8908;;;2021;80;10.3233/JAD-201591;J

It is believed that the people with mild cognitive impairment are at high risk of developing this disease. According to the annual report released by the Alzheimer's Association (R) 2020, Alzheimer is the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. Thus, there is a need of educating people about this disease, reducing the risks by militating the necessary precautions to disseminate its affect by diagnosing it at early stages. It is also important to propose some recent advancement in this research which can help in early prediction of the disease using machine learning techniques. This paper intends to develop the novel algorithm by proposing changes in the designing of capsule network for best prediction results and making the model computationally efficient. The research is conducted on the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset with dimensions (373 X 15) to diagnose the labels into two groups, as demented and non-demented. The novelty lies in conducting the in-depth research in identifying the importance of features, correlation study between factors and density of data showing status of factors by studying hierarchical examination of all the data points available using exploratory data analysis. Several optimization functions are conducted on the variables and feature selection is done to make the model faster and more accurate. The claims have been validated by showing the correlation accuracy at several iterations and layers with an admissible accuracy of 92.39%. The model is compared with state-of-art deep learning classifiers taken as benchmarks using different performance metrics.

The Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), an advanced imaging technique, is capable of producing high quality images of the human body including the brain for diagnosis purposes. This paper proposes a simple but efficient solution for the classification of MRI brain images into normal, and abnormal images containing disorders and injuries. It uses images with brain tumor, acute stroke and alzheimer, besides normal images, from the public dataset developed by harvard medical school, for evaluation purposes. The proposed model is a four step process, in which the steps are named: 1). Pre-processing, 2). Features Extraction, 3). Features Reduction, and 4). Classification. Median filter, being one of the best algorithms, is used for the removal of noise such as salt and pepper, and unwanted components such as scalp and skull, in the pre-processing step. During this stage, the images are converted from gray scale to colored images for further processing. In second step, it uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) technique to extract different features from the images. In third stage, Color Moments (CMs) are used to reduce the number of features and get an optimal set of characteristics. Images with the optimal set of features are passed to different classifiers for the classification of images. The Feed Forward - ANN (FF-ANN), an individual classifier, which was given a 65% to 35% split ratio for training and testing, and hybrid classifiers called: Random Subspace with Random Forest (RSwithRF) and Random Subspace with Bayesian Network (RSwithBN), which used 10-Fold cross validation technique, resulted in 95.83%, 97.14% and 95.71% accurate classification, in corresponding order. These promising results show that the proposed method is robust and efficient, in comparison with, existing classification methods in terms of accuracy with smaller number of optimal features.;2169-3536;;;;2021;9;10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3061487;J

This study aims to improve the image quality of the short frames by utilizing information from other modality. We develop a deep learning-based joint filtering framework for simultaneously incorporating information from longer acquisition PET frames and high-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) images into the short frames. The network inputs are noisy PET images and corresponding MR images while the outputs are linear coefficients of spatially variant linear representation model. The composite of all dynamic frames is used as training label in each sample, and it is down-sampled to 1/10th of counts as the training input. L1-norm combined with two gradient-based regularizations constitute the loss function during training. Ten realistic dynamic PET/MR phantoms based on BrainWeb are used for pre-training and eleven clinical subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative further for fine-tuning. Simulation results show that the proposed method can reduce the statistical noise while preserving image details and achieve quantitative enhancements compared with Gaussian, guided filter, and convolutional neural network trained with the mean squared error.

Most previous studies have used single test scores of cognitive performance among monocentric cohorts. However, cognitive domain composite scores could be more reliable than single test scores due to the reduction of measurement error. Adopting a multicentric resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and cognitive domain approach, we provide a comprehensive description of the structural and functional correlates of the key cognitive domains of AD. Method: We analyzed MRI, rs-fMRI and cognitive domain score data of 490 participants from an interim baseline release of the multicenter DELCODE study cohort, including 54 people with AD, 86 with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), 175 with Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD), and 175 Healthy Controls (HC) in the AD-spectrum. Resulting cognitive domain composite scores (executive, visuo-spatial, memory, working memory and language) from the DELCODE neuropsychological battery (DELCODE-NP), were previously derived using confirmatory factor analysis. Statistical analyses examined the differences between diagnostic groups, and the association of composite scores with regional atrophy and network-specific functional connectivity among the patient subgroup of SCD, MCI and AD. Result: Cognitive performance, atrophy patterns and functional connectivity significantly differed between diagnostic groups in the AD-spectrum. Regional gray matter atrophy was positively associated with visuospatial and other cognitive impairments among the patient subgroup in the AD-spectrum. Except for the visual network, patterns of network-specific resting-state functional connectivity were positively associated with distinct cognitive impairments among the patient subgroup in the AD-spectrum. Conclusion: Consistent associations between cognitive domain scores and both regional atrophy and networkspecific functional connectivity (except for the visual network), support the utility of a multicentric and cognitive domain approach towards explicating the relationship between imaging markers and cognition in the AD-spectrum.;2213-1582;;;;2021;29;10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102533;J

The hippocampus is a widely studied region of interest (ROI) for a number of reasons, such as memory function analysis, stress development observation and neurological disorder investigation. Moreover, hippocampal volume atrophy is known to be linked with Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, several biomarkers, such as amyloid beta (a beta(42)) protein, tau, phosphorylated tau and hippocampal volume atrophy, are being used to diagnose AD. In this research work, we have proposed a method to diagnose AD based on slice-wise volumetric features extracted from the left and right hippocampi of structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. The proposed method is an aggregation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with a deep neural network (DNN) model. The left and right hippocampi have been localized automatically using a two-stage ensemble Hough-CNN. The localized hippocampal positions are used to extract (80 x 80x80 voxels) 3-D patches. The 2-D slices are then separated from the 3-D patches along axial, sagittal, and coronal views. The pre-processed 2-D patches are used to extract volumetric features from each slice by using a discrete volume estimation convolutional neural network (DVE-CNN) model. The extracted volumetric features have been used to train and test the classification network. The proposed approach has achieved average weighted classification accuracies of 94.82% and 94.02% based on the extracted volumetric features attributed to the left and right hippocampi, respectively. In addition, it has achieved area under the curve (AUC) values of 92.54% and 90.62% for the left and right hippocampi, respectively.

Anatomical MR images with sub-millimeter isotropic spatial resolution improve the accuracy of cortical surface and thickness estimation compared to the standard 1-millimeter isotropic resolution. Nonetheless, sub-millimeter resolution acquisitions require averaging multiple repetitions to achieve sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and are therefore long and potentially vulnerable to subject motion. We address this challenge by synthesizing sub-millimeter resolution images from standard 1-millimeter isotropic resolution images using a data-driven supervised machine learning-based super-resolution approach achieved via a deep convolutional neural network. We systematically characterize our approach using a large-scale simulated dataset and demonstrate its efficacy in empirical data. The super-resolution data provide improved cortical surfaces similar to those obtained from native sub-millimeter resolution data. The whole-brain mean absolute discrepancy in cortical surface positioning and thickness estimation is below 100 mu m at the single-subject level and below 50 mu m at the group level for the simulated data, and below 200 mu m at the single-subject level and below 100 mu m at the group level for the empirical data, making the accuracy of cortical surfaces derived from super-resolution sufficient for most applications.;1047-3211;1460-2199;;JAN;2021;31;10.1093/cercor/bhaa237;J

Due to memory constraints, many of the proposed CNNs work at a 2D slice-level or 3D patch-level. Objective: Here, we propose a subject-level 3D CNN that can extract the neurodegenerative patterns of the whole brain MRI and converted into a probabilistic Dementia score. Methods: We propose an efficient and lightweight subject-level 3D CNN featuring dilated convolutions. We trained our network on the ADNI data on stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) from stable normal controls (sNC). To comprehensively evaluate the generalizability of our proposed network, we performed four independent tests which includes testing on images from other ADNI individuals at various stages of the dementia, images acquired from other sites (AIBL), images acquired using different protocols (OASIS), and longitudinal images acquired over a short period of time (MIRIAD). Results: We achieved a 5-fold cross-validated balanced accuracy of 88% in differentiating sDAT from sNC, and an overall specificity of 79.5% and sensitivity 79.7% on the entire set of 7,902 independent test images.

CMBs can be found in people with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Alzheimer's disease, and in old individuals having a brain injury. Current research reveals that CMBs can be highly dangerous for individuals having dementia and stroke. The CMBs seriously impact individuals' life which makes it crucial to recognize the CMBs in its initial phase to stop deterioration and to assist individuals to have a normal life. The existing work report good results but often ignores false-positive's perspective for this research area. In this paper, an efficient approach is presented to detect CMBs from the Susceptibility Weighted Images (SWI). The proposed framework consists of four main phases (i) making clusters of brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) using k-mean classifier (ii) reduce false positives for better classification results (iii) discriminative feature extraction specific to CMBs (iv) classification using a five layers convolutional neural network (CNN). The proposed method is evaluated on a public dataset available for 20 subjects. The proposed system shows an accuracy of 98.9% and a 1.1% false-positive rate value. The results show the superiority of the proposed work as compared to existing states of the art methods.;1546-2218;1546-2226;;;2021;66;10.32604/cmc.2021.013966;J

Nevertheless, only part of MCI subjects could progress to AD. The main objective of this paper is thus to identify those who will develop a dementia of AD type among MCI patients. F-18-FluoroDeoxyGlucose Positron Emission Tomography (F-18-FDG PET) serves as a neuroimaging modality for early diagnosis as it can reflect neural activity via measuring glucose uptake at resting-state. In this paper, we design a deep network on F-18-FDG PET modality to address the problem of AD identification at early MCI stage. To this end, a Multi-view Separable Pyramid Network (MiSePyNet) is proposed, in which representations are learned from axial, coronal and sagittal views of PET scans so as to offer complementary information and then combined to make a decision jointly. Different from the widely and naturally used 3D convolution operations for 3D images, the proposed architecture is deployed with separable convolution from slice-wise to spatial-wise successively, which can retain the spatial information and reduce training parameters compared to 2D and 3D networks, respectively. Experiments on ADNI dataset show that the proposed method can yield better performance than both traditional and deep learning-based algorithms for predicting the progression of Mild Cognitive Impairment, with a classification accuracy of 83.05%.;0278-0062;1558-254X;;JAN;2021;40;10.1109/TMI.2020.3022591;J
"Liang, S; Gu, Y";"Liang, Shuang; Gu, Yu";Computer-Aided Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease through Weak Supervision Deep Learning Framework with Attention Mechanism;SENSORS;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most prevalent neurodegenerative disease causing dementia and poses significant health risks to middle-aged and elderly people. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most widely used diagnostic method for AD. However, it is challenging to collect sufficient brain imaging data with high-quality annotations. Weakly supervised learning (WSL) is a machine learning technique aimed at learning effective feature representation from limited or low-quality annotations. In this paper, we propose a WSL-based deep learning (DL) framework (ADGNET) consisting of a backbone network with an attention mechanism and a task network for simultaneous image classification and image reconstruction to identify and classify AD using limited annotations. The ADGNET achieves excellent performance based on six evaluation metrics (Kappa, sensitivity, specificity, precision, accuracy, F1-score) on two brain MRI datasets (2D MRI and 3D MRI data) using fine-tuning with only 20% of the labels from both datasets. The ADGNET has an F1-score of 99.61% and sensitivity is 99.69%, outperforming two state-of-the-art models (ResNext WSL and SimCLR). The proposed method represents a potential WSL-based computer-aided diagnosis method for AD in clinical practice.;;1424-8220;;JAN;2021;21;10.3390/s21010220;J
"Gutierrez-Becker, B; Sarasua, I; Wachinger, C";"Gutierrez-Becker, Benjamin; Sarasua, Ignacio; Wachinger, Christian";Discriminative and generative models for anatomical shape analysis on point clouds with deep neural networks;MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS;We introduce deep neural networks for the analysis of anatomical shapes that learn a low-dimensional shape representation from the given task, instead of relying on hand-engineered representations. Our framework is modular and consists of several computing blocks that perform fundamental shape processing tasks. The networks operate on unordered point clouds and provide invariance to similarity transformations, avoiding the need to identify point correspondences between shapes. Based on the framework, we assemble a discriminative model for disease classification and age regression, as well as a generative model for the accruate reconstruction of shapes. In particular, we propose a conditional generative model, where the condition vector provides a mechanism to control the generative process. For instance, it enables to assess shape variations specific to a particular diagnosis, when passing it as side information. Next to working on single shapes, we introduce an extension for the joint analysis of multiple anatomical structures, where the simultaneous modeling of multiple structures can lead to a more compact encoding and a better understanding of disorders. We demonstrate the advantages of our framework in comprehensive experiments on real and synthetic data. The key insights are that (i) learning a shape representation specific to the given task yields higher performance than alternative shape descriptors, (ii) multi-structure analysis is both more efficient and more accurate than single-structure analysis, and (iii) point clouds generated by our model capture morphological differences associated to Alzheimer's disease, to the point that they can be used to train a discriminative model for disease classification. Our framework naturally scales to the analysis of large datasets, giving it the potential to learn characteristic variations in large populations. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

L.";Learning patterns of the ageing brain in MRI using deep convolutional networks;NEUROIMAGE;Both normal ageing and neurodegenerative diseases cause morphological changes to the brain. Age-related brain changes are subtle, nonlinear, and spatially and temporally heterogenous, both within a subject and across a population. Machine learning models are particularly suited to capture these patterns and can produce a model that is sensitive to changes of interest, despite the large variety in healthy brain appearance. In this paper, the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the rich UK Biobank dataset, the largest database currently available, are harnessed to address the problem of predicting brain age. We developed a 3D CNN architecture to predict chronological age, using a training dataset of 12,802 T1-weighted MRI images and a further 6,885 images for testing. The proposed method shows competitive performance on age prediction, but, most importantly, the CNN prediction errors Delta(Brain Age) = Age(Predicated) - Age(True) correlated significantly with many clinical measurements from the UK Biobank in the female and male groups. In addition, having used images from only one imaging modality in this experiment, we examined the relationship between Delta(BrainAge) and the image-derived phenotypes (IDPs) from all other imaging modalities in the UK Biobank, showing correlations consistent with known patterns of ageing. Furthermore, we show that the use of nonlinearly registered images to train CNNs can lead to the network being driven by artefacts of the registration process and missing subtle indicators of ageing, limiting the clinical relevance. Due to the longitudinal aspect of the UK Biobank study, in the future it will be possible to explore whether the Delta(BrainAge) from models such as this network were predictive of any health outcomes.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;JAN 1;2021;224;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117401;J

The identification of at risk individuals allows for preventative measures to alleviate said strain. Electronic health records provide opportunity for big data analysis to address such applications. Such data however, provides a challenging problem space for traditional statistics and machine learning due to high dimensionality and sparse data elements. This article proposes a novel machine learning methodology: entropy regularization with ensemble deep neural networks (ECNN), which simultaneously provides high predictive performance of hospitalization of patients with dementia whilst enabling an interpretable heuristic analysis of the model architecture, able to identify individual features of importance within a large feature domain space. Experimental results on health records containing 54,647 features were able to identify 10 event indicators within a patient timeline: a collection of diagnostic events, medication prescriptions and procedural events, the highest ranked being essential hypertension. The resulting subset was still able to provide a highly competitive hospitalization prediction (Accuracy: 0.759) as compared to the full feature domain (Accuracy: 0.755) or traditional feature selection techniques (Accuracy: 0.737), a significant reduction in feature size. The discovery and heuristic evidence of correlation provide evidence for further clinical study of said medical events as potential novel indicators. There also remains great potential for adaption of ECNN within other medical big data domains as a data mining tool for novel risk factor identification.;2168-2372;;;;2021;9;10.1109/JTEHM.2020.3040236;J

However, it is not yet possible to easily detect these abnormalities using head computed tomography in the early stages of the disease. In this review, we evaluated the ways in which modern imaging techniques such as positron emission computed tomography, single photon emission tomography, magnetic resonance spectrum imaging, structural magnetic resonance imaging, magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging, magnetic resonance perfusion weighted imaging, magnetic resonance sensitive weighted imaging, and functional magnetic resonance imaging have revealed specific changes not only in brain structure, but also in brain function in Alzheimer's disease patients. The reviewed literature indicated that decreased fluorodeoxyglucose metabolism in the temporal and parietal lobes of Alzheimer's disease patients is frequently observed via positron emission computed tomography. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's disease often show a decreased N-acetylaspartic acid/creatine ratio and an increased myoinositol/creatine ratio revealed via magnetic resonance imaging. Atrophy of the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate gyrus can be detected early using structural magnetic resonance imaging. Magnetic resonance sensitive weighted imaging can show small bleeds and abnormal iron metabolism. Task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging can display brain function activity through cerebral blood oxygenation. Resting functional magnetic resonance imaging can display the functional connection between brain neural networks. These are helpful for the differential diagnosis and experimental study of Alzheimer's disease, and are valuable for exploring the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.;1673-5374;1876-7958;;JAN;2021;16;10.4103/1673-5374.286957;J

Many clinical trials of potential therapies for AD have failed, and there is currently no approved disease-modifying treatment. Biomarkers for early detection and mechanistic understanding of disease course are critical for drug development and clinical trials. Amyloid has been the focus of most biomarker research. Here, we developed a deep learning-based framework to identify informative features for AD classification using tau positron emission tomography (PET) scans. Results The 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based classification model of AD from cognitively normal (CN) yielded an average accuracy of 90.8% based on five-fold cross-validation. The LRP model identified the brain regions in tau PET images that contributed most to the AD classification from CN. The top identified regions included the hippocampus, parahippocampus, thalamus, and fusiform. The layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) results were consistent with those from the voxel-wise analysis in SPM12, showing significant focal AD associated regional tau deposition in the bilateral temporal lobes including the entorhinal cortex. The AD probability scores calculated by the classifier were correlated with brain tau deposition in the medial temporal lobe in MCI participants (r = 0.43 for early MCI and r = 0.49 for late MCI). Conclusion A deep learning framework combining 3D CNN and LRP algorithms can be used with tau PET images to identify informative features for AD classification and may have application for early detection during prodromal stages of AD.;1471-2105;;;DEC 28;2020;21;10.1186/s12859-020-03848-0;J

In this study, we developed a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based AD classification algorithm using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans from AD patients and age/gender-matched cognitively normal controls from two populations that differ in ethnicity and education level. These populations come from the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital (SNUBH) and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each population, we trained CNNs on five subsets using coronal slices of T1-weighted images that cover the medial temporal lobe. We evaluated the models on validation subsets from both the same population (within-dataset validation) and other population (between-dataset validation).

Methods This is a clinicopathologic case-control study of 45 patients, including 20 prospectively recruited patients with LPA among whom 6 were diagnosed with LPA-DLBD. We analyzed clinical features and compared FDG-PET metabolism in LPA-DLBD to an independent group of patients with clinical pDLB and regional alpha-synuclein burden on digital pathology to a second independent group of autopsied patients with DLBD pathology and antemortem pDLB (DLB-DLBD). Results All patients with LPA-DLBD were men. Neurological, speech, and neuropsychological characteristics were similar across LPA-DLBD, LPA-Alzheimer's disease (LPA-AD), and LPA-frontotemporal lobar degeneration (LPA-FTLD). Genetic screening of AD, DLBD, and FTLD linked genes were negative with the exception of APOE epsilon 4 allele present in 83% of LPA-DLBD patients. Seventy-five percent of the patients with LPA-DLBD showed a parietal-dominant pattern of hy pometabolism; LPA-FTLD - temporal-dominant pattern, whereas LPA-AD showed heterogeneous patterns of hypometabolism. LPA-DLBD had more asymmetrical hypometabolism affecting frontal lobes, with relatively spared occipital lobe in the nondominantly affected hemisphere, compared to pDLB. LPA-DLBD had minimal atrophy on gross brain examination, higher cortical Lewy body counts, and higher alpha-synuclein burden in the middle frontal and inferior parietal cortices compared to DLB-DLBD. Interpretation Whereas AD is the most frequent underlying pathology of LPA, DLBD can also be present and may contribute to the LPA phenotype possibly due to alpha-synuclein-associated functional impairment of the dominant parietal lobe.

This model was constructed based on the effects of systemic metabolic disorders on cognitive function. Methods: We employed a deep neural network (DNN) to predict cognitive function based on subject's age and blood test items (23 items). We included 202 patients (73.48 +/- 13.1 years) with various systemic metabolic disorders for training of the DNN model, and the following groups for validation of the model: (1) Patient group, 65 patients (73.6 +/- 11.0 years) who were hospitalized for rehabilitation after stroke; (2) Healthy group, 37 subjects (62.0 +/- 8.6 years); (3) Health examination group, 165 subjects (54.0 +/- 8.6 years) admitted for a health examination. The subjects underwent the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE). Results: There were significant positive correlations between the predicted MMSE scores and ground truth scores in the Patient and Healthy groups (r = 0.66, p < 0.001). There were no significant differences between the predicted MMSE scores and ground truth scores in the Patient group (p > 0.05); however, in the Healthy group, the predicted MMSE scores were slightly, but significantly, lower than the ground truth scores (p < 0.05). In the Health examination group, the DNN model classified 94 subjects as normal (MMSE = 27-30), 67 subjects as having mild cognitive impairment (24-26), and four subjects as having dementia (<= 23).

In contrast, in the subjects with neurological disorders, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage, the ground truth MMSE scores were lower than the predicted scores. Conclusions: The DNN model could predict cognitive function accurately. The predicted MMSE scores were significantly lower than the ground truth scores in the Healthy and Health examination groups, while there was no significant difference in the Patient group. We suggest that the difference between the predicted and ground truth MMSE scores was caused by changes in atherosclerosis with aging, and that applying the DNN model to younger subjects may predict future cognitive impairment after the onset of atherosclerosis.";1664-2295;;;DEC 14;2020;11;10.3389/fneur.2020.588140;J

According to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) privacy rules, full-face photographic images and any comparable image are direct identifiers and considered as protected health information. Moreover, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) categorizes facial images as biometric data and stipulates that special restrictions should be placed on the processing of biometric data. Objective: This study aimed to develop software that can remove the header information from Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) format files and facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) at the 2D sliced-image level to anonymize personal information in medical images. Methods: A total of 240 cranial magnetic resonance (MR) images were used to train the deep learning model (144, 48, and 48 for the training, validation, and test sets, respectively, from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative [ADNI] database). To overcome the small sample size problem, we used a data augmentation technique to create 576 images per epoch. We used attention-gated U-net for the basic structure of our deep learning model. To validate the performance of the software, we adapted an external test set comprising 100 cranial MR images from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. Results: The facial features (eyes, nose, and ears) were successfully detected and anonymized in both test sets (48 from ADNI and 100 from OASIS). Each result was manually validated in both the 2D image plane and the 3D-rendered images. Furthermore, the ADNI test set was verified using Microsoft Azure's face recognition artificial intelligence service. By adding a user interface, we developed and distributed (via GitHub) software named Deface program for medical images as an open-source project. Conclusions: We developed deep learning-based software for the anonymization of MR images that distorts the eyes, nose, and ears to prevent facial identification of the subject in reconstructed 3D images.

Methods One hundred one participants underwent PIB and FDG PET during life and neuropathological assessment. PET scans were visually interpreted by 3 raters blinded to clinical information. PIB PET was rated as positive or negative for cortical retention, whereas FDG scans were read as showing an Alzheimer disease (AD) or non-AD pattern. Neuropathological diagnoses were assigned using research criteria. Majority visual reads were compared to intermediate-high AD neuropathological change (ADNC). Results One hundred one participants were included (mean age = 67.2 years, 41 females, Mini-Mental State Examination = 21.9, PET-to-autopsy interval = 4.4 years). At autopsy, 32 patients showed primary AD, 56 showed non-AD neuropathology (primarily frontotemporal lobar degeneration [FTLD]), and 13 showed mixed AD/FTLD pathology. PIB showed higher sensitivity than FDG for detecting intermediate-high ADNC (96%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 89-100% vs 80%, 95% CI = 68-92%, p = 0.02), but equivalent specificity (86%, 95% CI = 76-95% vs 84%, 95% CI = 74-93%, p = 0.80). In patients with congruent PIB and FDG reads (77/101), combined sensitivity was 97% (95% CI = 92-100%) and specificity was 98% (95% CI = 93-100%). Nine of 24 patients with incongruent reads were found to have co-occurrence of AD and non-AD pathologies. Interpretation In our sample enriched for younger onset cognitive impairment, PIB-PET had higher sensitivity than FDG-PET for intermediate-high ADNC, with similar specificity. When both modalities are congruent, sensitivity and specificity approach 100%, whereas mixed pathology should be considered when PIB and FDG are incongruent.

"Sivakumar, V; Janakiraman, N";"Sivakumar, V; Janakiraman, N.";A novel method for segmenting brain tumor using modified watershed algorithm in MRI image with FPGA;BIOSYSTEMS;The goal of the segmentation of brain images is to separate the images in different non-compatible homogenous areas reflecting the numerous anatomical structures. Brain segmentation by magnetic resonance has numerous implications for diagnosing brain disorganizations such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson-related syndrome among others. However, it is not an simple job to automatically segment the MR image. The main motive of this study is to provide a better segmentation approach for the segment of the ROI (Region Of Interest) region from the MRI image by solving the issues that currently exist in the literary works. MRI segmentation is not a trivial task, because acquired MR images are imperfect and are often corrupted by noise and other image artifacts. The variety in technologies for image processing has contributed to the creation in numerous image segmentation techniques. That is because there is no universal approach, nor are all methods necessarily appropriate for a specific form of picture suitable for all pictures. Other approaches still use the gray level histogram, for example, while others integrate detailed spatial picture details for bleeding conditions. Some methods use statistical techniques, but some do incorporate existing information to enhance segmentation efficiency. Some methods utilize probabilistic or fuzzy methods. Yet there are certain inconveniences of all the current processes. Therefore, we have intended to propose a new segmentation approach for the ROI region segmentation. The proposed work comprised of three phases namely preprocessing, edge detection and segmentation. At first, the MRI images are extracted from the database and that each of the input images is enhanced by applying a high pass filter. After completing the preprocessing method, the enhanced canny edge detection (ECED) approach is used to enhance the image. After that, the images are given to the modified watershed segmentation (MWS) algorithm which separates the ROI part from MRI Image. The testing consequences demonstrate that the proposed system accomplishes to give the good result related to the available strategies.

Multi-modal imaging such as structural MRI and DTI provide useful information for the classification of patients on the basis of brain biomarkers. Recently, CNN methods have emerged as powerful tools to improve classification using images. New Method: In this paper, we propose a transfer learning scheme using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to automatically classify brain scans focusing only on a small ROI: e.g. a few slices of the hippocampal region. The network's architecture is similar to a LeNet-like CNN upon which models are built and fused for AD stage classification diagnosis. We evaluated various types of transfer learning through the following mechanisms: (i) cross-modal (sMRI and DTI) and (ii) cross-domain transfer learning (using MNIST) (iii) a hybrid transfer learning of both types. Results: Our method shows good performances even on small datasets and with a limited number of slices of small brain region. It increases accuracy with more than 5 points for the most difficult classification tasks, i.e., AD/MCI and MCI/NC. Comparison with Existing Method(s): Our methodology provides good accuracy scores for classification over a shallow convolutional network. Besides, we focused only on a small region; i.e., the hippocampal region, where few slices are selected to feed the network. Also, we used cross-modal transfer learning. Conclusions: Our proposed method is suitable for working with a shallow CNN network for low-resolution MRI and DTI scans. It yields to significant results even if the model is trained on small datasets, which is often the case in medical image analysis.";2405-8440;;;DEC;2020;6;10.1016/j.heliyon.2020.e05652;J

At the same time, advances in information and sensor technologies have reduced caring costs, providing a potential pathway for developing healthcare services for AD patients. For instance, if a virtual reality (VR) system can provide emotion-adaptive content, the time that AD patients spend interacting with VR content is expected to be extended, allowing caregivers to focus on other tasks. As the first step towards this goal, in this study, we develop a classification model that detects AD patients' emotions (e.g., happy, peaceful, or bored). We first collected electroencephalography (EEG) data from 30 Korean female AD patients who watched emotion-evoking videos at a medical rehabilitation center. We applied conventional machine learning algorithms, such as a multilayer perceptron (MLP) and support vector machine, along with deep learning models of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures.

Such scarcity partially stems from the lack of automated segmentation tools, since manual delineation suffers from scalability and reproducibility issues. Due to the small size of the hypothalamus and the lack of image contrast in its vicinity, automated segmentation is difficult and has been long neglected by widespread neuroimaging packages like FreeSurfer or FSL. Nonetheless, recent advances in deep machine learning are enabling us to tackle difficult segmentation problems with high accuracy. In this paper we present a fully automated tool based on a deep convolutional neural network, for the segmentation of the whole hypothalamus and its subregions from T1-weighted MRI scans. We use aggressive data augmentation in order to make the model robust to T1-weighted MR scans from a wide array of different sources, without any need for preprocessing. We rigorously assess the performance of the presented tool through extensive analyses, including: inter- and intra-rater variability experiments between human observers; comparison of our tool with manual segmentation; comparison with an automated method based on multi-atlas segmentation; assessment of robustness by quality control analysis of a larger, heterogeneous dataset (ADNI); and indirect evaluation with a volumetric study performed on ADNI. The presented model outperforms multi-atlas segmentation scores as well as inter-rater accuracy level, and approaches intra-rater precision.

Extensive effort has been devoted to improving fMRI data quality, but in the last two decades, there is no consensus reached which technique is more effective. In this study, we developed a novel deep neural network for denoising fMRI data, named denoising neural network (DeNN). This deep neural network is 1) applicable without requiring externally recorded data to model noise; 2) spatially and temporally adaptive to the variability of noise in different brain regions at different time points; 3) automated to output denoised data without manual interference; 4) trained and applied on each subject separately and 5) insensitive to the repetition time (TR) of fMRI data. When we compared DeNN with a number of nuisance regression methods for denoising fMRI data from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, only DeNN had connectivity for functionally uncorrelated regions close to zero and successfully identified unbiased correlations between the posterior cingulate cortex seed and multiple brain regions within the default mode network or task positive network.

However, DL models in medical imaging are often trained on public research cohorts with images acquired with a single scanner or with strict protocol harmonization, which is not representative of a clinical setting. The aim of this study was to investigate how well a DL model performs in unseen clinical datasets-collected with different scanners, protocols and disease populations-and whether more heterogeneous training data improves generalization. In total, 3117 MRI scans of brains from multiple dementia research cohorts and memory clinics, that had been visually rated by a neuroradiologist according to Scheltens' scale of medial temporal atrophy (MTA), were included in this study. By training multiple versions of a convolutional neural network on different subsets of this data to predict MTA ratings, we assessed the impact of including images from a wider distribution during training had on performance in external memory clinic data. Our results showed that our model generalized well to datasets acquired with similar protocols as the training data, but substantially worse in clinical cohorts with visibly different tissue contrasts in the images. This implies that future DL studies investigating performance in out-of-distribution (OOD) MRI data need to assess multiple external cohorts for reliable results. Further, by including data from a wider range of scanners and protocols the performance improved in OOD data, which suggests that more heterogeneous training data makes the model generalize better. To conclude, this is the most comprehensive study to date investigating the domain shift in deep learning on MRI data, and we advocate rigorous evaluation of DL models on clinical data prior to being certified for deployment.

We propose an adaptive weighted integrated convolutional neural network (AWI-CNN) to effectively identify patients with Alzheimer's disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment in this paper. The research data used in this paper are T1-weighted images from ADNI. First, after pre-processing, we obtained the grey matter images of the same individual in the corona! plane, axial plane, and sagittal plane. Second, we use the improved convolution neural network to train and recognize the three planes. We are using the idea of group decision making to adaptive weighted voting of three planes obtained from Softmax layer. Finally, using the technology of integrated learning, the data of different planes are integrated to obtain the final recognition accuracy.

Recent studies show great promises for improving the performance of EMCI identification by combining multiple structural and functional features, such as grey matter volume and shortest path length. However, extracting which features and how to combine multiple features to improve the performance of EMCI identification have always been a challenging problem. To address this problem, in this study we propose a new EMCI identification framework using multi-modal data and graph convolutional networks (GCNs). Firstly, we extract grey matter volume and shortest path length of each brain region based on automated anatomical labeling (AAL) atlas as feature representation from T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data of each subject, respectively. Then, in order to obtain features that are more helpful in identifying EMCI, a common multi-task feature selection method is applied. Afterwards, we construct a non-fully labelled subject graph using imaging and non-imaging phenotypic measures of each subject. Finally, a GCN model is adopted to perform the EMCI identification task.ResultsOur proposed EMCI identification method is evaluated on 210 subjects, including 105 subjects with EMCI and 105 normal controls (NCs), with both T1w MRI and rs-fMRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that our proposed framework achieves an accuracy of 84.1% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.856 for EMCI/NC classification. In addition, by comparison, the accuracy and AUC values of our proposed framework are better than those of some existing methods in EMCI identification.ConclusionOur proposed EMCI identification framework is effective and promising for automatic diagnosis of EMCI in clinical practice.;1471-2105;;;NOV 18;2020;21;10.1186/s12859-020-3437-6;J

In combined PET/MRI, AC is challenged by the lack of bone signal in the MRI from which the AC maps has to be derived. Deep learning-based image-to-image translation networks present itself as an optimal solution for MRI-derived AC (MR-AC). High robustness and generalizability of these networks are expected to be achieved through large training cohorts. In this study, we implemented an MR-AC method based on deep learning, and investigated how training cohort size, transfer learning, and MR input affected robustness, and subsequently evaluated the method in a clinical setup, with the overall aim to explore if this method could be implemented in clinical routine for PET/MRI examinations. Methods: A total cohort of 1037 adult subjects from the Siemens Biograph mMR with two different software versions (VB20P and VE11P) was used. The software upgrade included updates to all MRI sequences. The impact of training group size was investigated by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) on an increasing training group size from 10 to 403. The ability to adapt to changes in the input images between software versions were evaluated using transfer learning from a large cohort to a smaller cohort, by varying training group size from 5 to 91 subjects. The impact of MRI sequence was evaluated by training three networks based on the Dixon VIBE sequence (DeepDixon), T1-weighted MPRAGE (DeepT1), and ultra-short echo time (UTE) sequence (DeepUTE). Blinded clinical evaluation relative to the reference low-dose CT (CT-AC) was performed for DeepDixon in 104 independent 2-[F-18]fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ([F-18]FDG) PET patient studies performed for suspected neurodegenerative disorder using statistical surface projections. Results: Robustness increased with group size in the training data set: 100 subjects were required to reduce the number of outliers compared to a state-of-the-art segmentation-based method, and a cohort >400 subjects further increased robustness in terms of reduced variation and number of outliers. When using transfer learning to adapt to changes in the MRI input, as few as five subjects were sufficient to minimize outliers. Full robustness was achieved at 20 subjects. Comparable robust and accurate results were obtained using all three types of MRI input with a bias below 1% relative to CT-AC in any brain region. The clinical PET evaluation using DeepDixon showed no clinically relevant differences compared to CT-AC. Conclusion: Deep learning based AC requires a large training cohort to achieve accurate and robust performance. Using transfer learning, only five subjects were needed to fine-tune the method to large changes to the input images. No clinically relevant differences were found compared to CT-AC, indicating that clinical implementation of our deep learning-based MR-AC method will be feasible across MRI system types using transfer learning and a limited number of subjects.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NOV 15;2020;222;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117221;J

In this study, given multimodal AD markers and clinical diagnosis of an individual from one or more timepoints, we seek to predict the clinical diagnosis, cognition and ventricular volume of the individual for every month (indefinitely) into the future. We proposed and applied a minimal recurrent neural network (minimalRNN) model to data from The Alzheimer's Disease Prediction Of Longitudinal Evolution (TADPOLE) challenge, comprising longitudinal data of 1677 participants (Marinescu et al., 2018) from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We compared the performance of the minimalRNN model and four baseline algorithms up to 6 years into the future. Most previous work on predicting AD progression ignore the issue of missing data, which is a prevalent issue in longitudinal data. Here, we explored three different strategies to handle missing data. Two of the strategies treated the missing data as a preprocessing issue, by imputing the missing data using the previous timepoint (forward filling) or linear interpolation (linear filling). The third strategy utilized the minimalRNN model itself to fill in the missing data both during training and testing (model filling). Our analyses suggest that the minimalRNN with model filling compared favorably with baseline algorithms, including support vector machine/regression, linear state space (LSS) model, and long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Importantly, although the training procedure utilized longitudinal data, we found that the trained minimalRNN model exhibited similar performance, when using only 1 input timepoint or 4 input timepoints, suggesting that our approach might work well with just cross-sectional data.

It enhances image quality by retaining specific features to improve the clinical applicability of medical imaging for treatment and evaluation of medical conditions. A big challenge in the processing of medical images is to incorporate the pathological features of the complement into one image. The fused image presents various challenges, such as existence of fusion artifacts, hardness of the base, comparison of medical image input, and computational cost. The techniques of hybrid multimodal medical image fusion (HMMIF) have been designed for pathologic studies, such as neurocysticercosis, degenerative and neoplastic diseases. Two domain algorithms based on HMMIF techniques have been developed in this research for various medical image fusion applications for MRI-SPECT, MRI-PET, and MRI-CT. NSCT is initially used in the proposed method to decompose the input images which give components of low and high frequency. The average fusion rule applies to NSCT components with low frequency. The NSCT high frequency components are fused by the law of full fusion. NSCTs high frequency is handled with directed image filtration scheme. The fused picture is obtained by taking inverse transformations from all frequency bands with the coefficients obtained from them.

In addition to biological considerations (eg, genetic influences and comorbid disorders), social and environmental factors may increase the risk of AD dementia. This paper (1) assesses neuroimaging biomarkers of amyloid (A), tau (T), and neurodegeneration (N) for potential racial differences and (2) considers mediating effects of socioeconomic status (SES) and measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease on observed race differences. Methods Imaging measures of AT(N) (amyloid and tau positron emission tomography [PET]) structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) were collected from African American (n = 131) and white (n = 685) cognitively normal participants age 45 years and older. Measures of small vessel and cardiovascular disease (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] on MRI, blood pressure, and body mass index [BMI]) and area-based SES were included in mediation analyses. Results Compared to white participants, African American participants had greater neurodegeneration, as measured by decreased cortical volumes (Cohen's f(2) = 0.05, p < 0.001). SES mediated the relationship between race and cortical volumes. There were no significant race effects for amyloid, tau, or rs-fc signature. Interpretation Modifiable factors, such as differences in social contexts and resources, particularly area-level SES, may contribute to observed racial differences in AD. Future studies should emphasize collection of relevant psychosocial factors in addition to the development of intentional diversity and inclusion efforts to improve the racial/ethnic and socioeconomic representativeness of AD studies.

In this paper, we evaluated the potential of ensemble transfer-learning techniques, pretrained on generic images and then transferred to structural brain MRI, for the early diagnosis and prognosis of AD, with respect to a fusion of conventional-ML approaches based on Support Vector Machine directly applied to structural brain MRI. Specifically, more than 600 subjects were obtained from the ADNI repository, including AD, Mild Cognitive Impaired converting to AD (MCIc), Mild Cognitive Impaired not converting to AD (MCInc), and cognitively-normal (CN) subjects. We used T1-weighted cerebral-MRI studies to train: (1) an ensemble of five transfer-learning architectures pretrained on generic images; (2) a 3D Convolutional Neutral Network (CNN) trained from scratch on MRI volumes; and (3) a fusion of two conventional-ML classifiers derived from different feature extraction/selection techniques coupled to SVM.

The ensemble transfer-learning approach was able to effectively discriminate AD from CN with 90.2% AUC, MCIc from CN with 83.2% AUC, and MCIc from MCInc with 70.6% AUC, showing comparable or slightly lower results with the fusion of conventional-ML systems (AD from CN with 93.1% AUC, MCIc from CN with 89.6% AUC, and MCIc from MCInc with AUC in the range of 69.1-73.3%). The deep-learning network trained from scratch obtained lower performance than either the fusion of conventional-ML systems and the ensemble transfer-learning, due to the limited sample of images used for training.

This task remains tremendously challenging due to the limited data and the difficulties in detecting mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Existing methods use gait [or EEG (electroencephalogram)] data only to tackle this task. Although the gait data acquisition procedure is cheap and simple, the methods relying on gait data often fail to detect the slight difference between MCI and AD. The methods that use EEG data can detect the difference more precisely, but collecting EEG data from both HC (health controls) and patients is very time-consuming. More critically, these methods often convert EEG records into the frequency domain and thus inevitably lose the spatial and temporal information, which is essential to capture the connectivity and synchronization among different brain regions. This paper proposes a cascade neural network with two steps to achieve a faster and more accurate AD classification by exploiting gait and EEG data simultaneously. In the first step, we propose attention-based spatial temporal graph convolutional networks to extract the features from the skeleton sequences (i.e., gait) captured by Kinect (a commonly used sensor) to distinguish between HC and patients. In the second step, we propose spatial temporal convolutional networks to fully exploit the spatial and temporal information of EEG data and classify the patients into MCI or AD eventually. We collect gait and EEG data from 35 cognitively health controls, 35 MCI, and 17 AD patients to evaluate our proposed method. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms other AD diagnosis methods (91.07 vs. 68.18%) in the three-way AD classification task (HC, MCI, and AD). Moreover, we empirically found that the lower body and right upper limb are more important for the early diagnosis of AD than other body parts.

Methods An efficient approach to diagnosis Alzheimer's disease from brain MRI scans is proposed comprising two phases: I) segmentation and II) classification, both based on deep learning. After the brain tissues are segmented by a model that combines Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), a new model combining Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) is used to classify Alzheimer's disease based on the segmented tissues. Results We present two evaluations for segmentation and classification. For comparison, the new method was evaluated using the AD-86 and AD-126 datasets leading to Dice 0.96 for segmentation in both datasets and accuracies 0.88, and 0.80 for classification, respectively. Conclusion Deep learning gives prominent results for segmentation and feature extraction in medical image processing. The combination of XGboost and SVM improves the results obtained.;0020-7454;1563-5279;;;;;10.1080/00207454.2020.1835900;J

To address this challenge, we propose a new MCI detection framework based on multi-atlas multi-view hybrid graph convolutional networks and ensemble learning. We first construct nine different graphs based on three brain atlases and three morphological measurements using both imaging and non-imaging data of each subject. Then, in order to integrate the information of different graphs and obtain more discriminative feature representations for detecting MCI, we propose a hybrid graph convolutional network method. Finally, a new ensemble learning method is proposed to perform MCI detection tasks. An evaluation of our proposed framework has been conducted with 369 subjects with cognitively normal (CN), 779 subjects with MCI including 310 subjects with EMCI and 469 subjects with LMCI, and 301 subjects with AD on three classification tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed framework can get an accuracy of 90.8% and an AUC of 0.932 for MCI/CN classification, an accuracy of 88.6% and an AUC of 0.908 for MCI/AD classification, and an accuracy of 83.5% and an AUC of 0.851 for EMCI/LMCI classification, respectively. Compared with some state-of-the-art methods about MCI detection, our proposed framework can get better performance. Overall, our proposed framework is effective and promising for MCI detection in clinical practice.;1386-7857;1573-7543;;MAR;2021;24;10.1007/s10586-020-03199-8;J

Recently, the spatially localized atlas network tiles (SLANT) can effectively segment whole brain, non-contrast T1w MRI with 132 volumetric labels. Transfer learning (TL) is a commonly used domain adaptation tool to update the neural network weights for local factors, yet risks degradation of performance on the original validation/test cohorts. Approach: We explore TL using unlabeled clinical data to address these concerns in the context of adapting SLANT to scanning protocol variations. We optimize whole-brain segmentation on heterogeneous clinical data by leveraging 480 unlabeled pairs of clinically acquired T1w MRI with and without intravenous contrast. We use labels generated on the pre-contrast image to train on the post-contrast image in a five-fold cross-validation framework. We further validated on a withheld test set of 29 paired scans over a different acquisition domain. Results: Using TL, we improve reproducibility across imaging pairs measured by the reproducibility Dice coefficient (rDSC) between the pre- and post-contrast image. We showed an increase over the original SLANT algorithm (rDSC 0.82 versus 0.72) and the FreeSurfer v6.0.1 segmentation pipeline (rDSC = 0.53). We demonstrate the impact of this work decreasing the root-mean-squared error of volumetric estimates of the hippocampus between paired images of the same subject by 67%. Conclusion: This work demonstrates a pipeline for unlabeled clinical data to translate algorithms optimized for research data to generalize toward heterogeneous clinical acquisitions.

"Mill, RD; Gordon, BA; Balota, DA; Cole, MW";"Mill, Ravi D.; Gordon, Brian A.; Balota, David A.; Cole, Michael W.";Predicting dysfunctional age-related task activations from resting-state network alterations;NEUROIMAGE;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is linked to changes in fMRI task activations and fMRI resting-state functional connectivity (restFC), which can emerge early in the illness timecourse. These fMRI correlates of unhealthy aging have been studied in largely separate subfields. Taking inspiration from neural network simulations, we propose a unifying mechanism wherein restFC alterations associated with AD disrupt the flow of activations between brain regions, leading to aberrant task activations. We apply this activity flow model in a large sample of clinically normal older adults, which was segregated into healthy (low-risk) and at-risk subgroups based on established imaging (positron emission tomography amyloid) and genetic (apolipoprotein) AD risk factors. Modeling the flow of healthy activations over at-risk AD connectivity effectively transformed the healthy aged activations into unhealthy (at-risk) aged activations. This enabled reliable prediction of at-risk AD task activations, and these predicted activations were related to individual differences in task behavior. These results support activity flow over altered intrinsic functional connections as a mechanism underlying Alzheimer's-related dysfunction, even in very early stages of the illness. Beyond these mechanistic insights, this approach raises clinical potential by enabling prediction of task activations and associated cognitive dysfunction in individuals without requiring them to perform in-scanner cognitive tasks.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NOV 1;2020;221;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117167;J

Thirty-eight patients with MCI stratified into high and low quality of sleep in accordance with a self-reported questionnaire for sleep habits, and 38 controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Independent component analysis was used to reconstruct the default mode network and frontoparietal network (FPN). High quality of sleep was associated with increased FPN connectivity among patients with MCI. Moreover, a positive coupling of connectivity between networks was found in MCI reporting high quality of sleep, congruently with the pattern observed in controls, whereas this coupling was disrupted in MCI with low quality of sleep. An association between FPN connectivity and language scores was observed in MCI. These findings suggest a relationship between sleep quality and FPN connectivity in MCI that may underlie compensatory mechanisms to overcome advancing neurodegeneration. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc.

New method: In this study, brain connections in Resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Rs-fMRI) of ASD and Typical Developing (TD) are analyzed by partial and full correlation methods such as Gaussian Graphical Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (GLASSO), Max-Det Matrix Completion (MDMC), and Pearson Correlation Co-Efficient (PCCE). We investigated Functional Connectivity (FC) of ASD and TD brain from 238 functionally defined regions of interest. Furthermore, we constructed a series of feature sets by applying conditional random forests and conditional permutation importance. We built classifier models by Random Forest (RF), Oblique RF (ORF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for each feature set. FC features are ranked based on p-value and we analyzed the top 20 FC features. Results: We achieved a single-trial test accuracy of 72.5 %, though MDMC-SVM and PCCE-CNN pipelines. Further, PCCE-CNN pipeline gives better average test accuracy (70.31 %) and area under the curve (0.73) compared to other pipelines. We found that top-20 PCCE based FC features are from networks such as Dorsal Attention (DA), Cingulo-Opercular Task Control (COTC), somatosensory motor hand and subcortical. In addition, among top 20 PCCE features, many FC links are found between COTC and DA (4 connections) which helped to discriminate the ASD and TD.

Although there is currently no cure, it is possible to treat symptoms of dementia. Early diagnosis is paramount to the development and success of interventions, and neuroimaging represents one of the most promising areas for early detection of AD. We aimed to deploy advanced deep learning methods to determine whether they can extract useful AD biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) and classify brain images into AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) groups. We tailored and trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on sMRIs of the brain from datasets available in online databases. Our proposed method, ADNet, was evaluated on the CADDementia challenge and outperformed several approaches in the prior art. The method's configuration with machine-learning domain adaptation, ADNet-DA, reached 52.3% accuracy. Contributions of our study include devising a deep learning system that is entirely automatic and comparatively fast, presenting competitive results without using any patient's domain-specific knowledge about the disease. We were able to implement an end-to-end CNN system to classify subjects into AD, MCI, or CN groups, reflecting the identification of distinctive elements in brain images. In this context, our system represents a promising tool in finding biomarkers to help with the diagnosis of AD and, eventually, many other diseases.;2296-4185;;;OCT 30;2020;8;10.3389/fbioe.2020.534592;J

This decline in navigational capabilities has traditionally been ascribed to memory impairments and dysexecutive function, whereas the impact of visual aging has often been overlooked. The ability to perceive visuospatial information such as salient landmarks is essential to navigating efficiently. To date, the functional and neurobiological factors underpinning landmark processing in aging remain insufficiently characterized. To address this issue, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the brain activity associated with landmark-based navigation in young and healthy older participants. The performances of 25 young adults (mu = 25.4 years, sigma = 2.7; seven females) and 17 older adults (mu = 73.0 years, sigma = 3.9; 10 females) were assessed in a virtual-navigation task in which they had to orient using salient landmarks. The underlying whole-brain patterns of activity as well as the functional roles of specific cerebral regions involved in landmark processing, namely the parahippocampal place area (PPA), the occipital place area (OPA), and the retrosplenial cortex (RSC), were analyzed. Older adults' navigational abilities were overall diminished compared to young adults. Also, the two age groups relied on distinct navigational strategies to solve the task. Better performances during landmark-based navigation were associated with increased neural activity in an extended neural network comprising several cortical and cerebellar regions. Direct comparisons between age groups revealed that young participants had greater anterior temporal activity. Also, only young adults showed significant activity in occipital areas corresponding to the cortical projection of the central visual field during landmark-based navigation. The region-of-interest analysis revealed an increased OPA activation in older adult participants during the landmark condition. There were no significant between-group differences in PPA and RSC activations. These preliminary results hint at the possibility that aging diminishes fine-grained information processing in occipital and temporal regions, thus hindering the capacity to use landmarks adequately for navigation. Keeping sight of its exploratory nature, this work helps towards a better comprehension of the neural dynamics subtending landmark-based navigation and it provides new insights on the impact of age-related visuospatial processing differences on navigation capabilities.";1662-5161;;;OCT 29;2020;14;10.3389/fnhum.2020.552111;J

Because cortical regions are close to bone, quantitation accuracy of amyloid and tau PET imaging can be significantly influenced by errors of attenuation correction (AC). This work presents an MR-based AC method that combines deep learning with a novel ultrashort time-to-echo (UTE)/multi-echo Dixon (mUTE) sequence for amyloid and tau imaging. Methods Thirty-five subjects that underwent both 11C-PiB and 18F-MK6240 scans were included in this study. The proposed method was compared with Dixon-based atlas method as well as magnetization-prepared rapid acquisition with gradient echo (MPRAGE)- or Dixon-based deep learning methods. The Dice coefficient and validation loss of the generated pseudo-CT images were used for comparison. PET error images regarding standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) were quantified through regional and surface analysis to evaluate the final AC accuracy. Results The Dice coefficients of the deep learning methods based on MPRAGE, Dixon, and mUTE images were 0.84 (0.91), 0.84 (0.92), and 0.87 (0.94) for the whole-brain (above-eye) bone regions, respectively, higher than the atlas method of 0.52 (0.64). The regional SUVR error for the atlas method was around 6%, higher than the regional SUV error. The regional SUV and SUVR errors for all deep learning methods were below 2%, with mUTE-based deep learning method performing the best. As for the surface analysis, the atlas method showed the largest error (> 10%) near vertices inside superior frontal, lateral occipital, superior parietal, and inferior temporal cortices. The mUTE-based deep learning method resulted in the least number of regions with error higher than 1%, with the largest error (> 5%) showing up near the inferior temporal and medial orbitofrontal cortices.

Due to their similar clinical symptoms, they are easily misdiagnosed as each other even with sophisticated clinical guidelines. For disease-specific intervention and treatment, it is essential to develop a computer-aided system to improve the accuracy of their differential diagnosis. Recent advances in deep learning have delivered some of the best performance for medical image recognition tasks. However, its application to the differential diagnosis of AD and FTD pathology has not been explored. Approach: In this study, we proposed a novel deep learning based framework to distinguish between brain images of normal aging individuals and subjects with AD and FTD. Specifically, we combined the multi-scale and multi-type MRI-base image features with Generative Adversarial Network data augmentation technique to improve the differential diagnosis accuracy. Results: Each of the multi-scale, multitype, and data augmentation methods improved the ability for differential diagnosis for both AD and FTD. A 10-fold cross validation experiment performed on a large sample of 1,954 images using the proposed framework achieved a high overall accuracy of 88.28%. Conclusions: The salient contributions of this study are three-fold: (1) our experiments demonstrate that the combination of multiple structural features extracted at different scales with our proposed deep neural network yields superior performance than individual features; (2) we show that the use of Generative Adversarial Network for data augmentation could further improve the discriminant ability of the network regarding challenging tasks such as differentiating dementia sub-types; (3) and finally, we show that ensemble classifier strategy could make the network more robust and stable.";;1662-453X;;OCT 22;2020;14;10.3389/fnins.2020.00853;J

As a chronic progressive disease, diabetes mellitus (DM) has a high incidence worldwide, and it impacts on cognitive and learning abilities in the lifetime even in the early stage, may degenerate memory in middle age, and perhaps increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Method. In this work, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) based classification method to help classify diabetes by distinguishing the brains with abnormal functions from the normal ones on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). The proposed classification model is based on the Inception-v4-Residual convolutional neural network architecture. In our workflow, the original rs-fMRI data are first mapped to generate amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) images and then fed into the CNN model to get the classification result to indicate the potential existence of DM. Result. We validate our method on a realistic clinical rs-fMRI dataset, and the achieved average accuracy is 89.95% in fivefold cross-validation.

The present research aimed to explore the alterations of the WM microstructure and its impact on amnestic mild cognitive (aMCI) and AD patients. Mechanical learning methods were used to explore the validity of WM microstructure lesions on the classification in AD spectrum disease. Methods: Neuropsychological data and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images were collected from 28 AD subjects, 31 aMCI subjects, and 27 normal controls (NC). Tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) were used to extract diffusion parameters in WM tracts. We performed ANOVA analysis to compare diffusion parameters and clinical features among the three groups. Partial correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between diffusion metrics and cognitive functions controlling for age, gender, and years of education. Additionally, we performed the support vector machine (SVM) classification to determine the discriminative ability of DTI metrics in the differentiation of aMCI and AD patients from controls. Results: As compared to controls or aMCI patients, AD patients displayed widespread WM lesions, including in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and superior longitudinal fasciculus. Significant correlations between fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusion (RD) of the long longitudinal tract and memory deficits were found in aMCI and AD groups, respectively. Furthermore, through SVM classification, we found DTI indicators generated by FA and MD parameters can effectively distinguish AD patients from the control group with accuracy rates of up to 89 and 85%, respectively. Conclusion: The WM microstructure is extensively disrupted in AD patients, and the WM integrity of the long longitudinal tract is closely related to memory, which would hold potential value for monitoring the progression of AD.

We tested the hypothesis that neuroinflammation and tau protein aggregation colocalize macroscopically, and correlate with clinical severity. Methods Nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND) for each ligand was quantified in 83 regions of interest (ROIs). The [C-11]PK11195 and [F-18]AV-1451 BP(ND)values were correlated across all regions. The spatial distributions of [C-11]PK11195 and [F-18]AV-1451 binding were determined by principal component analyses (PCAs), and the loading of each spatial component compared against the patients' clinical severity (using the PSP rating scale). Results Regional [C-11]PK11195 and [F-18]AV-1451 binding were positively correlated (R = 0.577,p< 0.0001). The PCA identified 4 components for each ligand, reflecting the relative expression of tau pathology or neuroinflammation in distinct groups of brain regions. Positive associations between [C-11]PK11195 and [F-18]AV-1451 components' loadings were found in both subcortical (R = 0.769,p< 0.0001) and cortical regions (R = 0.836,p< 0.0001). There were positive correlations between clinical severity and both subcortical tau pathology (R = 0.667,p= 0.003) and neuroinflammation (R = 0.788,p< 0.001). Interpretation We show that tau pathology and neuroinflammation colocalize in PSP, and that individual differences in subcortical tau pathology and neuroinflammation are linked to clinical severity. Although longitudinal studies are needed to determine causal associations between these molecular pathologies, we suggest that the combination of tau- and immune-oriented strategies may be useful for effective disease-modifying treatments in PSP.

We examined in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology in adults with DS, and determined their cross-sectional relationship with age, beta-amyloid pathology, and mild cognitive impairment or clinical AD diagnostic status. Methods Participants from the Biomarkers of Alzheimer's Disease in Down Syndrome study (n = 138, 50 +/- 7 years, 39% women) with MRI data and a subset (n = 90) with amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) were included. We derived MRI-based biomarkers of cerebrovascular pathology, including white matter hyperintensities (WMH), infarcts, cerebral microbleeds, and enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), as well as PET-based biomarkers of amyloid burden. Participants were characterized as cognitively stable (CS), mild cognitive impairment-DS (MCI-DS), possible AD dementia, or definite AD dementia based on in-depth assessments of cognition, function, and health status. Results There were detectable WMH, enlarged PVS, infarcts, and microbleeds as early as the 5th decade of life. There was a monotonic increase in WMH volume, enlarged PVS, and presence of infarcts across diagnostic groups (CS < MCI-DS < possible AD dementia < definite AD dementia). Higher amyloid burden was associated with a higher likelihood of an infarct. Interpretation The findings highlight the prevalence of cerebrovascular disease in adults with DS and add to a growing body of evidence that implicates cerebrovascular disease as a core feature of AD and not simply a comorbidity.

This paper reviews the applications of deep learning methods for neuroimaging-based brain disorder analysis. We first provide a comprehensive overview of deep learning techniques and popular network architectures by introducing various types of deep neural networks and recent developments. We then review deep learning methods for computer-aided analysis of four typical brain disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Autism spectrum disorder, and Schizophrenia, where the first two diseases are neurodegenerative disorders and the last two are neurodevelopmental and psychiatric disorders, respectively.

In this work we propose a fast and accurate deep learning based neuroimaging pipeline for the automated processing of structural human brain MRI scans, replicating FreeSurfer's anatomical segmentation including surface reconstruction and cortical parcellation. To this end, we introduce an advanced deep learning architecture capable of whole-brain segmentation into 95 classes. The network architecture incorporates local and global competition via competitive dense blocks and competitive skip pathways, as well as multi-slice information aggregation that specifically tailor network performance towards accurate segmentation of both cortical and subcortical structures. Further, we perform fast cortical surface reconstruction and thickness analysis by introducing a spectral spherical embedding and by directly mapping the cortical labels from the image to the surface. This approach provides a full FreeSurfer alternative for volumetric analysis (in under 1 min) and surface-based thickness analysis (within only around 1 h runtime). For sustainability of this approach we perform extensive validation: we assert high segmentation accuracy on several unseen datasets, measure generalizability and demonstrate increased test-retest reliability, and high sensitivity to group differences in dementia.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;OCT 1;2020;219;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.117012;J

As a fast and easy-to-use visual interpretation support system, we analyze whether the deep learning-based end-to-end estimation of amyloid burden improves inter-reader agreement as well as the confidence of the visual reading. Methods A total of 121 clinical routines [F-18]Florbetaben PET images were collected for the randomized blind-reader study. The amyloid PET images were visually interpreted by three experts independently blind to other information. The readers qualitatively interpreted images without quantification at the first reading session. After more than 2-week interval, the readers additionally interpreted images with the quantification results provided by the deep learning system. The qualitative assessment was based on a 3-point BAPL score (1: no amyloid load, 2: minor amyloid load, and 3: significant amyloid load). The confidence score for each session was evaluated by a 3-point score (0: ambiguous, 1: probably, and 2: definite to decide). Results Inter-reader agreements for the visual reading based on a 3-point scale (BAPL score) calculated by Fleiss kappa coefficients were 0.46 and 0.76 for the visual reading without and with the deep learning system, respectively. For the two reading sessions, the confidence score of visual reading was improved at the visual reading session with the output (1.27 +/- 0.078 for visual reading-only session vs. 1.66 +/- 0.63 for a visual reading session with the deep learning system).

Methods Using a single molecule array technology, ultrasensitive immunoassays for serum concentrations of t-tau, Nf-L, and GFAP were measured in a population sample of 1,327 participants (60% African Americans and women) who had a clinical evaluation for AD, had completed in-home cognitive assessments, and had undergone 1.5T structural magnetic resonance imaging. Results Higher concentrations of serum biomarkers were associated with the development of clinical AD; especially, the time-specific associations were notable: t-tau 8 to 16 years, and Nf-L and GFAP 4 to 8 years prior to clinical AD. Serum biomarkers were associated with faster cognitive decline over 16 years; baseline t-tau > 0.40pg/ml had 30% faster decline, Nf-L > 25.5pg/ml had 110% faster decline, and GFAP > 232pg/ml had 130% faster decline compared to those in the lowest quartile. Participants with baseline GFAP > 232pg/ml showed 160% faster decline in hippocampal volume compared to those with values < 160pg/ml. Additionally, higher baseline t-tau was associated with faster increase in 3rd ventricular volume, and baseline Nf-L and GFAP were associated with faster decline in cortical thickness. Interpretation Serum t-tau, Nf-L, and GFAP predict the development of sporadic AD and cognitive decline, and changes in structural brain characteristics, suggesting their usefulness not only as screening and predictive biomarkers, but also in capturing the pathogenesis of Alzheimer dementia.

Neuroimaging techniques predominantly provide insight into anatomic structure changes associated with AD. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied towards creating and evaluating models capable of differentiating between cognitively unimpaired, patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and AD dementia. Several published approaches apply information fusion techniques, providing ways of combining several input sources in the medical domain, which contributes to knowledge of broader and enriched quality. The aim of this paper is to fuse sociodemographic data such as age, marital status, education and gender, and genetic data (presence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE)-epsilon 4 allele) with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. This enables enriched multi-modal features, that adequately represent the MRI scan visually and is adopted for creating and modeling classification systems capable of detecting amnestic MCI (aMCI). To fully utilize the potential of deep convolutional neural networks, two extra color layers denoting contrast intensified and blurred image adaptations are virtually augmented to each MRI scan, completing the Red-Green-Blue (RGB) color channels. Deep convolutional activation features (DeCAF) are extracted from the average pooling layer of the deep learning system Inception_v3. These features from the fused MRI scans are used as visual representation for the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) classification model. The proposed approach is evaluated on a sub-study containing 120 participants (aMCI = 61 and cognitively unimpaired = 59) of the Heinz Nixdorf Recall (HNR) Study with a baseline model accuracy of 76%. Further evaluation was conducted on the ADNI Phase 1 dataset with 624 participants (aMCI = 397 and cognitively unimpaired = 227) with a baseline model accuracy of 66.27%. Experimental results show that the proposed approach achieves 90% accuracy and 0.90F(1)-Score at classification of aMCI vs. cognitively unimpaired participants on the HNR Study dataset, and 77% accuracy and 0.83F(1)-Score on the ADNI dataset.;1932-6203;;;SEP 25;2020;15;10.1371/journal.pone.0236868;J

It requires experience of neuropsychologists and has sensibilities of 80% when separating between Healthy and MCI. The aim of this work is to evaluate the performance of a method for classification among the three groups using a database of 17 Healthy, 9 MCI and 15 AD. The method uses wavelet decomposition of the EEG signal (Haar mother wavelet and 5 decomposition levels) to calculate the wavelet entropy and theta and beta relative power of the EEG signal. These features are used as inputs to a three-way classifier consisting in a support vector machine with polynomial kernel and a two-layer neural network. The last implements a vote procedure. Wavelet entropy was evaluated together with the sample entropy and approximated entropy to choose the one that best detected changes in the complexity of the EEG signal. The results show that it is possible to automatically classify a subject of a particular group with an overall accuracy of 92.6%, close to the best result found in the literature that is 97.9%.

Nevertheless, Rician noise is inevitably injected during the image acquisition process, which leads to poor observation and interferes with the treatment. Owing to the complexity of Rician noise, using the elimination method of Gaussian to remove it does not perform well. Therefore, the feature fusion and attention network (FFA-DMRI) is proposed to separate noise from observed MRI. Inspired by the attention-guided CNN network (ADNet) and Convolutional block attention module (CBAM), a spatial attention mechanism has been specially designed to obtain the area of interest in MRI. Furthermore, the feature fusion block concatenates local with global information, which makes full use of the multilevel structure and boosts the expressive ability of network. The comprehensive experiments on Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative dataset (ADNI) have demonstrated high effectiveness of FFA-DMRI with maintaining the crucial brain details.

Presently, 46.8 million people affected with dementia worldwide, and it may increase to 130 million by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cost of care for AD patients in 2015 was 818 billion US dollars and is expected to increase intensely due to the increasing number of patients due to the aging society. It isn't easy to cure AD, but early detection is crucial.

Flortaucipir standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated in a temporal meta region of interest (meta-ROI), entorhinal cortex and cortical/subcortical regions selected to match the tau lesion analysis. Global PiB SUVR was calculated. Autoradiography was performed in 1 PSP patient, with digital pathology used to quantify tau burden. Results Nine cases (37.5%) had A beta plaques. Global PiB SUVR correlated with A beta plaque count, with 100% specificity and 50% sensitivity for diffuse plaques. Twenty-one (87.5%) had Braak stages I to IV. Flortaucipir correlated with neurofibrillary tangle counts in entorhinal cortex, but entorhinal and meta-ROI SUVRs were not elevated in Braak IV or primary age-related tauopathy. Flortaucipir uptake patterns differed across FTLD pathologies and could separate PSP and CBD. Flortaucipir correlated with tau lesion score in red nucleus and midbrain tegmentum across patients, but not in cortical or basal ganglia regions. Autoradiography demonstrated minimal uptake of flortaucipir, although flortaucipir correlated with quantitative tau burden across regions. Interpretation Molecular PET shows expected correlations with Alzheimer-related pathology but lacks sensitivity to detect mild Alzheimer pathology in FTLD.

As advanced AD is difficult to manage, accurate diagnosis of the disorder is critical. Previous studies have revealed effective deep learning methods of classification. However, deep learning methods require a large number of image datasets. Moreover, medical images are affected by various environmental factors. In the current study, we propose a deep learning-based method for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is less sensitive to different datasets for external validation, based upon F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography/computed tomography (FDG-PET/CT). Results The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of our proposed network were 86.09%, 80.00%, and 92.96% (respectively) using our dataset, and 91.02%, 87.93%, and 93.57% (respectively) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We observed that our model classified AD and normal cognitive (NC) cases based on the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), where pathological changes occur in AD. The performance of the GAP layer was considered statistically significant compared to the fully connected layer in both datasets for accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p < 0.01). In addition, performance comparison between the ADNI dataset and our dataset showed no statistically significant differences in accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity (p > 0.05).

Since there is no effective treatment for AD, it is extremely important to diagnose MCI as early as possible, as this makes it possible to delay its progression toward AD. However, it's challenging to identify early MCI (EMCI) because there are only mild changes in the brain structures of patients compared with a normal control (NC). To extract remarkable features for these mild changes, in this paper, a multi-modality diagnosis approach based on deep learning is presented. Firstly, we propose to use structure MRI and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) images as the multi-modality data to identify EMCI. Then, a convolutional neural network based on transfer learning technique is developed to extract features of the multi-modality data, where an L1-norm is introduced to reduce the feature dimensionality and retrieve essential features for the identification. At last, the classifier produces 94.2% accuracy for EMCI vs. NC on an ADNI dataset. Experimental results show that multi-modality data can provide more useful information to distinguish EMCI from NC compared with single modality data, and the proposed method can improve classification performance, which is beneficial to early intervention of AD. In addition, it is found that DTI image can act as an important biomarker for EMCI from the point of view of a clinical diagnosis.;1663-4365;;;SEP 4;2020;12;10.3389/fnagi.2020.00206;J

Despite providing such rich functional information, fMRI is still not a commonly used clinical technique due to inaccuracy involved in analysis of extremely noisy data. However, ongoing developments in deep learning techniques suggest potential improvements and better performance in many different domains. Our main purpose is to utilize the potentials of deep learning techniques for fMRI data for clinical use. Approach: We present one such synergy of fMRI and deep learning, where we apply a simplified yet accurate method using a modified 3D convolutional neural networks (CNN) to resting-state fMRI data for feature extraction and classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The CNN is designed in such a way that it uses the fMRI data with much less preprocessing, preserving both spatial and temporal information. Results: Once trained, the network is successfully able to classify between fMRI data from healthy controls and AD subjects, including subjects in the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. We have also extracted spatiotemporal features useful for classification. Conclusion: This CNN can detect and differentiate between the earlier and later stages of MCI and AD and hence, it may have potential clinical applications in both early detection and better diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.

Hence,non-pharmacologicalcognitive intervention for patients at early stages of AD has received a lot of attention due to its non-invasive manner, safety, and scalability. Multi-domain interventions targeting memory and non-memory domains simultaneously are urgently needed for an optimal intervention effect on amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. However, most of the previous multi-domain cognitive intervention studies evaluated the intervention outcomes based solely on neuropsychological assessment or simple characterization of brain anatomical structural changes. This work is the first of its kind to develop a patient-specificquantitative analysisfor the underlyingfunctionalbrain regional activity changes during the multi-domain cognitive intervention process. Specifically, we used fMRI data from 12 patients, who were trained for three months, and we developed the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G) to analyze these data. We obtained probabilistic changes across all the brain regions, and we found that brain regions in the default mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal attention systems had relatively large variations during the non-pharmacological training. These fundamental insights could provide effective new biomarkers for monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration. Identifying heterogeneous cognitive impairment markers at an early stage is vital for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. However, due to complex and uncertain brain connectivity features in the cognitive domains, it remains challenging to quantify functional brain connectomic changes during non-pharmacological interventions for amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) patients. We present aquantitativemethod for functional brain network analysis of fMRI data based on the multi-graph unsupervised Gaussian embedding method (MG2G). This neural network-based model can effectively learn low-dimensional Gaussian distributions from the original high-dimensional sparse functional brain networks, quantify uncertainties in link prediction, and discover theintrinsicdimensionality of brain networks. Using the Wasserstein distance to measure probabilistic changes, we discovered that brain regions in the default mode network and somatosensory/somatomotor hand, fronto-parietal task control, memory retrieval, and visual and dorsal attention systems had relatively large variations during non-pharmacological training, which might provide distinct biomarkers for fine-grained monitoring of aMCI cognitive alteration. An important finding of our study is the ability of the new method to capture subtle changes for individual patients before and after short-term intervention. More broadly, the MG2G method can be used in studying multiple brain disorders and injuries, e.g., in Parkinson's disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI), and hence it will be useful to the wider neuroscience community.;1553-734X;1553-7358;;SEP;2020;16;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008186;J

Recently, researchers have developed a new method for the instinctive analysis of AD based on machine learning and its subfield, deep learning. Recent state-of-the-art techniques consider multimodal diagnosis, which has been shown to achieve high accuracy compared to a unimodal prognosis. Furthermore, many studies have used structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to measure brain volumes and the volume of subregions, as well as to search for diffuse changes in white/gray matter in the brain. In this study, T1-weighted structural MRI was used for the early classification of AD. MRI results in high-intensity visible features, making preprocessing and segmentation easy. To use this image modality, we acquired four types of datasets from each dataset's server. In this work, we downloaded 326 subjects from the National Research Center for Dementia homepage, 123 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) homepage, 121 subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Repository Without Borders homepage, and 131 subjects from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center homepage. In our experiment, we used the multiatlas label propagation with expectation-maximization-based refinement segmentation method. We segmented the images into 138 anatomical morphometry images (in which 40 features belonged to subcortical volumes and the remaining 98 features belonged to cortical thickness). The entire dataset was split into a 70 : 30 (training and testing) ratio before classifying the data. A principal component analysis was used for dimensionality reduction. Then, the support vector machine radial basis function classifier was used for classification between two groups-AD versus health control (HC) and early mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (EMCI) versus late MCI (LMCI). The proposed method performed very well for all four types of dataset. For instance, for the AD versus HC group, the classifier achieved an area under curve (AUC) of more than 89% for each dataset. For the EMCI versus LMCI group, the classifier achieved an AUC of more than 80% for every dataset. Moreover, we also calculated Cohen kappa and Jaccard index statistical values for all datasets to evaluate the classification reliability. Finally, we compared our results with those of recently published state-of-the-art methods.;2040-2295;2040-2309;;SEP 1;2020;2020;10.1155/2020/3743171;J

Incomplete data problem is unavoidable in multi-modal neuroimage studies due to patient dropouts and/or poor data quality. Conventional methods usually discard data-missing subjects, thus significantly reducing the number of training samples. Even though several deep learning methods have been proposed, they usually rely on pre-defined regions-of-interest in neuroimages, requiring disease-specific expert knowledge. To this end, we propose a spatially-constrained Fisher representation framework for brain disease diagnosis with incomplete multi-modal neuroimages. We first impute missing PET images based on their corresponding MRI scans using a hybrid generative adversarial network. With the complete (after imputation) MRI and PET data, we then develop a spatially-constrained Fisher representation network to extract statistical descriptors of neuroimages for disease diagnosis, assuming that these descriptors follow a Gaussian mixture model with a strong spatial constraint (i.e., images from different subjects have similar anatomical structures). Experimental results on three databases suggest that our method can synthesize reasonable neuroimages and achieve promising results in brain disease identification, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.;0278-0062;1558-254X;;SEPT;2020;39;10.1109/TMI.2020.2983085;J

To study these associations in more detail, it is highly important that the WM tracts can be accurately and reproducibly characterized from brain diffusion MRI. In addition, to enable analysis of WM tracts in large datasets and in clinical practice it is essential to have methodology that is fast and easy to apply. This work therefore presents a new approach for WM tract segmentation: Neuro4Neuro, that is capable of direct extraction of WM tracts from diffusion tensor images using convolutional neural network (CNN). This 3D end-to-end method is trained to segment 25 WM tracts in aging individuals from a large population-based study (N = 9752, 1.5T MRI). The proposed method showed good segmentation performance and high reproducibility, i.e., a high spatial agreement (Cohen's kappa, kappa = 0.72-0.83) and a low scan-rescan error in tract-specific diffusion measures (e.g., fractional anisotropy: epsilon = 1%-5%). The reproducibility of the proposed method was higher than that of a tractography-based segmentation algorithm, while being orders of magnitude faster (0.5s to segment one tract). In addition, we showed that the method successfully generalizes to diffusion scans from an external dementia dataset (N = 58, 3T MRI). In two proof-of-principle experiments, we associated WM microstructure ob-tained using the proposed method with age in a normal elderly population, and with disease subtypes in a dementia cohort. In concordance with the literature, results showed a widespread reduction of microstructural organization with aging and substantial group-wise microstructure differences between dementia subtypes. In conclusion, we presented a highly reproducible and fast method for WM tract segmentation that has the potential of being used in large-scale studies and clinical practice.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;SEP;2020;218;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2020.116993;J

Methods Participants were 343 clinically normal individuals (women, 58%; 73.8 [8.5] years) and 55 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI; women, 38%; 76.9 [7.3] years) from the Harvard Aging Brain Study and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We examined(18)F-Flortaucipir (FTP)-positron emission tomography (PET) signal across 41 cortical and subcortical regions of interest (ROIs). Linear regression models estimated the effect of sex on FTP-signal for each ROI after adjusting for age and cohort. We also examined interactions between sex*A beta-PET positive / negative (+ / -) and sex*apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE epsilon 4) status. Linear mixed models estimated the moderating effect of sex on the relationship between a composite of sex-differentiated tau ROIs and cognitive decline. Results Women showed significantly higher FTP-signals than men across multiple regions of the cortical mantle (p< 0.007). beta-amyloid (A beta)-moderated sex differences in tau signal were localized to medial and inferio-lateral temporal regions (p< 0.007); A beta + women exhibited greater FTP-signal than other groups. APOE epsilon 4-moderated sex differences in FTP-signal were only found in the lateral occipital lobe. Women with higher FTP-signals in composite ROI exhibited faster cognitive decline than men (p= 0.04). Interpretation Tau vulnerability in women is not just limited to the medial temporal lobe and significantly contributed to greater risk of faster cognitive decline. Interactive effects of sex and A beta were predominantly localized in the temporal lobe, however, sex differences in extra-temporal tau highlights the possibility of accelerated tau proliferation in women with the onset of clinical symptomatology.

Methods Data from 62 consecutive patients who presented with magnetic resonance imaging changes indicative of NPH were studied with regard to cognitive and gait functions before and after drainage of 40-50ml of CSF. Additionally, S100 protein, neuron-specific enolase, beta-amyloid protein, tau protein and phospho-tau were determined in CSF. Statistical analyses were carried out with ANOVA and multiple linear regression. Results Patients with CSF constellations typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 28) improved significantly in cognitive and gait-related functions after CSF drainage. In contrast, those patients without a CSF constellation typical for Alzheimer's disease (n = 34) did not improve in cognitive and gait-related functions after CSF drainage. In addition, positive CSF biomarkers for Alzheimer's disease predicted these improvements.

Based on the fact that healthy and unhealthy brain regions and functions differ slightly, studying the complex topology of the functional and structural networks in the human brain is too complicated considering the growth of evaluation measures. One of the applications of irregular graph deep learning is to analyze the human cognitive functions related to the gene expression and related distributed spatial patterns. Since a variety of brain solutions can be dynamically held in the neuronal networks of the brain with different activity patterns and functional connectivity, both node-centric and graph-centric tasks are involved in this application. In this study, we used an individual generative model and high order graph analysis for the region of interest recognition areas of the brain with abnormal connection during performing certain tasks and resting-state or decompose irregular observations. Accordingly, a high order framework of Variational Graph Autoencoder with a Gaussian distributer was proposed in the paper to analyze the functional data in brain imaging studies in which Generative Adversarial Network is employed for optimizing the latent space in the process of learning strong non-rigid graphs among large scale data. Furthermore, the possible modes of correlations were distinguished in abnormal brain connections. Our goal was to find the degree of correlation between the affected regions and their simultaneous occurrence over time. We can take advantage of this to diagnose brain diseases or show the ability of the nervous system to modify brain topology at all angles and brain plasticity according to input stimuli.

However, the classification effect of CNN on EEG signals of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is not ideal. Even if EEG signals are transformed into multispectral images that are more closely matched with the model, the best classification performance can not be achieved. Therefore, to improve the performance of CNN toward EEG multispectral image classification, a multi-view convolutional neural network (MVCNN) classification model based on inceptionV1 is designed in this study. This model mainly improves and optimizes the convolutional layers and stochastic gradient descent (SGD) in the convolutional architecture model. Firstly, based on the discreteness of EEG multispectral image features, the multi-view convolutional layer structure was proposed. Then the learning rate change function of the SGD was optimized to increase the classification performance. The multi-view convolutional nerve was used in an EEG multispectral classification task involving 19 aMCI with T2DM and 20 normal controls.

In particular, the method is based on ensembling different brain structural perspectives with artificial neural networks. On one hand, these perspectives are obtained with complex network measures tailored to describe the altered brain connectivity. In turn, the brain reconstruction is obtained by combining diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data to tractography algorithms. On the other hand, artificial neural networks provide a means to learn a mapping from topological properties of the brain to the presence or absence of cognitive decline. The effectiveness of the method is studied on a well-known benchmark data set in order to evaluate if it can provide an automatic tool to support the early disease diagnosis. Also, the effects of balancing issues are investigated to further assess the reliability of the complex network approach to DWI data. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Although several pioneering studies have been devoted to automated AD diagnosis based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), their performance is somewhat limited due to non-effective mining of spatial-temporal dependency. Besides, few of these existing approaches consider the explicit detection and modeling of discriminative brain regions (i.e., network hubs) that are sensitive to AD progression. In this paper, we propose a unique Spatial-Temporal convolutional-recurrent neural Network (STNet) for automated prediction of AD progression and network hub detection from rs-fMRI time series. Our STNet incorporates the spatial-temporal information mining and AD-related hub detection into an end-to-end deep learning model. Specifically, we first partition rs-fMRI time series into a sequence of overlapping sliding windows. A sequence of convolutional components are then designed to capture the local-to-global spatially-dependent patterns within each sliding window, based on which we are able to identify discriminative hubs and characterize their unique contributions to disease diagnosis. A recurrent component with long short-term memory (LSTM) units is further employed to model the whole-brain temporal dependency from the spatially-dependent pattern sequences, thus capturing the temporal dynamics along time. We evaluate the proposed method on 174 subjects with 563 rs-fMRI scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, with results suggesting the effectiveness of our method in both tasks of disease progression prediction and AD-related hub detection.;0018-9294;1558-2531;;AUG.;2020;67;10.1109/TBME.2019.2957921;J

"Zhang, T; Shi, MY";"Zhang, Tao; Shi, Mingyang";Multi-modal neuroimaging feature fusion for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease;JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS;Background: Compared with single-modal neuroimages classification of AD, multi-modal classification can achieve better performance by fusing different information. Exploring synergy among various multi-modal neuroimages is contributed to identifying the pathological process of neurological disorders. However, it is still problematic to effectively exploit multi-modal information since the lack of an effective fusion method. New method: In this paper, we propose a deep multi-modal fusion network based on the attention mechanism, which can selectively extract features from MRI and PET branches and suppress irrelevant information. In the attention model, the fusion ratio of each modality is assigned automatically according to the importance of the data. A hierarchical fusion method is adopted to ensure the effectiveness of Multi-modal Fusion. Results: Evaluating the model on the ADNI dataset, the experimental results show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art methods. In particular, the final classification results of the NC/AD, SMCI/PMCI and Four-Class are 95.21 %, 89.79 %, and 86.15 %, respectively. Comparison with existing methods: Different from the early fusion and the late fusion, the hierarchical fusion method contributes to learning the synergy between the multi-modal data. Compared with some other prominent algorithms, the attention model enables our network to focus on the regions of interest and effectively fuse the multi-modal data. Conclusion: Benefit from the hierarchical structure with attention model, the proposed network is capable of exploiting low-level and high-level features extracted from the multi-modal data and improving the accuracy of AD diagnosis.

In the case of schizophrenia and other primary delusional disorders, their appearance is often how the disorder is first detected and can be sufficient for diagnosis. At this time, not much is known about the brain dysfunctions leading to delusions, and hindering our understanding is that the complexity of the nature of delusions, and their very unique relevance to the human experience has hampered elucidation of their underlying neurobiology using either patients or animal models. Advances in neuroimaging along with improved psychiatric and cognitive modeling offers us a new opportunity to look with more investigative power into the deluded brain. In this article, based on data obtained from neuroimaging studies, we have attempted to draw a picture of the neural networks involved when delusion is present and evaluate whether different manifestations of delusions engage different regions of the brain.;1073-8584;1089-4098;;FEB;2021;27;10.1177/1073858420936172;J

One important data curation task is the structured organization of a dataset for preserving integrity and ensuring reusability. Therefore, we investigated whether this data organization step can be automated. To this end, we designed a convolutional neural network (CNN) that automatically recognizes eight different brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan types based on visual appearance. Thus, our method is unaffected by inconsistent or missing scan metadata. It can recognize pre-contrast T1-weighted (T1w),post-contrast T1-weighted (T1wC), T2-weighted (T2w), proton density-weighted (PDw) and derived maps (e.g. apparent diffusion coefficient and cerebral blood flow). In a first experiment,we used scans of subjects with brain tumors: 11065 scans of 719 subjects for training, and 2369 scans of 192 subjects for testing. The CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 98.7%. In a second experiment, we trained the CNN on all 13434 scans from the first experiment and tested it on 7227 scans of 1318 Alzheimer's subjects. Here, the CNN achieved an overall accuracy of 98.5%. In conclusion, our method can accurately predict scan type, and can quickly and automatically sort a brain MRI dataset virtually without the need for manual verification. In this way, our method can assist with properly organizing a dataset, which maximizes the shareability and integrity of the data.;1539-2791;1559-0089;;JAN;2021;19;10.1007/s12021-020-09475-7;J

Currently, non-invasive brain stimulation techniques, such as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), are proposed as tools able to modulate cognitive functions in brain aging, acting on networks properties and connectivity. Segregation and integration measures are used and evaluated by means of local clustering (segregation) and path length (integration). Moreover, to assess the balancing between them, the Small World (SW) parameter is employed, evaluating functional coupling in normal brain aging and in pathological conditions including neurodegeneration. The aim of this study was to systematically investigate the tDCS-induced effects on brain network proprieties in physiological aging. In order to reach this aim, cortical activity was acquired from healthy young and elderly subjects by means of EEG recorded before, during, and after anodal, cathodal, and sham tDCS sessions. Specifically, the aim to exploring tDCS polarity-dependent changes in the age-dependent network dynamics was based on a network graph theory application on two groups divided in young and elderly subjects. Eighteen healthy young (9 females; mean age = 24.7, SD = 3.2) and fifteen elderly subjects (9 females; mean = 70.1, SD = 5.1) were enrolled. Each participant received anodal, cathodal, or sham tDCS over the left prefrontal cortex (PFC) in three separate experimental sessions performed 1 week apart.

Approach: We built a predictive model based on a supervised hybrid neural network utilizing a three-dimensional convolutional neural network to perform volume analysis of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and integration of nonimaging clinical data at the fully connected layer of the architecture.

In particular, MRI-derived brain age has been used as a comprehensive biomarker of brain health that can identify both advanced and resilient ageing individuals via deviations from typical brain ageing. Imaging signatures of various brain diseases, including schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, have also been identified using machine learning. Prior efforts to derive these indices have been hampered by the need for sophisticated and not easily reproducible processing steps, by insufficiently powered or diversified samples from which typical brain ageing trajectories were derived, and by limited reproducibility across populations and MRI scanners. Herein, we develop and test a sophisticated deep brain network (DeepBrainNet) using a large (n = 11 729) set of MRI scans from a highly diversified cohort spanning different studies, scanners, ages and geographic locations around the world. Tests using both cross-validation and a separate replication cohort of 2739 individuals indicate that DeepBrainNet obtains robust brain-age estimates from these diverse datasets without the need for specialized image data preparation and processing. Furthermore, we show evidence that moderately fit brain ageing models may provide brain age estimates that are most discriminant of individuals with pathologies. This is not unexpected as tightly-fitting brain age models naturally produce brain-age estimates that offer little information beyond age, and loosely fitting models may contain a lot of noise. Our results offer some experimental evidence against commonly pursued tightly-fitting models. We show that the moderately fitting brain age models obtain significantly higher differentiation compared to tightly-fitting models in two of the four disease groups tested. Critically, we demonstrate that leveraging DeepBrainNet, along with transfer learning, allows us to construct more accurate classifiers of several brain diseases, compared to directly training classifiers on patient versus healthy control datasets or using common imaging databases such as ImageNet. We, therefore, derive a domain-specific deep network likely to reduce the need for application-specific adaptation and tuning of generic deep learning networks. We made the DeepBrainNet model freely available to the community for MRI-based evaluation of brain health in the general population and over the lifespan.;0006-8950;1460-2156;;JUL;2020;143;10.1093/brain/awaa160;J

In this study, we present a sophisticated machine learning (ML) model of great accuracy to diagnose the early stages of AD. A total of 373 MRI tests belonging to 150 subjects (age >= 60) were examined and analyzed in parallel with fourteen distinct features related to standard AD diagnosis. Four ML models, such as naive Bayes (NB), artificial neural networks (ANN), K-nearest neighbor (KNN), and support-vector machines (SVM), and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve metric were used to validate the model performance. Each model evaluation was done in three independent experiments. In the first experiment, a manual feature selection was used for model training, and ANN generated the highest accuracy in terms of ROC (0.812). In the second experiment, automatic feature selection was conducted by wrapping methods, and the NB achieved the highest ROC of 0.942. The last experiment consisted of an ensemble or hybrid modeling developed to combine the four models. This approach resulted in an improved accuracy ROC of 0.991. We conclude that the involvement of ensemble modeling, coupled with selective features, can predict with better accuracy the development of AD at an early stage.;;2077-0383;;JUL;2020;9;10.3390/jcm9072146;J
"Liu, YQ; Yan, ZZ";"Liu, Yingqian; Yan, Zhuangzhi";A Combined Deep-Learning and Lattice Boltzmann Model for Segmentation of the Hippocampus in MRI;SENSORS;Segmentation of the hippocampus (HC) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an essential step for diagnosis and monitoring of several clinical situations such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), schizophrenia and epilepsy. Automatic segmentation of HC structures is challenging due to their small volume, complex shape, low contrast and discontinuous boundaries. The active contour model (ACM) with a statistical shape prior is robust. However, it is difficult to build a shape prior that is general enough to cover all possible shapes of the HC and that suffers the problems of complicated registration of the shape prior and the target object and of low efficiency. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic model that combines a deep belief network (DBN) and the lattice Boltzmann (LB) method for the segmentation of HC. The training process of DBN consists of unsupervised bottom-up training and supervised training of a top restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM). Given an input image, the trained DBN is utilized to infer the patient-specific shape prior of the HC. The specific shape prior is not only used to determine the initial contour, but is also introduced into the LB model as part of the external force to refine the segmentation. We used a subset of OASIS-1 as the training set and the preliminary release of EADC-ADNI as the testing set. The segmentation results of our method have good correlation and consistency with the manual segmentation results.;;1424-8220;;JUL;2020;20;10.3390/s20133628;J
"Huang, JS; Zhou, LP; Wang, L; Zhang, DQ";"Huang, Jiashuang; Zhou, Luping; Wang, Lei; Zhang, Daoqiang";Attention-Diffusion-Bilinear Neural Network for Brain Network Analysis;IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MEDICAL IMAGING;Brain network provides essential insights in diagnosing many brain disorders. Integrative analysis of multiple types of connectivity, e.g, functional connectivity (FC) and structural connectivity (SC), can take advantage of their complementary information and therefore may help to identify patients. However, traditional brain network methods usually focus on either FC or SC for describing node interactions and only consider the interaction between paired network nodes. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose an Attention-Diffusion-Bilinear Neural Network (ADB-NN) framework for brain network analysis, which is trained in an end-to-end manner. The proposed network seamlessly couples FC and SC to learn wider node interactions and generates a joint representation of FC and SC for diagnosis. Specifically, a brain network (graph) is first defined, where each node corresponding to a brain region is governed by the features of brain activities (i.e., FC) extracted from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and the presence of edges is determined by neural fiber physical connections (i.e., SC) extracted from Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI). Based on this graph, we train two Attention-Diffusion-Bilinear (ADB) modules jointly. In each module, an attention model is utilized to automatically learn the strength of node interactions. This information further guides a diffusion process that generates new node representations by considering the influence from other nodes as well. After that, the second-order statistics of these node representations are extracted by bilinear pooling to form connectivity-based features for disease prediction. The two ADB modules correspond to the one-step and two-step diffusion, respectively. Experiments on a real epilepsy dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.;0278-0062;1558-254X;;JUL;2020;39;10.1109/TMI.2020.2973650;J

Due to incomplete clinical labels/scores, previous learning-based studies often simply discard subjects without ground-truth scores. This would result in limited training data for learning reliable and robust models. Also, existing methods focus only on using hand-crafted features (e.g., image intensity or tissue volume) of MRI data, and these features may not be well coordinated with prediction models. In this paper, we propose a weakly supervised densely connected neural network (wiseDNN) for brain disease prognosis using baseline MRI data and incomplete clinical scores. Specifically, we first extract multiscale image patches (located by anatomical landmarks) from MRI to capture local-to-global structural information of images, and then develop a weakly supervised densely connected network for task-oriented extraction of imaging features and joint prediction of multiple clinical measures. A weighted loss function is further employed to make full use of all available subjects (even those without ground-truth scores at certain time-points) for network training. The experimental results on 1469 subjects from both ADNI-1 and ADNI-2 datasets demonstrate that our proposed method can efficiently predict future clinical measures of subjects.;2168-2267;2168-2275;;JUL;2020;50;10.1109/TCYB.2019.2904186;J

Existing studies usually use Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) method to construct FCNs, and then extract network measures (e.g., clustering coefficients) as features to learn a diagnostic model. However, the valuable observation information in network construction (e.g., specific contributions of different time points), as well as high-level and high-order network features are neglected in these studies. In this paper, we first define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure the correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are learned in a data-driven manner to characterize the contributions of different time points, thus conveying the richer interaction information among brain regions compared with the PCC method. Furthermore, we build a wc-kernel based convolutional neural network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for learning the hierarchical (Le., from local to global and also from low-level to high-level) features for disease diagnosis, by using fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to build dynamic FCNs using our proposed wc-kernels. Then, we define another three layers to sequentially extract local (brain region specific), global (brain network specific) and temporal features from the constructed dynamic FCNs for classification.

In particular, over 30 papers have proposed to use convolutional neural networks (CNN) for AD classification from anatomical MRI. However, the classification performance is difficult to compare across studies due to variations in components such as participant selection, image preprocessing or validation procedure. Moreover, these studies are hardly reproducible because their frameworks are not publicly accessible and because implementation details are lacking. Lastly, some of these papers may report a biased performance due to inadequate or unclear validation or model selection procedures. In the present work, we aim to address these limitations through three main contributions. First, we performed a systematic literature review. We identified four main types of approaches: i) 2D slice-level, ii) 3D patch-level, iii) ROI-based and iv) 3D subject-level CNN. Moreover, we found that more than half of the surveyed papers may have suffered from data leakage and thus reported biased performance. Our second contribution is the extension of our open-source framework for classification of AD using CNN and T1-weighted MRI. The framework comprises previously developed tools to automatically convert ADNI, AIBL and OASIS data into the BIDS standard, and a modular set of image preprocessing procedures, classification architectures and evaluation procedures dedicated to deep learning. Finally, we used this framework to rigorously compare different CNN architectures. The data was split into training/validation/test sets at the very beginning and only the training/validation sets were used for model selection. To avoid any overfitting, the test sets were left untouched until the end of the peer-review process. Overall, the different 3D approaches (3D-subject, 3D-ROI, 3D-patch) achieved similar performances while that of the 2D slice approach was lower. Of note, the different CNN approaches did not perform better than a SVM with voxel-based features. The different approaches generalized well to similar populations but not to datasets with different inclusion criteria or demographical characteristics.

The spatio-temporal complexity of spontaneous activity is strongly related to perceptual, learning, and cognitive brain functions; multi-fractal analysis can be utilized to evaluate the complexity of spontaneous activity. Recent studies have shown that the deterministic dynamic behavior of spontaneous activity especially reflects the topological neural network characteristics and changes of neural network structures. However, it remains unclear whether multi-fractal analysis, recently widely utilized for neural activity, is effective for detecting the complexity of the deterministic dynamic process. To verify this point, we focused on the log-normal distribution of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) to evaluate the multi-fractality of spontaneous activity in a spiking neural network with a log-normal distribution of EPSPs. We found that the spiking activities exhibited multi-fractal characteristics. Moreover, to investigate the presence of a deterministic process in the spiking activity, we conducted a surrogate data analysis against the time-series of spiking activity. The results showed that the spontaneous spiking activity included the deterministic dynamic behavior. Overall, the combination of multi-fractal analysis and surrogate data analysis can detect deterministic complex neural activity. The multi-fractal analysis of neural activity used in this study could be widely utilized for brain modeling and evaluation methods for signals obtained by neuroimaging modalities.";1871-4080;1871-4099;;DEC;2020;14;10.1007/s11571-020-09605-6;J

M.";A Machine Learning Approach for the Differential Diagnosis of Alzheimer and Vascular Dementia Fed by MRI Selected Features;FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS;Among dementia-like diseases, Alzheimer disease (AD) and vascular dementia (VD) are two of the most frequent. AD and VD may share multiple neurological symptoms that may lead to controversial diagnoses when using conventional clinical and MRI criteria. Therefore, other approaches are needed to overcome this issue. Machine learning (ML) combined with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been shown to improve the diagnostic accuracy of several neurodegenerative diseases, including dementia. To this end, in this study, we investigated, first, whether different kinds of ML algorithms, combined with advanced MRI features, could be supportive in classifying VD from AD and, second, whether the developed approach might help in predicting the prevalent disease in subjects with an unclear profile of AD or VD. Three ML categories of algorithms were tested: artificial neural network (ANN), support vector machine (SVM), and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS). Multiple regional metrics from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of 60 subjects (33 AD, 27 VD) were used as input features to train the algorithms and find the best feature pattern to classify VD from AD. We then used the identified VD-AD discriminant feature pattern as input for the most performant ML algorithm to predict the disease prevalence in 15 dementia patients with a mixed VD-AD dementia (MXD) clinical profile using their baseline MRI data. ML predictions were compared with the diagnosis evidence from a 3-year clinical follow-up. ANFIS emerged as the most efficient algorithm in discriminating AD from VD, reaching a classification accuracy greater than 84% using a small feature pattern. Moreover, ANFIS showed improved classification accuracy when trained with a multimodal input feature data set (e.g., DTI + rs-fMRI metrics) rather than a unimodal feature data set. When applying the best discriminant pattern to the MXD group, ANFIS achieved a correct prediction rate of 77.33%. Overall, results showed that our approach has a high discriminant power to classify AD and VD profiles. Moreover, the same approach also showed potential in predicting earlier the prevalent underlying disease in dementia patients whose clinical profile is uncertain between AD and VD, therefore suggesting its usefulness in supporting physicians' diagnostic evaluations.;;1662-5196;;JUN 11;2020;14;10.3389/fninf.2020.00025;J

Also, a comprehensive evaluation of the neurobiological basis and generalizability of the end-to-end machine learning system should be given the highest priority. For this reason, a deep learning model (3D attention network, 3DAN) that can simultaneously capture candidate imaging biomarkers with an attention mechanism module and advance the diagnosis of AD based on structural magnetic resonance imaging is proposed. The generalizability and reproducibility are evaluated using cross-validation on in-house, multicenter (n = 716), and public (n = 1116) databases with an accuracy up to 92%. Significant associations between the classification output and clinical characteristics of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, a middle stage of dementia) groups provide solid neurobiological support for the 3DAN model. The effectiveness of the 3DAN model is further validated by its good performance in predicting the MCI subjects who progress to AD with an accuracy of 72%. Collectively, the findings highlight the potential for structural brain imaging to provide a generalizable, and neuroscientifically interpretable imaging biomarker that can support clinicians in the early diagnosis of AD.;;2198-3844;;JUL;2020;7;10.1002/advs.202000675;J

In this article, Daubechies discrete wavelet transform (DWT) was used, coupled with analysis of the correlations between biomedical signals that measure the electrical activity in the brain by electroencephalogram (EEG), electrical currents generated in muscles by electromyogram (EMG), and heart rate monitoring by photoplethysmography (PPG). In addition, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) for automatic detection of epileptic seizures before onset. We analyzed 30 EEG recordings 10 min before a seizure and during the seizure for 30 patients with epilepsy. In this work, we investigated the ANN dimensions of 10, 50, 100, and 150 neurons, and we found that using an ANN with 150 neurons generates an excellent performance in comparison to a 10-neuron-based ANN. However, this analyzes requests in an increased amount of time in comparison with an ANN with a lower neuron number.

A detailed analysis of the tissue structures from segmented MRI leads to a more accurate classification of specific brain disorders. Several segmentation methods to diagnose AD have been proposed with varying complexity.

Hence, deep learning methods are now preferred over state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

They trained convolutional neural networks to predict standardized uptake value ratio and classify amyloid status. The best performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before classification, 3 input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized uptake value ratio root-mean-squared error of 0.054, corresponding to 95.1% correct amyloid status prediction. The best trained network was more accurate than humans (96% versus a mean of 88%, respectively). They conclude that deep learning algorithms can estimate standardized uptake value ratio and use this to classify 18F-florbetapir PET scans and have promise to automate this laborious calculation. BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cortical amyloid quantification on PET by using the standardized uptake value ratio is valuable for research studies and clinical trials in Alzheimer disease. However, it is resource intensive, requiring co-registered MR imaging data and specialized segmentation software. We investigated the use of deep learning to automatically quantify standardized uptake value ratio and used this for classification. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using the Alzheimer?s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative dataset, we identified 2582 F-18-florbetapir PET scans, which were separated into positive and negative cases by using a standardized uptake value ratio threshold of 1.1. We trained convolutional neural networks (ResNet-50 and ResNet-152) to predict standardized uptake value ratio and classify amyloid status. We assessed performance based on network depth, number of PET input slices, and use of ImageNet pretraining. We also assessed human performance with 3 readers in a subset of 100 randomly selected cases. RESULTS: We have found that 48% of cases were amyloid positive. The best performance was seen for ResNet-50 by using regression before classification, 3 input PET slices, and pretraining, with a standardized uptake value ratio root-mean-square error of 0.054, corresponding to 95.1% correct amyloid status prediction. Using more than 3 slices did not improve performance, but ImageNet initialization did. The best trained network was more accurate than humans (96% versus a mean of 88%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Deep learning algorithms can estimate standardized uptake value ratio and use this to classify F-18-florbetapir PET scans. Such methods have promise to automate this laborious calculation, enabling quantitative measurements rapidly and in settings without extensive image processing manpower and expertise.;0195-6108;1936-959X;;JUN 1;2020;41;10.3174/ajnr.A6573;J

Accurate assessment of pathology-driven anatomical remodeling is a crucial step for the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions. Deep learning approaches have recently achieved wide success in the analysis of medical images, but they lack interpretability in the feature extraction and decision processes. In this work, we propose a new interpretable deep learning model for shape analysis. In particular, we exploit deep generative networks to model a population of anatomical segmentations through a hierarchy of conditional latent variables. At the highest level of this hierarchy, a two-dimensional latent space is simultaneously optimised to discriminate distinct clinical conditions, enabling the direct visualisation of the classification space. Moreover, the anatomical variability encoded by this discriminative latent space can be visualised in the segmentation space thanks to the generative properties of the model, making the classification task transparent. This approach yielded high accuracy in the categorisation of healthy and remodelled left ventricles when tested on unseen segmentations from our own multi-centre dataset as well as in an external validation set, and on hippocampi from healthy controls and patients with Alzheimer's disease when tested on ADNI data. More importantly, it enabled the visualisation in three-dimensions of both global and regional anatomical features which better discriminate between the conditions under exam. The proposed approach scales effectively to large populations, facilitating high-throughput analysis of normal anatomy and pathology in large-scale studies of volumetric imaging.;0278-0062;1558-254X;;JUN;2020;39;10.1109/TMI.2020.2964499;J

In this study we propose two classification algorithms for discriminating ADHD children from normal children using their resting state Electroencephalography (EEG) signals. One algorithm is based on the univariate features extracted from individual EEG recording channels and the other is based on the multivariate features extracted from brain lobes. We focused on entropy measures as non-linear univariate and multivariate features. Average power, Theta/Beta Ratio (TBR), Shannon Entropy (ShanEn), Sample Entropy (SampEn), Dispersion Entropy (DispEn) and Multiscale SampEn (MSE) were extracted as linear and non-linear univariate features. Besides, multivariate SampEn (mvSE) and multivariate MSE (mvMSE) were extracted as non-linear multivariate features. Classification was followed by three classifiers: Support Vector Machines (SVM) with different kernels, k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) and Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Complexity analysis of multi-channel EEG data was performed using mvMSE approach. Entropy mapping as a useful tool was used to visually track changes of entropies in various brain regions. Based on achieved results, ADHD children have higher brain activity and TBR compared to normal children, while their neural system is more regular. Besides, ADHD children have reduced dynamical complexity of neural system. Finally, the accuracy of 99.58% was achieved in classification based on a combination of non-linear univariate features by Radial Basis Function (RBF) SVM.

Current methods integrate patient history, neuropsychological testing and MRI to identify likely cases, yet effective practices remain variably applied and lacking in sensitivity and specificity. Here we report an interpretable deep learning strategy that delineates unique Alzheimer's disease signatures from multimodal inputs of MRI, age, gender, and Mini-Mental State Examination score. Our framework linked a fully convolutional network, which constructs high resolution maps of disease probability from local brain structure to a multilayer perceptron and generates precise, intuitive visualization of individual Alzheimer's disease risk en route to accurate diagnosis. The model was trained using clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease and cognitively normal subjects from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (n = 417) and validated on three independent cohorts: the Australian Imaging, Biomarker and Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL) (n = 382), the Framingham Heart Study (n = 102), and the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) (n = 582). Performance of the model that used the multimodal inputs was consistent across datasets, with mean area under curve values of 0.996, 0.974, 0.876 and 0.954 for the ADNI study, AIBL, Framingham Heart Study and NACC datasets, respectively. Moreover, our approach exceeded the diagnostic performance of a multi-institutional team of practicing neurologists (n = 11), and high-risk cerebral regions predicted by the model closely tracked post-mortem histopathological findings. This framework provides a clinically adaptable strategy for using routinely available imaging techniques such as MRI to generate nuanced neuroimaging signatures for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, as well as a generalizable approach for linking deep learning to pathophysiological processes in human disease.;0006-8950;1460-2156;;JUN;2020;143;10.1093/brain/awaa137;J

The purpose of this study is to judge whether this combination method of multispectral image and convolutional neural network (CNN) method can be used to distinguish amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and normal controls (NC) with T2DM effectively. Approach. In this study, the authors first combined EEG signals from aMCI patients with T2DM and NC with T2DM on five different frequency bands, including Theta, Alpha1, Alpha2, Beta1, and Beta2.

The spatial properties of EEG signals are highlighted, and its classification performance is found to be better than all the previous methods in the field of aMCI and T2DM diagnosis.

However, it is not difficult to ignore the dynamic interaction patterns of brain regions that essentially change across time. In this study, we take the internal weight information of the brain functional network as a calculation condition of module dividing for brain functional networks. The concept of betweenness efficiency is firstly proposed to improve Girvan-Newman (GN) algorithm for a better module dividing result, and the maximum modularity is used as a criterion to classify the brain functional network modules of normal subjects. The effect of the improved method is verified by controlling subjects, parameters, environment and other conditions. Then, the improved method was utilized to separate the modules in brain functional networks of normal subjects, and the template was used to divide the functional network of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) sufferers. The shortest path length of each module is calculated, and the experimental results are compared with the original GN and weighted GN algorithm improved by Newman. The experimental results demonstrate that, the maximum modularity of the improved method is higher while the dividing effect is better under the same conditions. Meanwhile, the conclusion is consistent with the existing research results when the proposed method is applicable to the analysis of the shortest path length.

The advanced deep learning method, a novel brain imaging technique, was applied in this study to evaluate its contribution to improving the diagnostic accuracy of AD. Three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) were applied with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to execute binary and ternary disease classification models. The dataset from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) was used to compare the deep learning performances across 3D-CNN, 3D-CNN-support vector machine (SVM) and two-dimensional (2D)-CNN models. The outcomes of accuracy with ternary classification for 2D-CNN, 3D-CNN and 3D-CNN-SVM were 82.57 +/- 7.35%, 89.76 +/- 8.67% and 95.74 +/- 2.31% respectively. The 3D-CNN-SVM yielded a ternary classification accuracy of 93.71%, 96.82% and 96.73% for NC, MCI and AD diagnoses, respectively. Furthermore, 3D-CNN-SVM showed the best performance for binary classification. Our study indicated that 'NC versus MCI' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 98.90%, 98.90% and 98.80%; 'NC versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 99.10%, 99.80% and 98.40%; and 'MCI versus AD' showed accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 89.40%, 86.70% and 84.00%, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates that 3D-CNN-SVM yields better performance with MRI compared to currently utilized deep learning methods. In addition, 3D-CNN-SVM proved to be efficient without having to manually perform any prior feature extraction and is totally independent of the variability of imaging protocols and scanners. This suggests that it can potentially be exploited by untrained operators and extended to virtual patient imaging data. Furthermore, owing to the safety, noninvasiveness and nonirradiative properties of the MRI modality, 3D-CNN-SMV may serve as an effective screening option for AD in the general population.

"Shahamat, H; Abadeh, MS";"Shahamat, Hossein; Abadeh, Mohammad Saniee";Brain MRI analysis using a deep learning based evolutionary approach;NEURAL NETWORKS;Convolutional neural network (CNN) models have recently demonstrated impressive performance in medical image analysis. However, there is no clear understanding of why they perform so well, or what they have learned. In this paper, a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN) is employed to classify brain MRI scans into two predefined groups. In addition, a genetic algorithm based brain masking (GABM) method is proposed as a visualization technique that provides new insights into the function of the 3D-CNN. The proposed GABM method consists of two main steps. In the first step, a set of brain MRI scans is used to train the 3D-CNN. In the second step, a genetic algorithm (GA) is applied to discover knowledgeable brain regions in the MRI scans. The knowledgeable regions are those areas of the brain which the 3D-CNN has mostly used to extract important and discriminative features from them. For applying GA on the brain MRI scans, a new chromosome encoding approach is proposed. The proposed framework has been evaluated using ADNI (including 140 subjects for Alzheimer's disease classification) and ABIDE (including 1000 subjects for Autism classification) brain MRI datasets. Experimental results show a 5-fold classification accuracy of 0.85 for the ADNI dataset and 0.70 for the ABIDE dataset. The proposed GABM method has extracted 6 to 65 knowledgeable brain regions in ADNI dataset (and 15 to 75 knowledgeable brain regions in ABIDE dataset). These regions are interpreted as the segments of the brain which are mostly used by the 3D-CNN to extract features for brain disease classification. Experimental results show that besides the model interpretability, the proposed GABM method has increased final performance of the classification model in some cases with respect to model parameters.

These approaches learn abstract neuroanatomical and functional brain alterations that could enable exceptional performance in classification of brain disorders, predicting disease progression, and localizing brain abnormalities. New Method: This work investigates the suitability of a modified form of deep residual neural networks (ResNet) for studying neuroimaging data in the specific application of predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prediction was conducted first by training the deep models using MCI individuals only, followed by a domain transfer learning version that additionally trained on AD and controls. We also demonstrate a network occlusion based method to localize abnormalities. Results: The implemented framework captured non-linear features that successfully predicted AD progression and also conformed to the spectrum of various clinical scores. In a repeated cross-validated setup, the learnt predictive models showed highly similar peak activations that corresponded to previous AD reports. Comparison with existing methods: The implemented architecture achieved a significant performance improvement over the classical support vector machine and the stacked autoencoder frameworks (p < 0.005), numerically better than state-of-the-art performance using sMRI data alone ( > 7% than the second-best performing method) and within 1% of the state-of-the-art performance considering learning using multiple neuroimaging modalities as well. Conclusions: The explored frameworks reflected the high potential of deep learning architectures in learning subtle predictive features and utility in critical applications such as predicting and understanding disease progression.;0165-0270;1872-678X;;JUN 1;2020;339;10.1016/j.jneumeth.2020.108701;J

We investigated whether nilotinib is safe, and detectable in cerebrospinal fluid, and alters biomarkers and clinical decline in Alzheimer's disease. Methods This single-center, phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study investigated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of nilotinib, and measured biomarkers in participants with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. The diagnosis was supported by cerebrospinal fluid or amyloid positron emission tomography biomarkers. Nilotinib 150 mg versus matching placebo was taken orally once daily for 26 weeks followed by nilotinib 300 mg versus placebo for another 26 weeks. Results Of the 37 individuals enrolled, 27 were women and the mean (SD) age was 70.7 (6.48) years. Nilotinib was well-tolerated, although more adverse events, particularly mood swings, were noted with the 300 mg dose. In the nilotinib group, central nervous system (CNS) amyloid burden was significantly reduced in the frontal lobe compared to the placebo group. Cerebrospinal fluid A beta 40 was reduced at 6 months and A beta 42 was reduced at 12 months in the nilotinib group compared to the placebo. Hippocampal volume loss was attenuated (-27%) at 12 months and phospho-tau-181 was reduced at 6 months and 12 months in the nilotinib group. Interpretation Nilotinib is safe and achieves pharmacologically relevant cerebrospinal fluid concentrations. Biomarkers of disease were altered in response to nilotinib treatment. These data support a larger, longer, multicenter study to determine the safety and efficacy of nilotinib in Alzheimer's disease. ANN NEUROL 2020;0364-5134;1531-8249;;JUL;2020;88;10.1002/ana.25775;J

Some MCI patients tend to remain stable over time and do not evolve to AD. It is essential to diagnose MCI in its early stages and provide timely treatment to the patient. In this study, we propose a neuroimaging approach to identify MCI using a deep learning method and functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). For this purpose, fifteen MCI subjects and nine healthy controls (HCs) were asked to perform three mental tasks: N-back, Stroop, and verbal fluency (VF) tasks. Besides examining the oxygenated hemoglobin changes (Delta HbO) in the region of interest, Delta HbO maps at 13 specific time points (i.e., 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, and 65 s) during the tasks and seven temporal feature maps (i.e., two types of mean, three types of slope, kurtosis, and skewness) in the prefrontal cortex were investigated. A four-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) was applied to identify the subjects into either MCI or HC, individually, after training the CNN model with Delta HbO maps and temporal feature maps above. Finally, we used the 5-fold cross-validation approach to evaluate the performance of the CNN. The results of temporal feature maps exhibited high classification accuracies: The average accuracies for the N-back task, Stroop task, and VFT, respectively, were 89.46, 87.80, and 90.37%. Notably, the highest accuracy of 98.61% was achieved from the Delta HbO slope map during 20-60 s interval of N-back tasks. Our results indicate that the fNIRS imaging approach based on temporal feature maps is a promising diagnostic method for early detection of MCI and can be used as a tool for clinical doctors to identify MCI from their patients.;1663-4365;;;MAY 21;2020;12;10.3389/fnagi.2020.00141;J

Among several deep-learning techniques that have been applied to assessing structural brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), convolutional neural network (CNN) has gained popularity due to its superb efficiency in automated feature learning with the use of a variety of multilayer perceptrons. Meanwhile, ensemble learning (EL) has shown to be beneficial in the robustness of learning-system performance via integrating multiple models. Here, we proposed a classifier ensemble developed by combining CNN and EL, i.e., the CNN-EL approach, to identify subjects with MCI or AD using MRI: i.e., classification between (1) AD and healthy cognition (HC), (2) MCIc (MCI patients who will convert to AD) and HC, and (3) MCIc and MCInc (MCI patients who will not convert to AD). For each binary classification task, a large number of CNN models were trained applying a set of sagittal, coronal, or transverse MRI slices; these CNN models were then integrated into a single ensemble. Performance of the ensemble was evaluated using stratified fivefold cross-validation method for 10 times. The number of the intersection points determined by the most discriminable slices separating two classes in a binary classification task among the sagittal, coronal, and transverse slice sets, transformed into the standard Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) space, acted as an indicator to assess the ability of a brain region in which the points were located to classify AD. Thus, the brain regions with most intersection points were considered as those mostly contributing to the early diagnosis of AD. The result revealed an accuracy rate of 0.84 +/- 0.05, 0.79 +/- 0.04, and 0.62 +/- 0.06, respectively, for classifying AD vs. HC, MCIc vs. HC, and MCIc vs. MCInc, comparable to previous reports and a 3D deep learning approach (3D-SENet) based on a more state-of-the-art and popular Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks model using channel attention mechanism. Notably, the intersection points accurately located the medial temporal lobe and several other structures of the limbic system, i.e., brain regions known to be struck early in AD. More interestingly, the classifiers disclosed multiple patterned MRI changes in the brain in AD and MCIc, involving these key regions. These results suggest that as a data-driven method, the combined CNN and EL approach can locate the most discriminable brain regions indicated by the trained ensemble model while the generalization ability of the ensemble model was maximized to successfully capture AD-related brain variations early in the disease process; it can also provide new insights into understanding the complex heterogeneity of whole-brain MRI changes in AD. Further research is needed to examine the clinical implication of the finding, capability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to help understand and evaluate an individual subject's disease status, symptom burden and progress, and the generalizability of the advocated CNN-EL approach to locate the most discriminable brain regions in the detection of other brain disorders such as schizophrenia, autism, and severe depression, in a data-driven way.";;1662-453X;;MAY 13;2020;14;10.3389/fnins.2020.00259;J

So far, the image data input to classifier mainly focus on 2D or 3D images. Although some functional imaging technologies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), generate 4D data which contain both spatial and time-varying information of the brain, for the lack of suitable 4D image processing algorithm, these 4D data were always used by transforming them into functional connectivity or slicing them into 2D/3D pictures which causing apparent information loss. In this paper, we present a 4D deep learning model (C3d-LSTM) for AD discrimination, which is able to utilize the spatial and time-varying information simultaneously by dealing with 4D fMRI data directly. The proposed C3d-LSTM combines a series of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from each volume of 3D static image in fMRI image sequence. Then the feature maps obtained were put into the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to capture the time-varying information contained in the data. Because of the design of structure, C3d-LSTM became an end-to-end data-driven model, which was more convenient for processing 4D fMRI data. The model proposed conducted on the AD Neuroimaging Initiative dataset for algorithm evaluation compared with controlled experiments. Results showed that using 4D fMRI data directly with the proposed method did make a far better result for AD detection than the methods using functional connectivity, 2D, or 3D fMRI data. It demonstrated our assumption that making the most of the natural spatial and temporal information preserved in 4D fMRI data is significant for AD detection and can increase the performance of the classifier. Meanwhile the result implied that the C3d-LSTM model proposed is a suitable model for processing 4D fMRI data and extracting the spatio-temporal property of fMRI data fully for diagnosis of AD.

Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage of AD and its identification is very crucial for early treatment. MCI to AD conversion is of imperative concern in current Alzheimer's research. In this study, we have investigated the conversion from MCI to AD using different types of features. The impact of structural changes in entire brain tissues captured through MRI, genetics, neuropsychological assessment scores and their combination are investigated. Computational cost can be significantly reduced by examining only the hippocampi region, atrophy of which is visible in the earliest stages of the disease. We proposed a CNN based deep learning approach for the prediction of conversion from MCI to AD using above mentioned features. Highest accuracy is achieved when left hippocampus is used as a region of interest (ROI). The proposed technique outperforms the other state of the art methods, while maintaining a low computational cost. The main contribution of the research lies in the fact that only a single slice based small region of MRI is used resulting in an outstanding performance.

However, the predictors and order selection of conventional GC are based on linear models which result in such restrictions as poorly detection of nonlinearity and so on, in the application. This paper proposes a novel GC model called back propagation (BP) based kernel function Granger causality (BP_KFGC), in which symplectic geometry is used for embedding dimension and fuzzy inference system for predicting time series. The proposed method doesn't depend on the prediction of the vector auto-regression model, so that time series don't need to be wide-sense stationary as linear GC and kernel GC. In addition, it is a multivariate approach which is applicable to both linear and nonlinear systems and eliminates the effects of latent variables. The performance of the new method is evaluated and compared with linear GC, partial GC, neural network GC and kernel GC by simulated data with multiple adjustments to the nonlinearity. The results show that BP_KFGC outperforms the other four methods in detecting both linear and nonlinear causalities. Furthermore, we applied BP_KFGC to construct directed weight network (DWN) of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and health controls (HCs), and then nine graph-based features of DWN were used for classification by the classifier of support vector machine with radial basis kernel function.

Thus, specialists can begin preventive treatment as soon as possible. They demand fast and precise assessment in the diagnosis of AD in the earliest and hardest to detect stages. The main objective of this work is to develop a system that automatically detects the presence of the disease in sagittal magnetic resonance images (MRI), which are not generally used. Sagittal MRIs from ADNI and OASIS data sets were employed. Experiments were conducted using Transfer Learning (TL) techniques in order to achieve more accurate results. There are two main conclusions to be drawn from this work: first, the damages related to AD and its stages can be distinguished in sagittal MRI and, second, the results obtained using DL models with sagittal MRIs are similar to the state-of-the-art, which uses the horizontal-plane MRI. Although sagittal-plane MRIs are not commonly used, this work proved that they were, at least, as effective as MRI from other planes at identifying AD in early stages. This could pave the way for further research. Finally, one should bear in mind that in certain fields, obtaining the examples for a data set can be very expensive. This study proved that DL models could be built in these fields, whereas TL is an essential tool for completing the task with fewer examples.;0010-4825;1879-0534;;MAY;2020;120;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2020.103764;J

Previous findings associate increased brain age with neurodegenerative diseases and higher mortality rates. However, the importance of brain age prediction goes beyond serving as biomarkers for neurological disorders. Specifically, utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis to identify brain regions contributing to the prediction can shed light on the complex multivariate process of brain aging. Previous work examined methods to attribute pixel/voxel-wise contributions to the prediction in a single image, resulting in explanation maps that were found noisy and unreliable. To address this problem, we developed an inference scheme for combining these maps across subjects, thus creating a population-based, rather than a subject-specific map. We applied this method to a CNN ensemble trained on predicting subjects' age from raw T1 brain images in a lifespan sample of 10,176 subjects. Evaluating the model on an untouched test set resulted in mean absolute error of 3.07 years and a correlation between chronological and predicted age of r = 0.98. Using the inference method, we revealed that cavities containing cerebrospinal fluid, previously found as general atrophy markers, had the highest contribution for age prediction. Comparing maps derived from different models within the ensemble allowed to assess differences and similarities in brain regions utilized by the model. We showed that this method substantially increased the replicability of explanation maps, converged with results from voxel-based morphometry age studies and highlighted brain regions whose volumetric variability correlated the most with the prediction error.;1065-9471;1097-0193;;AUG 15;2020;41;10.1002/hbm.25011;J

However, most current neural network optimizing strategies focus on internal nodes or hidden layer numbers, while ignoring the advantages of external optimization. Additionally, in the multimodal data fusion analysis of brain science, the problems of small sample size and high-dimensional data are often encountered due to the difficulty of data collection and the specialization of brain science data, which may result in the lower generalization performance of neural network.

The banks of the superior temporal sulcus (BANKSSTS) were found as the highest A beta-affected region, and A beta positivity in this region was defined as above the lowest boundary of BANKSSTS standardized uptake value ratio of A beta+ (ADNI-defined COMPOSITE region) CN individuals. The entire CN cohort was divided as follows: stage 0, BANKSSTS-COMPOSITE-; stage 1, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE-; and stage 2, BANKSSTS+COMPOSITE+. Linear mixed-effect (LME) models investigated subsequent longitudinal cognitive change, and F-18-flortaucipir (FTP)-PET was measured 4.8 +/- 1.6 years later to track tau deposition. Results LME analysis revealed that individuals in stage 1 (n = 64) and stage 2 (n = 99) showed 2.5 (p < 0.05) and 4.8 (p < 0.001) times faster memory decline, respectively, than those in stage 0 (n = 191) over >4 years of mean follow-up.

The pathological progression of AD leads to cortical disconnection. These disconnections may manifest as functional connectivity alterations, measured by the degree of synchronization between different brain regions, and alterations in complex behaviors produced by the interaction among wide-spread brain regions. Recently, machine learning methods, such as clustering algorithms and classification methods, have been adopted to detect disease-related changes in functional connectivity and classify the features of these changes. Although complexity of EEG signals can also reflect AD-related changes, few machine learning studies have focused on the changes in complexity. Therefore, in this study, we compared the ability of EEG signals to detect characteristics of AD using different machine learning approaches one focused on functional connectivity and the other focused on signal complexity. We examined functional connectivity, estimated by phase lag index (PLI) in EEG signals in healthy older participants [healthy control (HC)] and patients with AD. We estimated signal complexity using multi-scale entropy. Utilizing a support vector machine, we compared the identification accuracy of AD based on functional connectivity at each frequency band and complexity component. Additionally, we evaluated the relationship between synchronization and complexity. The identification accuracy of functional connectivity of the alpha, beta, and gamma bands was significantly high (AUC 1.0), and the identification accuracy of complexity was sufficiently high (AUC 0.81). Moreover, the relationship between functional connectivity and complexity exhibited various temporal-scale-and-regional-specific dependency in both HC participants and patients with AD. In conclusion, the combination of functional connectivity and complexity might reflect complex pathological process of AD. Applying a combination of both machine learning methods to neurophysiological data may provide a novel understanding of the neural network processes in both healthy brains and pathological conditions.;1664-0640;;;APR 7;2020;11;10.3389/fpsyt.2020.00255;J

The exact neural basis of the hub, regions and connectivity remains unclear. Semantic dementia could be an ideal lesion model to construct the semantic network as this disease presents both amodal and modality-specific semantic processing (e.g. colour) deficits. The goal of the present study was to identify, using an unbiased data-driven approach, the semantic hub and its general and modality-specific semantic white matter connections by investigating the relationship between the lesion degree of the network and the severity of semantic deficits in 33 patients with semantic dementia. Data of diffusion-weighted imaging and behavioural performance in processing knowledge of general semantic and six sensorimotor modalities (i.e. object form, colour, motion, sound, manipulation and function) were collected from each subject. Specifically, to identify the semantic hub, we mapped the white matter nodal degree value (a graph theoretical index) of the 90 regions in the automated anatomical labelling atlas with the general semantic abilities of the patients. Of the regions, only the left fusiform gyrus was identified as the hub because its structural connectivity strength (i.e. nodal degree value) could significantly predict the general semantic processing of the patients. To identify the general and modalityspecific semantic connections of the semantic hub, we separately correlated the white matter integrity values of each tract connected with the left fusiform gyrus, with the performance for general semantic processing and each of six semantic modality processing. The results showed that the hub region worked in concert with nine other regions in the semantic memory network for general semantic processing. Moreover, the connection between the hub and the left calcarine was associated with colour-specific semantic processing. The observed effects could not be accounted for by potential confounding variables (e.g. total grey matter volume, regional grey matter volume and performance on non-semantic control tasks). Our findings refine the neuroanatomical structure of the semantic network and underline the critical role of the left fusiform gyrus and its connectivity in the network.;0006-8950;1460-2156;;APR;2020;143;10.1093/brain/awaa057;J

In this study, we synthesized 18F-Florbetaben (FBB) images using CGAN. The generated images were evaluated using various measures, and we presented the state of the images and the similarity value of quantitative measurement that can be expected to successfully augment data from generated images for DA. The method includes (1) conditional WGAN-GP to learn the axial image distribution extracted from pre-processed 3D FBB images, (2) pre-trained DenseNet121 and model-agnostic metrics for visual and quantitative measurements of generated image distribution, and (3) a machine learning model for observing improvement in generalization performance by generated dataset. The Visual Turing test showed similarity in the descriptions of typical patterns of amyloid deposition for each of the generated images. However, differences in similarity and classification performance per axial level were observed, which did not agree with the visual evaluation. Experimental results demonstrated that quantitative measurements were able to detect the similarity between two distributions and observe mode collapse better than the Visual Turing test and t-SNE.;;2076-3417;;APR;2020;10;10.3390/app10072628;J

We aim to review current developments in MRI quantitative markers and their potential in a clinical and neuroscientific setting. Recent findings There have been efforts to improve MRI acquisition methods and to explore new promising biomarkers. In parallel, technological advances in data analysis (i.e. deep learning) open new ways to use these biomarkers. The MRI markers may differ according to the brain structure investigated. Even if the newly adopted acquisition protocols served mainly the development of brainstem-related biomarkers (neuromelanin MRI, nigrosome sensitive MRI), more established markers (e.g. morphometric values) in basal ganglia, cortex and cerebellum demonstrate their relevance especially to differential diagnosis in parkinsonian syndromes. We provide an overview on recent advances in MRI quantitative markers of Parkinson's disease that we divide for didactic purposes in three anatomical levels - cortical/cerebellum structures, basal ganglia and brainstem. We show the complementarity of new biomarkers sensitive to brain tissue properties to established morphometrics.;1350-7540;1473-6551;;APR;2020;33;10.1097/WCO.0000000000000796;J

In this review, we argue that computational models can be both relevant and useful in neurodegenerative disease research and although the current established models have limitations in clinical practice, artificial intelligence has the potential to overcome deficiencies encountered by these models, which in turn can improve our understanding of disease. Recent findings In recent years, diverse computational approaches have been used to shed light on different aspects of neurodegenerative disease models. For example, linear and nonlinear mixed models, self-modeling regression, differential equation models, and event-based models have been applied to provide a better understanding of disease progression patterns and biomarker trajectories. Additionally, the Cox-regression technique, Bayesian network models, and deep-learning-based approaches have been used to predict the probability of future incidence of disease, whereas nonnegative matrix factorization, nonhierarchical cluster analysis, hierarchical agglomerative clustering, and deep-learning-based approaches have been employed to stratify patients based on their disease subtypes. Furthermore, the interpretation of neurodegenerative disease data is possible through knowledge-based models which use prior knowledge to complement data-driven analyses. These knowledge-based models can include pathway-centric approaches to establish pathways perturbed in a given condition, as well as disease-specific knowledge maps, which elucidate the mechanisms involved in a given disease. Collectively, these established models have revealed high granular details and insights into neurodegenerative disease models. In conjunction with increasingly advanced computational approaches, a wide spectrum of neurodegenerative disease models, which can be broadly categorized into data-driven and knowledge-driven, have been developed. We review the state of the art data and knowledge-driven models and discuss the necessary steps which are vital to bring them into clinical application.;1350-7540;1473-6551;;APR;2020;33;10.1097/WCO.0000000000000795;J

From a research point of view, impressive results have been reported using computer-aided algorithms, but clinically no practical diagnostic method is available. In recent years, deep models have become popular, especially in dealing with images. Since 2013, deep learning has begun to gain considerable attention in AD detection research, with the number of published papers in this area increasing drastically since 2017. Deep models have been reported to be more accurate for AD detection compared to general machine learning techniques. Nevertheless, AD detection is still challenging, and for classification, it requires a highly discriminative feature representation to separate similar brain patterns. This paper reviews the current state of AD detection using deep learning. Through a systematic literature review of over 100 articles, we set out the most recent findings and trends. Specifically, we review useful biomarkers and features (personal information, genetic data, and brain scans), the necessary pre-processing steps, and different ways of dealing with neuroimaging data originating from single-modality and multi-modality studies. Deep models and their performance are described in detail. Although deep learning has achieved notable performance in detecting AD, there are several limitations, especially regarding the availability of datasets and training procedures.

However, it remains unclear which feature of EEG signals is best effective in assessing amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) when combining one classifier. This study proposed a novel feature extraction method of EEG signals named feature-fusion multispectral image method (FMIM) for diagnosis of aMCI with T2DM. The FMIM was integrated with convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify the processed multispectral image data. The results showed that FMIM could effectively identify aMCI with T2DM from the control group compared to existing multispectral image method (MIM), with improvements including the type and quantity of feature extraction. Meanwhile, part of the invalid calculation could be avoided during the classification process. In addition, the classification evaluation indexes were best under the combination of Alpha2-Beta1-Beta2 frequency bands in data set based on FMIM-1, and were also best under the combination of the Theta-Alphal-Alpha2-Beta1-Beta2 frequency bands in data set based on FMIM-2. Therefore, FMIM can be used as an effective feature extraction method of aMCI with T2DM, and as a valuable biomarker in clinical applications. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this work was to deliver a robust classification system for AD and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) against healthy controls (HC) in a low-cost network in terms of shallow architecture and processing. In this study, the dataset included was downloaded from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI). The classification methodology implemented was the convolutional neural network (CNN), where the diffusion maps, and gray-matter (GM) volumes were the input images. The number of scans included was 185, 106, and 115 for HC, MCI and AD respectively.

Blocking the overexcitation of the neural network may be a promising new strategy to prevent, halt, and even reverse this condition. Physical exercise has been shown to be an effective cognitive enhancer that reduces the risk of AD in elderly individuals, but the underlying mechanisms are far from being fully understood. We explored whether long-term treadmill exercise attenuates amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mutation-induced aberrant network activity and thus improves cognition by altering the numbers and/or distribution of voltage-gated sodium channels (Nav) in transgenic mice. APP/PS1 mice aged 2, 3.5, 5, 6.5, 8, and 9 months underwent treadmill exercise with different durations or at different stages of AD. The alterations in memory, electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings, and expression levels and distributions of Nav functional members (Nav1.1 alpha, Nav1.2, Nav1.6, and Nav beta 2) were evaluated. The results revealed that treadmill exercise with 12- and 24-week durations 1) induced significant improvement in novel object recognition (NOR) memory and Morris water maze (MWM) spatial memory; 2) partially reduced abnormal spike activity; and 3) redressed the disturbed cellular distribution of Nav1.1 alpha, aberrant Nav beta 2 cleavage augmentation, and Nav1.6 upregulation. Additionally, APP/PS1 mice in the 24-week exercise group showed better performance in the NOR task and a large decrease in Nav1.6 expression, which was close to the wild-type level. This study suggests that exercise improves cognition and neural activity by altering the numbers and distribution of hippocampal Nav in APP/PS1 mice.

Methods To objectivize the radiological evaluation of patients with suspected AD, head-to-head multi-modality imaging studies were conducted using MRI and PET/CT with [F-18]FDG and [F-18]AV45 for visualization and quantitation of brain morphology, glucose metabolism, and amyloid levels, respectively. A total of 84 subjects was studied, including 33 patients with AD, 31 patients with MCI, and 20 age-matched healthy controls (HC). A new quantitative index was calculated as a ratio of regional SUV of [F-18]AV45 (normalized to cerebellar cortex) over the corresponding regional SUV of [F-18]FDG, divided by the corresponding regional volume, measured from the co-registered MRI and normalized to the normal age-matched control group (AV45/FDG/NVol index). Relationships between clinical scores (TMSE, ADAS) and AV45/FDG/NVol indices for different structures of the brain in study groups were determined using linear regression analyses. Results A significant direct linear correlation was observed between the AV45/FDG/NVol index and ADAS-Cog test score and an inverse correlation with TMSE score at baseline and with the degree of changes in ADAS and TMSE scores assessed one year later (disease progression). The observed correlations between AV45/FDG/NVol index and clinical scores were higher than those with MRI-based cortical volumes, FDG SUV, or cerebellum-normalized AV45 SUV alone. Conclusions Current study demonstrated that AV45/FDG/NVol index mapping of the brain is a novel quantitative molecular imaging biomarker that correlates with clinical neurocognitive status and may facilitate more accurate diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of AD. Additional larger scale clinical studies are required to further evaluate the efficacy of this new quantitative index as a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker of AD as well as for the evaluation of safety and efficacy of novel agents undergoing clinical trials for therapy of AD.;0914-7187;1864-6433;;MAY;2020;34;10.1007/s12149-020-01453-y;J

Brain-predicted age difference scores were significantly negatively correlated with performance on measures of general cognitive status (two datasets); processing speed, visual attention, and cognitive flexibility (three datasets); visual attention and cognitive flexibility (two datasets); and semantic verbal fluency (two datasets).

Through a sequence modeling method, we examine the emotion recognition performance based on the learnt latent factors. The performance of the proposed methodology is verified on two public datasets (DEAP and SEED) and compared with traditional matrix factorization-based (ICA) and autoencoder-based approaches. Experimental results demonstrate that autoencoder-like neural networks are suitable for unsupervised EEG modeling, and our proposed emotion recognition framework achieves an inspiring performance. As far as we know, it is the first work that introduces variational autoencoder into multichannel EEG decoding for emotion recognition.

This method can be applied to areas such as brain tissue segmentation and volumetric measurement, longitudinal analysis, multiple sclerosis analysis, cortical and sub-cortical analysis, assessing schizophrenia, and for the planning of neurosurgical interventions. Abstract Skull stripping in brain magnetic resonance volume has recently been attracting attention due to an increased demand to develop an efficient, accurate, and general algorithm for diverse datasets of the brain. Accurate skull stripping is a critical step for neuroimaging diagnostic systems because neither the inclusion of non-brain tissues nor removal of brain parts can be corrected in subsequent steps, which results in unfixed error through subsequent analysis. The objective of this review article is to give a comprehensive overview of skull stripping approaches, including recent deep learning-based approaches. In this paper, the current methods of skull stripping have been divided into two distinct groups-conventional or classical approaches, and convolutional neural networks or deep learning approaches. The potentials of several methods are emphasized because they can be applied to standard clinical imaging protocols.

Furthermore, deep learning models based on 2D view and 3D view have been widely used in the diagnosis of MCI. The deep learning architecture can capture anatomical changes in the brain from MRI scans to extract the underlying features of brain disease. In this paper, we propose a multi-view based multi-model (MVMM) learning framework, which effectively combines the local information of 2D images with the global information of 3D images. First, we select some 2D slices from MRI images and extract the features representing 2D local information.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a clinical precursor of AD. Although some treatments can delay its progression, no effective cures are available for AD. Accurate early-stage diagnosis of AD is vital for the prevention and intervention of the disease progression. Hippocampus is one of the first affected brain regions in AD. To help AD diagnosis, the shape and volume of the hippocampus are often measured using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, these features encode limited information and may suffer from segmentation errors. Additionally, the extraction of these features is independent of the classification model, which could result in sub-optimal performance. In this study, we propose a multi-model deep learning framework based on convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint automatic hippocampal segmentation and AD classification using structural MRI data. Firstly, a multi-task deep CNN model is constructed for jointly learning hippocampal segmentation and disease classification. Then, we construct a 3D Densely Connected Convolutional Networks (3D DenseNet) to learn features of the 3D patches extracted based on the hippocampal segmentation results for the classification task. Finally, the learned features from the multi-task CNN and DenseNet models are combined to classify disease status. Our method is evaluated on the baseline T1-weighted structural MRI data collected from 97 AD, 233 MCI, 119 Normal Control (NC) subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The proposed method achieves a dice similarity coefficient of 87.0% for hippocampal segmentation. In addition, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.9% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.5% for classifying AD vs. NC subjects, and an accuracy of 76.2% and an AUC of 77.5% for classifying MCI vs. NC subjects. Our empirical study also demonstrates that the proposed multi-model method outperforms the single-model methods and several other competing methods.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;MAR;2020;208;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116459;J
"Ieracitano, C; Mammone, N; Hussain, A; Morabito, FC";"Ieracitano, Cosimo; Mammone, Nadia; Hussain, Amir; Morabito, Francesco C.";A novel multi-modal machine learning based approach for automatic classification of EEG recordings in dementia;NEURAL NETWORKS;Electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings generate an electrical map of the human brain that are useful for clinical inspection of patients and in biomedical smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) and BrainComputer Interface (BCI) applications. From a signal processing perspective, EEGs yield a nonlinear and nonstationary, multivariate representation of the underlying neural circuitry interactions. In this paper, a novel multi-modal Machine Learning (ML) based approach is proposed to integrate EEG engineered features for automatic classification of brain states. EEGs are acquired from neurological patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the aim is to discriminate Healthy Control (HC) subjects from patients. Specifically, in order to effectively cope with nonstationarities, 19-channels EEG signals are projected into the time-frequency (TF) domain by means of the Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) and a set of appropriate features (denoted as CWT features) are extracted from delta, theta, alpha(1), alpha(2), beta EEG sub-bands. Furthermore, to exploit nonlinear phase-coupling information of EEG signals, higher order statistics (HOS) are extracted from the bispectrum (BiS) representation. BiS generates a second set of features (denoted as BiS features) which are also evaluated in the five EEG sub-bands. The CWT and BiS features are fed into a number of ML classifiers to perform both 2-way (AD vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, MCI vs. HC) and 3-way (AD vs. MCI vs. HC) classifications. As an experimental benchmark, a balanced EEG dataset that includes 63 AD, 63 MCI and 63 HC is analyzed. Comparative results show that when the concatenation of CWT and BiS features (denoted as multimodal (CWT+BiS) features) is used as input, the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier outperforms all other models, specifically, the Autoencoder (AE), Logistic Regression (LR) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Consequently, our proposed multi-modal ML scheme can be considered a viable alternative to state-of-the-art computationally intensive deep learning approaches. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

OCC needs samples from only one class to train the model. Most recently, kernel regularized least squares (KRL) method-based deep architecture is developed for the OCC task. This paper introduces a novel extension of this method by embedding minimum variance information within this architecture. This embedding improves the generalization capability of the classifier by reducing the intra-class variance. In contrast to traditional deep learning methods, this method can effectively work with small-size datasets. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on 18 benchmark datasets (13 biomedical and 5 other datasets) to demonstrate the performance of the proposed classifier. We compare the results with 16 state-of-the-art one-class classifiers. Further, we also test our method for 2 real-world biomedical datasets viz.; detection of Alzheimer's disease from structural magnetic resonance imaging data and detection of breast cancer from histopathological images. Proposed method exhibits more than 5% F-1 score compared to existing state-of-the-art methods for various biomedical benchmark datasets. This makes it viable for application in biomedical fields where relatively less amount of data is available. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Right now there is no cure for AD. As we know, the brain structure is constantly changing as it progresses to AD. If we can detect these changes, it may be helpful to discover new biomarkers and early diagnosis of AD. We use the deep learning method DeepWalk to extract the structural features of each subject based on brain function connection. The method takes a brain topology network based on functional connection transformations as input and outputs a potential feature representation for each brain region in the brain network structure. In the current research, a new potential biomarker is found, which is based on a structural feature that can represent changes in brain connectivity. In our experiment, 79 Resting-state fMRI were used from ADNI dataset, including 49 normal controls (NCs) and 30 AD patients. By analyzing the structural features between AD patients and NCs, obvious differences are detected in the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and frontal lobe. We use a support vector machine (SVM) model to evaluate the performance of these structural features, and its classification performance achieves 80.36% accuracy (specificity = 73.67%, sensitivity = 87.17%).

Although deep learning has a good effect on feature extraction, the current deep learning methods usually need to set a large number of parameters manually, which is time consuming. Hierarchical extreme learning machine (H-ELM) needs only less manual intervention and can extract features by a multi-layer feature representation framework, which is much faster than the traditional deep learning methods. A CADx framework based on H-ELM, named DCADx, is proposed. As common spatial pattern (CSP) and brain functional network (BFN) have been proven to have better de-redundancy effects on brain data, the DCADx contains two different data redundancy reduction methods: (1) CSP-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-CSP model) and (2) BFN-based DCADx (i.e., DCADx-BFN model). The experimental evaluation proved the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. The DCADx-CSP model obtained 83.2% on Alzheimer's disease and 82.5% on Parkinson's disease. The DCADx-BFN obtained 89.3% on Alzheimer's disease and 88.7% on Parkinson's disease. DCADx can make full use of the feature expression ability of H-ELM to achieve better performance.

Our motivation comes from the problem of aligning 3D brain MRI with 100-micron isotropic resolution to histology sections at 1 x 1 x 1,000-micron resolution with multiple varying stains. We pose registration as a penalized Bayesian estimation, exploiting statistical models of image formation where the target images are modeled as sparse and noisy observations of the atlas. In this injective setting, there is no assumption of symmetry between atlas and target. Cross-modality image matching is achieved by jointly estimating polynomial transformations of the atlas intensity. Missing data is accommodated via a multiple atlas selection procedure where several atlas images may be of homogeneous intensity and correspond to background or artifact. The two concepts are combined within an Expectation-Maximization algorithm, where atlas selection posteriors and deformation parameters are updated iteratively and polynomial coefficients are computed in closed form. We validate our method with simulated images, examples from neuropathology, and a standard benchmarking dataset. Finally, we apply it to reconstructing digital pathology and MRI in standard atlas coordinates. By using a standard convolutional neural network to detect tau tangles in histology slices, this registration method enabled us to quantify the 3D density distribution of tauopathy throughout the medial temporal lobe of an Alzheimer's disease postmortem specimen.;;1662-453X;;FEB 11;2020;14;10.3389/fnins.2020.00052;J

Methods Patients with MS (n = 16) and controls (n = 80) matched for age, sex, and APOE epsilon 4 status from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging who underwent PiB PET imaging were studied. Of these individuals, 12 patients with MS and 60 matching controls also underwent AV1451 tau PET. Cortical PiB and AV1451 standard uptake value ratios (SUVrs) from the entire cortex and previously determined Alzheimer disease (AD) signature regions in the same population were calculated for group comparisons and testing for associations with age. Results AD signature PiB SUVr (odds ratio [OR] [95% confidence interval (CI)] = 0.52 [0.27-0.98], p = 0.044), total cortical PiB SUVr (OR [95% CI] = 0.52 [0.28-0.99], p = 0.048), and the frequency of abnormal PiB SUVrs (OR [95% CI] = 0.10 [0.01-0.90], p = 0.040) were lower in MS than controls. Although AD-signature and total cortical AV1451 SUVrs were not different between the groups, the frequency of abnormal AV1451 SUVrs was higher (OR [95% CI] = 10.65 [1.10-103.35], p = 0.041) in MS than controls. The association of AD signature PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = -0.14 [-0.023 to -0.006], p = 0.002). Similarly, the association of total cortical PiB SUVr with age was steeper in the controls compared to patients with MS (estimate [95% CI] = -0.13 [-0.021 to -0.005], p = 0.002). There was no difference in the association of AV1451 SUVr findings with age between the MS patients and controls. Interpretation Although both beta-amyloid and tau are biomarkers of cognitive aging and AD, cortical beta-amyloid deposition was lower in MS than age-matched controls, suggesting that some aspect of MS pathobiology retards the accumulation of beta-amyloid but not the accumulation of tau.

Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) would provide abundant information on the anatomical structure of human organs. Fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (PET) obtains the metabolic activity of the brain. Previous studies have demonstrated that multi-modality images could contribute to improve diagnosis of AD. However, these methods need to extract the handcrafted features that demand domain specific knowledge and image processing stage is time consuming. In order to tackle these problems, in this study, the authors propose a novel framework that ensembles three state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) with multi-modality images for AD classification. In detail, they extract some slices from each subject of each modality, and every DCNN generates a probabilistic score for the input slices. Furthermore, a 'dropout' mechanism is introduced to discard low discrimination slices of the category probabilities. Then average reserved slices of each subject are acquired as a new feature. Finally, they train the Adaboost ensemble classifier based on single decision tree classifier with the MRI and PET probabilistic scores of each DCNN. Evaluations on Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database show that the proposed algorithm has better performance compared to existing method, the algorithm proposed in this study significantly improved the classification accuracy.;1751-9659;1751-9667;;FEB 7;2020;14;10.1049/iet-ipr.2019.0617;J

In this paper, we propose an accurate classification method for scoring brain amyloid plaque load (BAPL) based on deep convolutional neural networks. A joint discriminative loss function was formulated by adding a discriminative intra-loss function to the conventional (cross-entropy) loss function. The performance of the proposed joint loss function was compared with that of the conventional loss function in three state-of-the-art deep neural network architectures. The intra-loss function significantly improved the BAPL classification performance.

We propose a novel CNN framework to simultaneously learn embedded features from BFNs for brain disease diagnosis. Since BFNs can be built by considering both static and dynamic functional connectivity (FC), we first decompose rs-fMRI into multiple static BFNs with modified independent component analysis. Then, the voxel-wise variability in dynamic FC is used to quantify BFN dynamics. A set of paired 3D images representing static/dynamic BFNs can be fed into 3D CNNs, from which we can hierarchically and simultaneously learn static/dynamic BFN features. As a result, the dynamic BFN features can complement static BFN features and, at the meantime, different BFNs can help each other toward a joint and better classification. We validate our method with a publicly accessible, large cohort of rs-fMRI dataset in early-stage mild cognitive impairment (eMCI) diagnosis, which is one of the most challenging problems to the clinicians. By comparing with a conventional method, our method shows significant diagnostic performance improvement by almost. This result demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning in preclinical Alzheimers disease diagnosis, based on the complex and high-dimensional voxel-wise spatiotemporal patterns of the resting-state brain functional connectomics. The framework provides a new but intuitive way to fully exploit deeply embedded diagnostic features from rs-fMRI for a better-individualized diagnosis of various neurological diseases.;0278-0062;1558-254X;;FEB;2020;39;10.1109/TMI.2019.2928790;J

A clinically relevant issue is the selection of high-risk subjects who need active surveillance among equivocal cases. We validated the clinical feasibility of DL compared with visual rating or quantitative measurement for assessing the diagnosis and prognosis of subjects with equivocal amyloid scans. Methods F-18-florbetaben scans of 430 cases (85 NC, 233 mild cognitive impairment, and 112 AD) were assessed through visual rating-based, quantification-based, and DL-based methods. DL was trained using 280 two-dimensional PET images (80%) and tested by randomly assigning the remaining (70 cases, 20%) cases and a clinical validation set of 54 equivocal cases. In the equivocal cases, we assessed the agreement among the visual rating, quantification, and DL and compared the clinical outcome according to each modality-based amyloid status. Results The visual reading was positive in 175 cases, equivocal in 54 cases, and negative in 201 cases. The composite SUVR cutoff value was 1.32 (AUC 0.99). The subject-level performance of DL using the test set was 100%. Among the 54 equivocal cases, 37 cases were classified as positive (Eq(deep+)) by DL, 40 cases were classified by a second-round visual assessment, and 40 cases were classified by quantification. The DL- and quantification-based classifications showed good agreement (83%, kappa = 0.59). The composite SUVRs differed between Eq(deep+) (1.47 [0.13]) and Eq(deep-) (1.29 [0.10]; P < 0.001).

To this end, we developed a deep learning-based cognitive signature of FDG brain PET adaptable for Parkinson's disease (PD) as well as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods A deep learning model for discriminating AD from normal controls (NCs) was built by a training set consisting of 636 FDG PET obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The model was directly transferred to images of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients (n = 666) for identifying who would rapidly convert to AD and another independent cohort consisting of 62 PD patients to differentiate PD patients with dementia. The model accuracy was measured by area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The relationship between all images was visualized by two-dimensional projection of the deep learning-based features. The model was also designed to predict cognitive score of the subjects and validated in PD patients. Cognitive dysfunction-related regions were visualized by feature maps of the deep CNN model. Results AUC of ROC for differentiating AD from NC was 0.94 (95% CI 0.89-0.98). The transfer of the model could differentiate MCI patients who would convert to AD (AUC = 0.82) and PD with dementia (AUC = 0.81). The two-dimensional projection mapping visualized the degree of cognitive dysfunction compared with normal brains regardless of different disease cohorts. Predicted cognitive score, an output of the model, was highly correlated with the mini-mental status exam scores. Individual cognitive dysfunction-related regions included cingulate and high frontoparietal cortices, while they showed individual variability. Conclusion The deep learning-based cognitive function evaluation model could be successfully transferred to multiple disease domains. We suggest that this approach might be extended to an objective cognitive signature that provides quantitative biomarker for cognitive dysfunction across various neurodegenerative disorders.;1619-7070;1619-7089;;FEB;2020;47;10.1007/s00259-019-04538-7;J

The results showed that in terms of the MCI transformation prediction, the sensitivity and specificity of conv3 classification were respectively 91.02% and 77.63%; in terms of the Late Mild Cognitive Impairment (LMCI) and Early Mild Cognitive Impairment (EMCI) classification, the accuracy of conv5 classification was 72.19%, and the sensitivity and specificity of conv5 were all 73% approximately. Thus, it was seen that the model constructed in the research could be used to solve the problems of MCI transformation prediction, which also had certain effects on the classifications of EMCI and LMCI. The risk prediction of AD based on the deep learning model of brain 18F-FDG PET discussed in the research matched the expected results. It provided a relatively accurate reference model for the prediction of AD. Despite the deficiencies of the research process, the research results have provided certain references and guidance for the future exploration of accurate AD prediction model; therefore, the research is of great significance.

This work introduces a new highly accurate and versatile method based on 3D convolutional neural networks for the automatic segmentation of neuroanatomy in T1-weighted MRI. In combination with a deep 3D fully convolutional architecture, efficient linear registration-derived spatial priors are used to incorporate additional spatial context into the network. An aggressive data augmentation scheme using random elastic deformations is also used to regularize the networks, allowing for excellent performance even in cases where only limited labeled training data are available. Applied to hippocampus segmentation in an elderly population (mean Dice coefficient = 92.1%) and subcortical segmentation in a healthy adult population (mean Dice coefficient = 89.5%), we demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracies and a high robustness to outliers. Further validation on a multistructure segmentation task in a scan-rescan dataset demonstrates accuracy (mean Dice coefficient = 86.6%) similar to the scan-rescan reliability of expert manual segmentations (mean Dice coefficient = 86.9%), and improved reliability compared to both expert manual segmentations and automated segmentations using FIRST.

Therefore, diagnosis of AD has been mostly performed by analyzing brain images such as magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological tests. Identifying the molecular-level mechanism of AD has been lacking data owing to the difficulty of sampling in the posterior brains of normal and AD patients; however, recent studies have produced and analyzed large-scale omics data for brain areas such as prefrontal cortex. Therefore, it is necessary to develop AD diagnosis or prediction methods based on these data. Results: This paper proposed a deep learning-based model that can predict AD using large-scale gene expression and DNA methylation data. The most challenging problem in constructing a model to diagnose AD based on the multi-omics dataset is how to integrate different omics data and how to deal with high-dimensional and low-sample-size data. To solve this problem, we proposed a novel but simple approach to reduce the number of features based on a differentially expressed gene and a differentially methylated position in the multi-omics dataset. Moreover, we developed a deep neural network-based prediction model that improves performance compared to that of conventional machine learning algorithms. The feature selection method and the prediction model presented in this paper outperformed conventional machine learning algorithms, which utilize typical dimension reduction methods. In addition, we demonstrated that integrating gene expression and DNA methylation data could improve the prediction accuracy. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Some automatic segmentation tools are already being used, but, in recent years, new deep learning (DL)-based methods have been proven to be much more accurate in various medical image segmentation tasks. In this work, we propose a DL-based hippocampus segmentation framework that embeds statistical shape of the hippocampus as context information into the deep neural network (DNN). The inclusion of shape information is achieved with three main steps: (1) a U-Net-based segmentation, (2) a shape model estimation, and (3) a second U-Net-based segmentation which uses both the original input data and the fitted shape model. The trained DL architectures were tested on image data of three diagnostic groups [AD patients, subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and controls] from two cohorts (ADNI and AddNeuroMed). Both intra-cohort validation and cross-cohort validation were performed and compared with the conventional U-net architecture and some variations with other types of context information (i.e., autocontext and tissue-class context). Our results suggest that adding shape information can improve the segmentation accuracy in cross-cohort validation, i.e., when DNNs are trained on one cohort and applied to another. However, no significant benefit is observed in intra-cohort validation, i.e., training and testing DNNs on images from the same cohort. Moreover, compared to other types of context information, the use of shape context was shown to be the most successful in increasing the accuracy, while keeping the computational time in the order of a few minutes.;;1662-453X;;JAN 24;2020;14;10.3389/fnins.2020.00015;J

However, there has been little research on (1) the reproducibility and test-retest reliability of SPs derived from RBMs and on (2) hierarchical SPs derived from DBNs. Methods: We applied a weight sparsity-controlled RBM and DBN to whole-brain rfMRI data from the Human Connectome Project. We evaluated the within-session reproducibility and between-session test-retest reliability of the SPs derived from the RBM approach and compared them both with those identified using independent component analysis (ICA) and with three voxel-wise statistical measures-the Hurst exponent, entropy, and kurtosis-of the rfMRI data. We also assessed the potential hierarchy of the SPs from the DBN. Results: An increase in the sparsity level of the RBM weights enhanced the reproducibility of the SPs. The SPs deriving from a stringent weight sparsity level were predominantly found in the cortical gray matter and substantially overlapped with the SPs obtained from the Hurst exponent. A hierarchical representation was shown by constructed using the default-mode network obtained from the DBN. Comparison with existing methods: The test-retest reliability of the SPs from the RBM was superior to that of the SPs from the voxel-wise statistics. Conclusions: The SPs from the RBM were reproducible within sessions and reliable across sessions. The hierarchically organized SPs from the DBN could possibly be applied to research based on rfMRI data.";0165-0270;1872-678X;;JAN 15;2020;330;10.1016/j.jneumeth.2019.108451;J

Tau, one of the major proteins implicated in AD pathology, is an important regulator of neural network excitability and might participate in the underlying epileptic cascade. However, the mechanisms underlying this relationship are not fully elucidated. We aim to investigate this mechanism by analyzing seizure susceptibility to the convulsant pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) in a novel rodent tauopathy model. A single dose of PTZ was systemically injected in Tau58/4 transgenic mice. To investigate whether young and aged heterozygous (HET) mice exhibit a higher susceptibility to seizures in comparison with wild-type (WT) littermates, video electroencephalography (EEG) in combination with behavioral scoring according to a modified Racine scale was used. The employment of different dosage groups enabled us to characterize the dose range reliably inducing seizures. Here, we report an increased seizure susceptibility in young but not in old HET Tau58/4 mice. Young HET animals displayed more severe seizures and had a reduced latency to the first seizure compared to WTs. Also, age-related differences in susceptibility could be demonstrated for both genotypes. Identification and targeting of secondary diseases such as epilepsy, which aggravate dementia and lead to earlier institutionalization, is key. This study finds that tau pathology itself is sufficient to alter seizure susceptibility in a rodent model, indicating that the disease process is crucial in the emergence of epilepsy in patients with tauopathy.

There is significant variation in cognitive changes in the presence of pathology, functional connectivity may be a marker of compensation to amyloid; however, this is not well understood. Methods We recruited 64 cognitively normal older adults who underwent neuropsychological testing and biannual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), amyloid imaging with Pittsburgh compound B (PiB)-PET, and glucose metabolism (FDG)-PET imaging for up to 6 years. Resting-state MRI was used to estimate connectivity of seven canonical neural networks using template-based rotation. Using voxel-wise paired t-tests, we identified neural networks that displayed significant changes in connectivity across time. We investigated associations among amyloid and longitudinal changes in connectivity and cognitive function by domains. Results Left middle frontal gyrus connectivity within the memory encoding network increased over time, but the rate of change was lower with greater amyloid. This was no longer significant in an analysis where we limited the sample to only those with two time points. We found limited decline in cognitive domains overall. Greater functional connectivity was associated with better attention/processing speed and executive function (independent of time) in those with lower amyloid but was associated with worse function with greater amyloid. Conclusions Increased functional connectivity serves to preserve cognitive function in normal aging and may fail in the presence of pathology consistent with compensatory models.";;1758-9193;;JAN 6;2020;12;10.1186/s13195-019-0573-1;J

Methods We investigated the associations between personality and resting-state functional MRI data from 365 individuals across the adult lifespan (20-80 years).

Within-network connectivity values were computed based on predefined networks. Regression analyzes were conducted in order to investigate personality-connectivity associations, as well as moderation by age. All models controlled for potential confounders (such as age, sex, education, IQ, and the other personality traits). Results We found that openness was positively associated with connectivity in the default-mode network, neuroticism was negatively associated with both the ventral and dorsal attention networks, and agreeableness was negatively associated with the dorsal attention network. In addition, age moderated the association between conscientiousness and the frontoparietal network, indicating that this association become stronger in older age.

The involvement of different neural networks may explain these distinct clinical phenotypes. In this study, we tested the hypothesis of an early and selective involvement of neural networks based on AAO in AD. Twenty memory clinic patients with prodromal AD (i.e., mild cognitive impairment with an AD-like cerebrospinal fluid profile) and 30 healthy controls underwent a cognitive evaluation and a resting state functional MRI exam. Independent component analysis was performed to assess functional connectivity (FC) in the following networks: default mode, frontoparietal, limbic, visual, and sensorimotor. Patients were stratified into late-onset (pLOAD) and early-onset (pEOAD) prodromal AD according to the AAO and controls were stratified into younger and older groups accordingly. Decreased FC within the default mode and the limbic networks was observed in pLOAD, while pEOAD showed lower FC in the frontoparietal and visual networks. The sensorimotor network did not show differences between groups. A significant association was found between memory and limbic network FC in pLOAD, and between executive functions and frontoparietal network FC in pEOAD, although the latter association did not survive multiple comparison correction. Our findings indicate that aberrant connectivity in memory networks is associated with pLOAD, while networks underlying executive and visuo-spatial functions are affected in pEOAD.

Although being highly accurate, deep CNN models lack transparency and interpretability, precluding adequate clinical reasoning and not complying with most current regulatory demands. One popular choice for explaining deep image models is occluding regions of the image to isolate their influence on the prediction. However, existing methods for occluding patches of brain scans generate images outside the distribution to which the model was trained for, thus leading to unreliable explanations. In this paper, we propose an alternative explanation method that is specifically designed for the brain scan task. Our method, which we refer to as Swap Test, produces heatmaps that depict the areas of the brain that are most indicative of AD, providing interpretability for the model's decisions in a format understandable to clinicians. Experimental results using an axiomatic evaluation show that the proposed method is more suitable for explaining the diagnosis of AD using MRI while the opposite trend was observed when using a typical occlusion test. Therefore, we believe our method may address the inherent black-box nature of deep neural networks that are capable of diagnosing AD.;2161-4393;;978-1-7281-6926-2;;2020;;;S

This study is geared towards understanding the performance differences between these architectures. We used transfer and non-transfer learning approaches to study the underlying disease phenomenon. In our experiments on three class classification of early stages of AD, we found the performance of 3D architectures to be better in comparison to their 2D counterparts.

It has already been known that AD cannot be cured and treatment can only delay its progression. Therefore, it is very important to detect AD in early stage and prevent it to be worse. Furthermore, sooner the progression is detected, better the prognosis will be. In this research, we developed a novel multi-modal deep learning method to predict conversion from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is the stage between cognitively normal older people and AD. In our method, the multi-modal input data are defined as structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images and clinical data including several cognitive scores, APOE genotype, gender and age obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). Our criteria of selecting these input data are that they are mostly obtained by non-invasive examination. The proposed method integrates features obtained from MRI images and clinical data effectively by using bi-linear fusion. Bi-linear fusion computes the products of all elements between image and clinical features, where the correlation between them are included. That led to a big improvement of prediction accuracy in the experiment. The prediction model using bi-linear fusion achieved to predict conversion in one year with 0.86 accuracy, comparing with 0.76 accuracy using linear fusion.

MR images of 10 healthy subjects (75.5 +/- 8.0 years) were retrospectively selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI). The benchmark of choroid plexus segmentation was provided by the FreeSurfer package and manual correction. A 3D U-Net was developed and optimized in the patch extraction, augmentation, and loss function. In leave-one-out cross-validations, the optimized U-Net provided superior performance compared to the FreeSurfer results (Dice score 0.732 +/- 0.046 vs 0.581 +/- 0.093, Jaccard coefficient 0.579 +/- 0.057 vs 0.416 +/- 0.091, 95% Hausdorff distance 1.871 +/- 0.549 vs 7.257 +/- 5.038, and sensitivity 0.761 +/- 0.078 vs 0.539 +/- 0.117).;1945-7928;;978-1-5386-9330-8;;2020;;;S

Convolutional neural network (CNN) has been successfully used to achieve good performance in accurate diagnosis of AD. However, most existing methods utilized shallow CNN structures due to the small amount of sMRI data, which limits the ability of CNN to learn high-level features. Thus, in this paper, we propose a novel unified CNN framework for AD identification, where both 3D CNN and 3D convolutional long short-term memory (3D CLSTM) are employed. Specifically, we firstly exploit a 6-layer 3D CNN to learn informative features, then 3D CLSTM is leveraged to further extract the channel-wise higher-level information. Extensive experimental results on ADNI dataset show that our model has achieved an accuracy of 94.19% for AD detection, which outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and indicates the high effectiveness of our proposed method.;1945-7928;;978-1-5386-9330-8;;2020;;;S

Neuroimaging data is an integral part of the clinical assessment providing a way for clinicians to detect brain abnormalities for AD diagnosis. Anatomical MRI has been widely used to assess structural brain atrophy for AD detection and prediction.

This is important because at the cellular level the disease always starts. Computed Tomography scans and Magnetic Resonance Images are not able to reveal cell-level problems. So, Positron Emission Tomography scans can detect changes in the cells very early, but the others detect changes as a disease affects the organs or tissue structure. Since it rises, Positron Emission Tomography gained a serious role in the diagnosis and treatment of brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's and Dementia, in addition to tumors. Because of the high level of chemical activity that exists in abnormal tissues such as cancer cells, these cells will show up as bright spots on these scans. This can play a major role in the diagnostic process if modern image processing methods are used to identify bright areas, as it will assist specialists in the diagnostic process and monitor the pathological condition during the treatment period.

Here in this scope, solution anticipated to the inter-related disease with Picks Syndrome (PD) and Alzheimers Disease Syndrome (AD). The image data sets implied her are the functional Magnetic Resonance Images. The images become very contrasting based on many parameters - capturing intensity, noise content, geographical locations, Image acquisition based on the different corporate machines, capability of the Radiologist, the moment during the motion capturing, patient nature, etc., and hence many more features that comes into the account. Ultimately this effects the intensity and the noise level imposed during the motion capturing. A Daubechies Wavelet Transform is implied here. Its properties are: 1) Smoothening filters 2) extraction of frequency (feature) components 3) Median filter - removing the random noises better. A fourth level of extraction of features using the Wavelet Decomposition by Daubechies type was implied for formation of the feature vectors. From the sub-band regions of H-H level order with fourth level of decomposition level which will have high resolution was chosen for this act. Other have low-high combinatory, and fourth band has low - low combination which are very difficult to pick up the resolution points. This obtained features were implied for feature vector formation. The extraction of the features was obtained from the approximated co-efficients got from the Approximated sub-band levels thus chosen to form the input images and extracted co-efficients were fed to design, train and test the network for convergence, network framing and efficiency estimation respectively. A Self Organizing Map technique was chosen for designing up of the network using the Competitive Neural Network. This was used to classify the normal and Dementia based image types into its corresponding types.

Purpose: To compare automatic methods to segment white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in the elderly in order to assist radiologist and researchers in selecting the most relevant method for application on clinical or research data. Material and Methods: We studied a research dataset composed of 147 patients, including 97 patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) 2 database and 50 patients from ADNI 3 and a clinical routine dataset comprising 60 patients referred for cognitive impairment at the Pitie-Salpetriere hospital (imaged using four different MRI machines). We used manual segmentation as the gold standard reference. Both manual and automatic segmentations were performed using FLAIR MRI. We compared seven freely available methods that produce segmentation mask and are usable by a radiologist without a strong knowledge of com- puter programming: LGA (Schmidt et al., 2012), LPA (Schmidt. 2017), BIANCA (Griffanti et al., 2016), UBO detector (Jiang et al., 2018), W2MHS (Ithapu et al., 2014), nicMSlesion (with and without retraining) (Valverde et al., 2019, 2017).

Studies on MRI-based brain segmentation have received significant attention in recent years based on the non-invasive imaging and good soft-tissue contrast provided by MRI. A number of studies have used conventional machine learning strategies, as well as convolutional neural network approaches. In this paper, we propose a patch-wise M-net architecture for the automatic segmentation of brain MRI images. In the proposed brain segmentation method, slices from a brain MRI scan are divided into non-overlapping patches, which are then fed into an M-net model with corresponding ground-truth patches to train the network, which is composed of two encoder-decoder processes. Dilated convolutional kernels with different sizes are used in the encoder and decoder modules to derive abundant semantic features from brain MRI scans. The proposed patch-wise M-net overcomes the drawbacks of conventional methods and provides greater retention of fine details. The proposed M-net model was trained and tested on the open-access series of imaging studies dataset. The performance was measured quantitatively using the Dice similarity coefficient. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves average segmentation accuracies of 94.81% for CSF, 95.44% for GM, and 96.33% for WM, meaning it outperforms state-of-the-art methods.;2169-3536;;;;2020;8;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3006317;J

Furthermore, the proposed approach is computationally efficient and requires less than 2 seconds to calculate the number of voxels for an MRI scan. Moreover, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art deep learning approach, such as 2-D U-Net and SegNet in the context of voxel/volume estimation errors% for the left and right hippocampi.";2169-3536;;;;2020;8;10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2994388;J

However, its manual setting of parameters and inability to process multiple images affect the fusion performance. In this letter, a novel weighted parameter adaptive dual channel PCNN (WPADCPCNN) based medical fusion method is proposed in non-subsampled shearlet transform domain to fuse the magnetic resonance imaging and single-photon emission computed tomography images of AIDS dementia complex and Alzheimer's disease patients. The parameters of the proposed WPADCPCNN model are estimated from its inputs using fractal dimension. The high-pass sub-bands are fused using the WPADCPCNN model whereas the low-pass sub-bands are merged using a new weighted multi-scale morphological gradients based rule.

However, despite extensive study over the past 15 years, the development of rs-fcMRI as a biomarker has been impeded by a lack of reliable longitudinal rs-fcMRI measures. Here we focus on longitudinal change along the Alzheimer's disease (AD) trajectory and demonstrate the utility of Template Based Rotation (TBR) in detecting differential longitudinal rs-fcMRI change between higher and lower amyloid burden individuals with mildly impaired cognition. Specifically, we examine a small (N = 24), but densely sampled (similar to 5 observations over similar to 3 years), cohort of symptomatic individuals with serial rs-fcMRI imaging and PiB-PET imaging for -amyloid pathology. We observed longitudinal decline of the Default Mode and Salience network axis (DMN/SAL) among impaired individuals with high amyloid burden. No other networks showed differential change in high vs. low amyloid individuals over time. The standardized effect size of AD related DMN/SAL change is comparable to the standardized effect size of amyloid-related change on the mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and hippocampal volume (HV). Last, we show that the AD-related change in DMN/SAL connectivity is almost completely independent of change on MMSE or HV, suggesting that rsfcMRI is sensitive to an aspect of AD progression that is not captured by these other measures. Together these analyses demonstrate that longitudinal rs-fcMRI using TBR can capture disease-relevant network disruption in a clinical population.;2213-1582;;;;2020;26;10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102052;J

Precise three-dimensional (3D) segmentation of the hippocampus from magnetic resonance imaging scans is of great importance in the diagnosis of neurological diseases.

Although many recent studies have used computers to diagnose AD, most machine detection methods are limited by congenital observations. AD can be diagnosed-but not predicted-at its early stages, as prediction is only applicable before the disease manifests itself.

Brain hubs are brain regions that have a large number of both within and between module connections. We argue that weak connections in brain functional networks lead to misclassification of brain regions as hubs. In order to resolve this, we propose a new measure called ambivert degree that considers the node's degree as well as connection weights in order to identify nodes with both high degree and high connection weights as hubs. Using resting-state functional MRI scans from the Human Connectome Project, we show that ambivert degree identifies brain hubs that are not only crucial but also invariable across subjects. We hypothesize that nodal measures based on ambivert degree can be effectively used to classify patients from healthy controls for diseases that are known to have widespread hub disruption. Using patient data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism Spectrum Disorder, we show that the hubs in the patient and healthy groups are very different for both the diseases and deep feedforward neural networks trained on nodal hub features lead to a significantly higher classification accuracy with significantly fewer trainable weights compared to using functional connectivity features. Thus, the ambivert degree improves identification of crucial brain hubs in healthy subjects and can be used as a diagnostic feature to detect neurological diseases characterized by hub disruption.;2213-1582;;;;2020;25;10.1016/j.nicl.2020.102186;J

Computer-assisted diagnosis of AD based on image analysis is an emerging tool to support AD diagnosis. In this article, we explore the application of Supervised Switching Autoencoders (SSAs) to perform AD classification using only one structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (sMRI) slice. SSAs are revised supervised autoencoder architectures, combining unsupervised representation and supervised classification as one unified model. In this work, we study the capabilities of SSAs to capture complex visual neurodegeneration patterns, and fuse disease semantics simultaneously. We also examine how regions associated to disease state can be discovered by SSAs following a local patch-based approach. Methods: Patch-based SSAs models are trained on individual patches extracted from a single 2D slice, independently for Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes of the brain at selected informative locations, exploring different patch sizes and network parameterizations. Then, models perform binary class prediction - healthy (CDR = 0) or AD-demented (CDR > 0) - on test data at patch level. The final subject classification is performed employing a majority rule from the ensemble of patch predictions. In addition, relevant regions are identified, by computing accuracy densities from patch-level predictions, and analyzed, supported by Atlas-based regional definitions. Results: Our experiments employing a single 2D T1-w sMRI slice per subject show that SSAs perform similarly to previous proposals that rely on full volumetric information and feature-engineered representations. SSAs classification accuracy on slices extracted along the Axial, Coronal, and Sagittal anatomical planes from a balanced cohort of 40 independent test subjects was 87.5%, 90.0%, and 90.0%, respectively. A top sensitivity of 95.0% on both Coronal and Sagittal planes was also obtained. Conclusions: SSAs provided well-ranked accuracy performance among previous classification proposals, including feature-engineered and feature learning based methods, using only one scan slice per subject, instead of the whole 3D volume, as it is conventionally done. In addition, regions identified as relevant by SSAs' were, in most part, coherent or partially coherent in regard to relevant regions reported on previous works. These regions were also associated with findings from medical knowledge, which gives value to our methodology as a potential analytical aid for disease understanding.;0010-4825;1879-0534;;JAN;2020;116;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.103527;J

Using resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) scans of 331 participants, we obtained functional 3-dimensional (3-D) independent component spatial maps for use as features in classification and regression tasks. A 3-D convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture was developed for the classification task. MMSE scores were predicted using: linear least square regression (LLSR), support vector regression, bagging-based ensemble regression, and tree regression with group independent component analysis (gICA) features. To improve MMSE regression performance, we applied feature optimization methods including least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and support vector machine-based recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE). The mean balanced test accuracy was 85.27% for the classification of AD versus healthy controls. The medial visual, default mode, dorsal attention, executive, and auditory related networks were mainly associated with AD. The maximum clinical MMSE score prediction accuracy with the LLSR method applied on gICA combined with SVM-RFE features had the lowest root mean square error (3.27 +/- 0.58) and the highest R-2 value (0.63 +/- 0.02). Classification of AD and healthy controls can be successfully achieved using only rs-fMRI and MMSE scores can be accurately predicted using functional independent component features.

Alzheimer's disease is defined as the most common cause of dementia and changes different parts of the brain. Neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid, and some protein abnormalities are commonly used as clinical diagnostic biomarkers. In this study, neuroimaging biomarkers were applied for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and dementia as a noninvasive method. Structural magnetic resonance (MR) brain images were used as input of the predictive model. T1 weighted volumetric MR images were reduced to two-dimensional space by several preprocessing methods for three different projections. Convolutional neural network (CNN) models took preprocessed brain images, and the training and testing of the CNN models were carried out with two different data sets. The CNN models achieved accuracy values around 0.8 for diagnosis of both Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. The experimental results revealed that the diagnosis of patients with mild cognitive impairment was more difficult than that of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The proposed deep learning-based model might serve as an efficient and practical diagnostic tool when MRI data are integrated with other clinical tests.;1300-0632;1303-6203;;;2020;28;10.3906/elk-1904-172;J

We aim at finding links between cognitive symptoms and the underlying neurodegeneration process by fusing the information of neuropsychological test outcomes, diagnoses, and other clinical data with the imaging features extracted solely via a data-driven decomposition of MRI. The distribution of the extracted features in different combinations is then analyzed and visualized using regression and classification analysis, and the influence of each coordinate of the autoencoder manifold over the brain is estimated. The imaging-derived markers could then predict clinical variables with correlations above 0.6 in the case of neuropsychological evaluation variables such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores, achieving a classification accuracy over 80 for the diagnosis of AD.;2168-2194;2168-2208;;JAN;2020;24;10.1109/JBHI.2019.2914970;J

The development of an automation process will help in identifying the Alzheimer disease (AD). The maximum distinctive AD related to neuronal loss in the brain sub regions is GM, WM, CC and HC. Several nature optimization algorithms are being developed to get an optimum solution for segmenting these kinds of very hectic regions. In this work, brain sub regions have been considered to diagnose the AD using four various optimization algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimization (GWO) and Cuckoo Search (CS). Among these optimization techniques, GWO shows promising results due to the proper selection of global optimum solution. The segmented regions have been classified using deep learning classifier and it has been validated with Ground Truth (GT) images. The results prove that GWO is capable to segment the brain sub regions with high accuracy of 98% similarity among the ground truth and segmented region. Then, the segmented regions are classified using deep learning classifier and the results show the high accuracy of 95%. From the above sub regions, HC proves better classification accuracy of 95%, sensitivity as 95% and specificity as 94% compared to all other regions. Based on the output of segmentation and classification measures it is clearly observed that, the proposed method provide better performance than other methods. Finally, the normal and AD subjects are also validated clinically with mini mental state examination (MMSE) score. From this evaluation it is observed that, the proposed work is highly correlated with MMSE score. Therefore, the proposed pipeline witnessed that the HC region is the major factor for diagnosing AD.

This study proposes an improved end-to-end dual-functional 3D convolutional neural network for segmenting bilateral hippocampi from 3D brain MRI scans and diagnosing AD progression states simultaneously. Methods The proposed neural network is based on the V-Net and adopts an end-to-end structure. In order to relieve the excessive amount of convolutional parameters at the bottom of the V-Net, we change them to bottleneck architecture. Based on the segmentation network, we establish a classification network for diagnosing pathological states of brain. In order to balance the two tasks of hippocampi segmentation and brain pathological states diagnosis, we designed a unique loss function. This study included 132 samples, of which 100 were selected as training, and the remaining 32 were used to test the performance of our model. During training, we adopted fivefold cross-validation method. Results We selected the intersection over union and dice coefficient to evaluate the hippocampus segmentation performance, while the brain pathological states diagnosis performance was evaluated by accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, precision and F1 score.

Although, research on AD has increased in recent years, however, the complexity associated with brain structure and functions makes the early diagnosis of this disease a challenging task. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is a neuroimaging technology that has been widely used to study the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. In literature, the computer-aided diagnosis of AD is limited to binary classification or diagnosis of AD and MCI stages. However, its applicability to diagnose multiple progressive stages of AD is relatively under-studied. This study explores the effectiveness of rs-fMRI for multi-class classification of AD and its associated stages including CN, SMC, EMCI, MCI, LMCI, and AD. A longitudinal cohort of resting-state fMRI of 138 subjects (25 CN, 25 SMC, 25 EMCI, 25 LMCI, 13 MCI, and 25 AD) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is studied. To provide a better insight into deep learning approaches and their applications to AD classification, we investigate ResNet-18 architecture in detail. We consider the training of the network from scratch by using single-channel input as well as performed transfer learning with and without fine-tuning using an extended network architecture. We experimented with residual neural networks to perform AD classification task and compared it with former research in this domain. The performance of the models is evaluated using precision, recall, f1-measure, AUC and ROC curves. We found that our networks were able to significantly classify the subjects. We achieved improved results with our fine-tuned model for all the AD stages with an accuracy of 100%, 96.85%, 97.38%, 97.43%, 97.40% and 98.01% for CN, SMC, EMCI, LMCI, MCI, and AD respectively.

The extent to which diminished microstructure precedes or results from macrostructural white matter damage is poorly understood. This study evaluated the hypothesis that white matter areas with normatively lower microstructure in young adults are most susceptible to develop WMH in older adults. Forty-nine younger participants (age = 25.8 +/- 2.8 years) underwent diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and 557 older participants (age = 73.9 +/- 5.7 years) underwent DWI and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In older adults, WMH had a mostly periventricular distribution with higher frequency in frontal regions. We found lower FA in areas of frank WMH compared to normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) in older adults. Then, to determine if areas of normatively lower white matter microstructure spatially overlap with areas that frequently develop macrostructural damage in older age, we created a WMH frequency map in which each voxel represented the percentage of older adults with a WMH in that voxel. We found lower normative FA in young adults with regions frequently segmented as WMH in older adults. We conclude that low white matter microstructure is observed in areas of white matter macrostructural damage, but white matter microstructure is also normatively low (i.e., at ages 20-30) in regions with high WMH frequency, prior to white matter macrostructural damage.;1663-4365;;;DEC 10;2019;11;10.3389/fnagi.2019.00345;J

However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the presence, as well as the evolution, of altered awareness of memory function across the preclinical and prodromal stages of AD. Here, we aimed to characterize change in awareness of memory abilities and its relationship to beta-amyloid (A beta) burden in a large cohort (N = 1,070) of individuals across the disease spectrum. Methods Memory awareness was longitudinally assessed (average number of visits = 4.3) and operationalized using the discrepancy between mean participant and partner report on the Everyday Cognition scale (memory domain). A beta deposition was measured at baseline using [18F]florbetapir positron emission tomographic imaging. Results A beta predicted longitudinal changes in memory awareness, such that awareness decreased faster in participants with increased A beta burden. A beta and clinical group interacted to predict change in memory awareness, demonstrating the strongest effect in dementia participants, but could also be found in the cognitively normal (CN) participants. In a subset of CN participants who progressed to mild cognitive impairment (MCI), heightened memory awareness was observed up to 1.6 years before MCI diagnosis, with memory awareness declining until the time of progression to MCI (-0.08 discrepant-points/yr). In a subset of MCI participants who progressed to dementia, awareness was low initially and continued to decline (-0.23 discrepant-points/yr), reaching anosognosia 3.2 years before dementia onset. Interpretation A beta burden is associated with a progressive decrease in self-awareness of memory deficits, reaching anosognosia approximately 3 years before dementia diagnosis.

However, end-to-end learning that is capable of maximizing the impact of deep learning has yet to receive much attention due to the endemic challenge of neuroimaging caused by the scarcity of data. Thus, this study presents an approach meant to encourage the end-to-end learning of a volumetric convolutional neural network (CNN) model for four binary classification tasks (AD vs. normal control (NC), progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI) vs. NC, stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) vs. NC and pMCI vs. sMCI) based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and visualizes its outcomes in terms of the decision of the CNNs without any human intervention. In the proposed approach, we use convolutional autoencoder (CAE)-based unsupervised learning for the AD vs. NC classification task, and supervised transfer learning is applied to solve the pMCI vs. sMCI classification task. To detect the most important biomarkers related to AD and pMCI, a gradient-based visualization method that approximates the spatial influence of the CNN model's decision was applied. To validate the contributions of this study, we conducted experiments on the ADNI database, and the results demonstrated that the proposed approach achieved the accuracies of 86.60% and 73.95% for the AD and pMCI classification tasks respectively, outperforming other network models. In the visualization results, the temporal and parietal lobes were identified as key regions for classification.;2045-2322;;;DEC 3;2019;9;10.1038/s41598-019-54548-6;J

This study proposed a three-dimensional (3D) deep learning architecture based on a fully convolutional network (FCN) to synthesize diffusion-tensor imaging (DTI) from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: fMRI signals derived from white matter (WM) exist and can be used for assessing WM alterations. We constructed an initial functional correlation tensor image using the correlation patterns of adjacent fMRI voxels as one input to the FCN. We considered T1-weighted images as an additional input to provide an algorithm with the structural information needed to synthesize DTI. Our architecture was trained and tested using a large-scale open database dataset (training n = 648; testing n = 293). Results: The average correlation value between synthesized and actual diffusion tensors for 38 WM regions was 0.808, which significantly improves upon an existing study (r = 0.480). We also validated our approach using two open databases. Our proposed method showed a higher correlation with the actual diffusion tensor than the conventional machine-learning method for many WM regions. Conclusions: Our method synthesized DTI images from fMRI images using a 3D FCN architecture.

While contemporary models consider hoarding and obsessive-compulsive disorder distinct, the related behaviours have not been separately examined in patients with FTD, and the neuroanatomical correlates of hoarding in patients with FTD have not been previously examined (American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Grisham and Baldwin, 2015; Mataix-Cols et al., 2010). Methods: Patients with FTD who were evaluated between 2004 and 2018 at our centre were included. Cortical thickness and subcortical volumetric analyses were completed on available T1 high resolution anatomic scans using FreeSurfer. Results: Eighty-seven patients met inclusion criteria, and 49 had scans available for quantitative MRI volumetric analysis. New hoarding behaviours were present in 29% of patients and were more common in the semantic variant subtype of FTD, while 49% of individuals had new or increased OCB. Hoarding behaviours were associated with decreased thickness in a factor comprised of left temporal, insular and anterior cingulate cortices. The presence of OCB was predicted by reduced cortical thickness and volumes in a factor comprised of the anterior cingulate and subcortical volumes in the bilateral amygdala and hippocampus. OCB were associated with greater right temporal cortical thickness in comparison to patients with hoarding. Discussion: The association of the semantic variant with hoarding, together with the observed associations between left temporal atrophy and hoarding indicate that degeneration of the left temporal lobe has a role in the emergence of hoarding in FTD. As in current models of Hoarding disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder, our results suggest that in patients with FTD, hoarding and OCB are clinically and anatomically partially dissociable phenomenon. The results may also help to further elucidate the cognitive processes and neural networks contributing to Hoarding disorder and Obsessive-Compulsive disorder in persons without dementia.

Animal models and in vitro experiments have provided evidence for a cell-autonomous and a non-cell-autonomous mechanism for the accumulation of neuropathology. Combining modern neuroimaging tools to identify distinct neural networks (connectomics) with target-specific positron emission tomography (PET) tracers is an emerging and vibrant field of research with the potential to examine the contributions of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms to the spread of pathology. The evidence provided here suggests that both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous processes relate to the observed in vivo characteristics of protein pathology and neurodegeneration across the disease spectrum. We propose a synergistic model of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous accounts that integrates the most critical factors (i.e., protein strain, susceptible cell feature and connectome) contributing to the development of neuronal dysfunction and in turn produces the observed clinical phenotypes. We believe that a timely and longitudinal pursuit of such research programs will greatly advance our understanding of the complex mechanisms driving human neurodegenerative diseases.;1619-7070;1619-7089;;DEC;2019;46;10.1007/s00259-019-04394-5;J

However, little is known on predictive value of topological properties of widely distributed neural networks immediately following stroke on rehabilitation outcome and post-stroke recovery measured by early functional outcome. The utility of EEG network parameters (i.e. small world organization) analysis as a potential rough and simple biomarker for stroke outcome has been little explored and needs more validation. A total of 139 consecutive patients within a post-stroke acute stage underwent EEG recording. A group of 110 age paired healthy subjects constituted the control group. All patients were clinically evaluated with 3 scales for stroke: NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT. As a first result, NIHSS, Barthel and ARAT correlated with Small World index as provided by the proportional increment/decrement of low (delta) and vice-versa of high (beta2 and gamma) EEG frequency bands. Furthermore, in line with the aim of the present study, we found a strong correlation between NIHSS at follow up and gamma Small World index in the acute poststroke period, giving SW index a significant weight of recovery prediction. This study aimed to investigate possible correlations between functional abnormalities of brain networks, measured by small world characteristics detected in resting state EEG source investigation, and early post-stroke clinical outcome in order to find a possible predictive index of functional recovery to address and/or correct the rehabilitation program.;0167-8760;1872-7697;;DEC;2019;146;10.1016/j.ijpsycho.2019.09.012;J

In this study, a deep learning framework utilizing Siamese neural networks trained on paired lateral inter-hemispheric regions is used to harness the discriminative power of whole-brain volumetric asymmetry. The method uses the MRICloud pipeline to yield low-dimensional volumetric features of pre-defined atlas brain structures, and a novel non-linear kernel trick to normalize these features to reduce batch effects across datasets and populations. By working with the low-dimensional features, Siamese networks were shown to yield comparable performance to studies that utilize whole-brain MR images, with the advantage of reduced complexity and computational time, while preserving the biological information density. Experimental results also show that Siamese networks perform better in certain metrics by explicitly encoding the asymmetry in brain volumes, compared to traditional prediction methods that do not use the asymmetry, on the ADNI and BIOCARD datasets.;0730-725X;1873-5894;;DEC;2019;64;10.1016/j.mri.2019.07.003;J

However, targeting the aging mechanism may improve outcomes and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) system alteration could have implications for treatment of cognitive decline in old age. We studied the effects of the GABA system on brain activity in aged APP and PS1 transgenic mice. Low dose (0.1 mg/kg i.p.) GABA(A) agonist muscimol and antagonist bicuculline were administered for moderate system activation and inhibition, respectively. EEGs from the hippocampus (Hip) and prefrontal cortex (PFC) were recorded under spontaneous state and during Y-maze performance. Basally, AD mice exhibited increased spontaneous EEG delta (2-4 Hz) and decreased spontaneous EEG alpha (8-12 Hz) activity in the Hip, and decreased Y-maze EEG theta (4-8 Hz) activity in the PFC. Interestingly, GABA(A) activation and inhibition in AD mice reduced EEG delta activity and increased EEG theta activity in the PFC, and behaviorally improved spatial recognition memory during Y-maze testing. Decreased spontaneous EEG delta activity was also observed in the PFC. Specifically, GABA(A) activation primarily affected low frequency EEG (2-12 Hz) activity in the PFC, whereas inhibition affected EEG activity across many frequencies in the PFC and Hip. These data provide evidence for slower brain activity in AD mice. Importantly, improved spatial memory after GABA(A) activation and inhibition may be explained by brain rhythm recovery in certain regions.

In this paper, a novel machine learning based diagnosis and monitoring of AD-like diseases is proposed. The AD-like diseases diagnosis process is accomplished by analysing the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans using deep learning and is followed by an activity monitoring framework to monitor the subjects' activities of daily living using body worn inertial sensors. The activity monitoring provides an assistive framework in daily life activities and evaluates vulnerability of the patients based on the activity level. The AD diagnosis results show up to 82% improvement in comparison to well-known existing techniques. Moreover, above 95% accuracy is achieved to classify the activities of daily living which is quite encouraging in terms of monitoring the activity profile of the subject. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Analysis on functional brain networks provides powerful abilities to discover potential mechanisms of human brain, and to aid brain disease detection, such as AD (Alzheimer's disease). Effective discrimination of patients of AD and MCI (mild cognitive impairment) from NC (normal control) is important for the early diagnosis of AD. Therefore, this paper explores the problem of brain network classification for AD detection. Two deep learning methods of functional brain network classification are designed. The convolutional learning method learns the deep regional-connectivity features, while the recurrent learning method learns the deep adjacent positional features. The ELM (extreme learning machine)-boosted structure is also implemented to further improve the learning ability. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the AUC (area under curve), accuracy, recall, and training time of the proposed methods on a real-world dataset. Results indicate that (1) the proposed methods which learn deep features directly from brain networks outperform shallow learning methods and (2) models with the ELM-boosted structure achieve a higher performance. This paper explores the brain networks learning with deep features and ELM.

Methods Participants comprised the cardiovascular cohort of the Swedish prospective population-based Malmo Diet and Cancer Study (N = 6,103). Carotid plaques and intima media thickness (IMT) were measured at baseline (1991-1994). Dementia incidence until 2014 was obtained from national registers. Diagnoses were reviewed and validated in medical records. In a cognitively unimpaired subcohort (n = 330), beta-amyloid(42) and tau were quantified in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and white matter hyperintensity volume, lacunar infarcts, and cerebral microbleeds were estimated on magnetic resonance imaging (2009-2015). Results During 20 years of follow-up, 462 individuals developed dementia (mean age at baseline = 57.5 +/- 5.9 years, 58% women). Higher IMT in midlife was associated with an increased hazard ratio (HR) of all-cause dementia (adjusted HR = 1.14 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.03-1.26]) and vascular dementia (adjusted HR = 1.32 [95% CI = 1.10-1.57]) but not Alzheimer disease (AD) dementia (adjusted HR = 0.95 [95% CI = 0.77-1.17]). Carotid plaques were associated with vascular dementia when assessed as a 3-graded score (adjusted HR = 1.90 [95% CI = 1.07-3.38]). In the cognitively unimpaired subcohort (53.8 +/- 4.6 years at baseline, 60% women), higher IMT in midlife was associated with development of small vessel disease (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 1.47 [95% CI = 1.05-2.06]) but not significantly with abnormal CSF AD biomarkers (adjusted OR = 1.28 [95% CI = 0.87-1.90] for A beta(42) and 1.35 [95% CI = 0.86-2.13] for A beta(42)/p-tau). Carotid plaques revealed no significant association with any of the underlying brain pathologies. Interpretation Our findings support an association between midlife atherosclerosis and development of vascular dementia and cerebral small vessel disease but not between atherosclerosis and subsequent AD dementia or AD pathology.

Deep learning with brain imaging is the imaging method of choice for the diagnosis and prediction of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is also well known that DCNNs are black boxes owing to their low interpretability to humans.

To overcome this limitation, we develop a novel general framework that integrates deep leaning, feature selection, causal inference, and genetic-imaging data analysis for predicting and understanding AD. The proposed algorithm not only improves the prediction accuracy but also identifies the brain regions underlying the development of AD and causal paths from genetic variants to AD via image mediation. The proposed algorithm is applied to the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 151 subjects (51 AD and 100 non-AD) who were measured at four time points of baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months.

Specifically, we parcellate the brain into predefined regions based on anatomical knowledge (i.e., templates) and derive complex nonlinear relationships among voxels, whose intensities denote volumetric measurements, within each region. Unlike existing methods that use cubical or rectangular shapes, we consider the anatomical shapes of regions as atypical patches. Using complex nonlinear relationships among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a regional abnormality representation. We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over the entire brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing these observations in the brain space.

Optimal integration of data from different MRI modalities is an active area of research aimed at increasing diagnostic accuracy. Based on a sample of 96 patients with schizophrenia and a matched sample of 115 healthy controls that had undergone a single multimodal MRI session, we generated individual brain maps of gray matter vbm, 1back, and 2back levels of activation (nback fMRI), maps of amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (resting-state fMRI), and maps of weighted global brain connectivity (resting-state fMRI). Four unimodal classifiers (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forests, and Gradient boosting) were applied to these maps to evaluate their classification accuracies. Based on the assignments made by the algorithms on test individuals, we quantified the amount of predictive information shared between maps (what we call redundancy analysis). Finally, we explored the added accuracy provided by a set of multimodal strategies that included post-classification integration based on probabilities, two-step sequential integration, and voxel-level multimodal integration through one-dimensional-convolutional neural networks (1D-CNNs). All four unimodal classifiers showed the highest test accuracies with the 2back maps (80% on average) achieving a maximum of 84% with the Lasso. Redundancy levels between brain maps were generally low (overall mean redundancy score of 0.14 in a 0-1 range), indicating that each brain map contained differential predictive information. The highest multimodal accuracy was delivered by the two-step Ridge classifier (87%) followed by the Ridge maximum and mean probability classifiers (both with 85% accuracy) and by the 1D-CNN, which achieved the same accuracy as the best unimodal classifier (84%). From these results, we conclude that from all MRI modalities evaluated task-based fMRI may be the best unimodal diagnostic option in schizophrenia. Low redundancy values point to ample potential for accuracy improvements through multimodal integration, with the two-step Ridge emerging as a suitable strategy.;;1662-453X;;NOV 7;2019;13;10.3389/fnins.2019.01203;J

Behavioral evidence has indicated an alteration of motor imagery in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). However, it still remains unclear on the altered neurophysiological processing mechanism of motor imagery and whether this mechanism links the abnormal biological basis of motor imagery with impaired cognition in aMCI. This study was to investigate the altered neurophysiological processing mechanism of motor imagery and to examine the relationships between this knowledge and the altered structural basis of motor imagery with impaired cognition in aMCI. A hand mental rotation paradigm was used to manipulate the processing of motor imagery while event-related brain potentials (ERPs) were recorded and gray matter (GM) voxel-based morphometry was performed in 20 aMCI and 29 healthy controls. Compared with controls, aMCI exhibited lower ERP amplitudes in parietal cortex and higher ERP amplitudes in frontal cortex during motor imagery. In addition, aMCI showed reduced GM volumes in cerebellum posterior lobe, insula and hippocampus/parahippocampal gyrus, and increased GM volumes in middle cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus. Most importantly, increased ERP amplitude significantly mediated the association between increased GM and cognition. This study provided a novel evidence for the relationships between the electrophysiological processing mechanism and structural basis of motor imagery with impaired cognition in aMCI. It suggests that improving neural activity by stimulating the frontal lobe can potentially contribute to acquire motor imagery skills for neurological rehabilitation in aMCI subjects.;0896-0267;1573-6792;;MAR;2020;33;10.1007/s10548-019-00742-8;J

Previous findings suggest that the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and its variants (i.e., frontal and temporo-limbic) may be related to the vulnerability of distinct functional connectivity networks. In this study, 82 bvFTD patients were included, and two patient groups were identified as frontal and temporo-limbic bvFTD variants. Two advanced multivariate analytical approaches were applied to FDG-PET data, i.e., sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE) method and seed-based interregional correlation analysis (IRCA). These advanced methods allowed the assessment of (i) the whole-brain metabolic connectivity, without any a priori assumption, and (ii) the main brain resting-state networks of crucial relevance for cognitive and behavioural functions. In the whole bvFTD group, we found dysfunctional connectivity patterns in frontal and limbic regions and in all major brain resting-state networks as compared to healthy controls (HC N = 82). In the two bvFTD variants, SICE and IRCA analyses identified variant-specific reconfigurations of whole-brain connectivity and resting-state networks. Specifically, the frontal bvFTD variant was characterised by metabolic connectivity alterations in orbitofrontal regions and anterior resting-state networks, while the temporo-limbic bvFTD variant was characterised by connectivity alterations in the limbic and salience networks. These results highlight different neural vulnerabilities in the two bvFTD variants, as shown by the dysfunctional connectivity patterns, with relevance for the different neuropsychological profiles. This new evidence provides further insight in the variability of bvFTD and may contribute to a more accurate classification of these patients. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The investigation of the microstructural change of white matter (WM) between T2DM with amnesic MCI (T2DM-aMCI) and T2DM with normal cognition (T2DM-NC) and their relationships to cognitive performances can help to understand the brain variations in T2DM-related amnesic cognitive impairment. In the current study, 36 T2DM-aMCI patients, 40 T2DM-NC patients, and 40 healthy control (HC) individuals underwent diffusion tensor image and T1-weighted MRI scans and comprehensive cognition assessments. All of these cognitive functions exhibited intergroup ranking differences in patients. The T2DM-NC patients and HC individuals did not reveal any significant differences in WM integrity. The T2DM-aMCI patients showed disrupted integrity in multiple WM tracts compared with HC and T2DM-NC. Specifically, the damaged WM integrity of the right inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus exhibited significant correlations with episodic memory and attention function impairment in T2DM patients. Furthermore, cognitive impairment-related WM microstructural damage was associated with the degeneration of cortex connected to the affected WM tract. These findings indicate that degeneration exists extensively in WM tracts in T2DM-aMCI, whereas no brain WM damage is evident in T2DM-NC.;0012-1797;1939-327X;;NOV;2019;68;10.2337/db19-0233;J
"Pagnozzi, AM; Fripp, J; Rose, SE";"Pagnozzi, Alex M.; Fripp, Jurgen; Rose, Stephen E.";Quantifying deep grey matter atrophy using automated segmentation approaches: A systematic review of structural MRI studies;NEUROIMAGE;The deep grey matter (DGM) nuclei of the brain play a crucial role in learning, behaviour, cognition, movement and memory. Although automated segmentation strategies can provide insight into the impact of multiple neurological conditions affecting these structures, such as Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Huntington's disease (HD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD) and Cerebral Palsy (CP), there are a number of technical challenges limiting an accurate automated segmentation of the DGM. Namely, the insufficient contrast of T1 sequences to completely identify the boundaries of these structures, as well as the presence of iso-intense white matter lesions or extensive tissue loss caused by brain injury. Therefore in this systematic review, 269 eligible studies were analysed and compared to determine the optimal approaches for addressing these technical challenges. The automated approaches used among the reviewed studies fall into three broad categories, atlas-based approaches focusing on the accurate alignment of atlas priors, algorithmic approaches which utilise intensity information to a greater extent, and learning-based approaches that require an annotated training set. Studies that utilise freely available software packages such as FIRST, FreeSurfer and LesionTOADS were also eligible, and their performance compared. Overall, deep learning approaches achieved the best overall performance, however these strategies are currently hampered by the lack of large-scale annotated data. Improving model generalisability to new datasets could be achieved in future studies with data augmentation and transfer learning. Multi-atlas approaches provided the second-best performance overall, and may be utilised to construct a silver standard annotated training set for deep learning. To address the technical challenges, providing robustness to injury can be improved by using multiple channels, highly elastic diffeomorphic transformations such as LDDMM, and by following atlas-based approaches with an intensity driven refinement of the segmentation, which has been done with the Expectation Maximisation (EM) and level sets methods. Accounting for potential lesions should be achieved with a separate lesion segmentation approach, as in LesionTOADS. Finally, to address the issue of limited contrast, R2*, T2* and QSM sequences could be used to better highlight the DGM due to its higher iron content. Future studies could look to additionally acquire these sequences by retaining the phase information from standard structural scans, or alternatively acquiring these sequences for only a training set, allowing models to learn the improved segmentation from T1-sequences alone.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;NOV 1;2019;201;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.116018;J

We previously reported a large-animal study of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in the fornix that found stimulation-induced hemodynamic responses in both the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits on functional resonance imaging (fMRI) and evoked dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), as measured by fast-scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The effects of DBS on the fornix are challenging to analyze, given its structural complexity and connection to multiple neuronal networks. In this study, we extend our earlier work to a rodent model wherein we characterize regional brain activity changes resulting from fornix stimulation using fludeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) micro positron emission tomography (PET) and monitor neurochemical changes using FSCV with pharmacological confirmation. Both global functional changes and local changes were measured in a rodent model of fornix DBS. Functional brain activity was measured by micro-PET, and the neurochemical changes in local areas were monitored by FSCV. Micro-PET images revealed increased glucose metabolism within the medial limbic and corticolimbic circuits. Neurotransmitter efflux induced by fornix DBS was monitored at NAc by FSCV and identified by specific neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors. We found a significant increase in the metabolic activity in several key regions of the medial limbic circuits and dopamine efflux in the NAc following fornix stimulation. These results suggest that electrical stimulation of the fornix modulates the activity of brain memory circuits, including the hippocampus and NAc within the dopaminergic pathway.;;1662-453X;;OCT 24;2019;13;10.3389/fnins.2019.01109;J

Methods We identified 1,230 elderly subjects (aged >= 50 years) with an average of 4.9 years of clinical follow-up and with amyloid positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging markers of amyloid and brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and cortical thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and early to midlife intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal cognitive trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling longitudinal cognitive decline. Results All the pathways (amyloid, vascular, resilience) converged through their effects on cortical thinning and worsening cognition and together explained patterns in cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging process, sex differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) had significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity. Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity through systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity contributed to significant cortical thinning and subsequently longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a significant proportion of cognitive decline that accelerated with longer follow-up times, and its primary impact was through cortical thinning. Interpretation We developed an integrated framework to help explain the dynamic and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal pathways. Such an approach is important for both better comprehension of cognitive aging processes and will aid in the development of successful intervention strategies.

It is extremely important to correctly identify patients during the MCI stage because this is the phase where AD may or may not develop. Thus, it is crucial to predict outcomes during this phase. Thus far, many researchers have worked on only using a single modality of a biomarker for the diagnosis of AD or MCI. Although recent studies show that a combination of one or more different biomarkers may provide complementary information for the diagnosis, it also increases the classification accuracy distinguishing between different groups. In this paper, we propose a novel machine learning-based framework to discriminate subjects with AD or MCI utilizing a combination of four different biomarkers: fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein levels, and Apolipoprotein-E (APOE) genotype. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) baseline dataset was used in this study. In total, there were 158 subjects for whom all four modalities of biomarker were available. Of the 158 subjects, 38 subjects were in the AD group, 82 subjects were in MCI groups (including 46 in MCIc [MCI converted; conversion to AD within 24 months of time period], and 36 in MCIs [MCI stable; no conversion to AD within 24 months of time period]), and the remaining 38 subjects were in the healthy control (HC) group. For each image, we extracted 246 regions of interest (as features) using the Brainnetome template image and NiftyReg toolbox, and later we combined these features with three CSF and two APOE genotype features obtained from the ADNI website for each subject using early fusion technique. Here, a different kernel-based multiclass support vector machine (SVM) classifier with a grid-search method was applied. Before passing the obtained features to the classifier, we have used truncated singular value decomposition (Truncated SVD) dimensionality reduction technique to reduce high dimensional features into a lower-dimensional feature. As a result, our combined method achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AU-ROC) curve of 98.33, 93.59, 96.83, 94.64, 96.43, and 95.24% for AD vs. HC, MCIs vs. MCIc, AD vs. MCIs, AD vs. MCIc, HC vs. MCIc, and HC vs. MCIs subjects which are high relative to single modality results and other state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, combined multimodal methods have improved the classification performance over the unimodal classification.";;1662-5188;;OCT 16;2019;13;10.3389/fncom.2019.00072;J

Here, we suggested a one-step quantification based on deep learning using native-space amyloid PET images of different radiotracers acquired from multiple centers. Methods Amyloid PET data of the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used for this study. A training/validation consists of 850 florbetapir PET images. Three hundred sixty-six florbetapir and 89 florbetaben PET images were used as test sets to evaluate the model. Native-space amyloid PET images were used as inputs, and the outputs were standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) calculated by the conventional MR-based method. Results The mean absolute errors (MAEs) of the composite SUVR were 0.040, 0.060, and 0.050 of training/validation and test sets for florbetapir PET and a test set for florbetaben PET, respectively. The agreement of amyloid positivity measured by Cohen's kappa for test sets of florbetapir and florbetaben PET were 0.87 and 0.89, respectively. Conclusion We suggest a one-step quantification method for amyloid PET via a deep learning model.

These methods emphasis only on using the individual feature from sMRI images for the classification of AD, MCI, and HC subjects and their achieved classification accuracy is low. However, latest multimodal studies have shown that combining multiple features from different sMRI analysis techniques can improve the classification accuracy for these types of subjects. In this paper, we propose a novel classification technique that precisely distinguishes individuals with AD, aAD (stable MCI, who had not converted to AD within a 36-month time period), and mAD (MCI caused by AD, who had converted to AD within a 36-month time period) from HC individuals. The proposed method combines three different features extracted from structural MR (sMR) images using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), hippocampal volume (HV), and cortical and subcortical segmented region techniques. Three classification experiments were performed (AD vs. HC, aAD vs. mAD, and HC vs. mAD) with 326 subjects (171 elderly controls and 81 AD, 35 aAD, and 39 mAD patients). For the development and validation of the proposed classification method, we acquired the sMR images from the dataset of the National Research Center for Dementia (NRCD). A five-fold crossvalidation technique was applied to find the optimal hyperparameters for the classifier, and the classification performance was compared by using three well-known classifiers: K-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and random forest. Overall, the proposed model with the SVM classifier achieved the best performance on the NRCD dataset. For the individual feature, the VBM technique provided the best results followed by the HV technique. However, the use of combined features improved the classification accuracy and predictive power for the early classification of AD compared to the use of individual features. The most stable and reliable classification results were achieved when combining all extracted features. Additionally, to analyze the efficiency of the proposed model, we used the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset to compare the classification performance of the proposed model with those of several state-of-the-art methods.;1932-6203;;;OCT 4;2019;14;10.1371/journal.pone.0222446;J

There is a long preclinical period followed by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Clinical diagnosis and the rate of decline is variable. Progression monitoring remains a challenge in AD, and it is imperative to create better tools to quantify this progression. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is commonly used for patient assessment. However, current approaches for analysis require strong a priori assumptions about regions of interest used and complex preprocessing pipelines including computationally expensive non-linear registrations and iterative surface deformations. These preprocessing steps are composed of many stacked processing layers. Any error or bias in an upstream layer will be propagated throughout the pipeline. Failures or biases in the non-linear subject registration and the subjective choice of atlases of specific regions are common in medical neuroimaging analysis and may hinder the translation of many approaches to the clinical practice. Here we propose a data-driven method based on an extension of a deep learning architecture, DeepSymNet, that identifies longitudinal changes without relying on prior brain regions of interest, an atlas, or non-linear registration steps. Our approach is trained end-to-end and learns how a patient's brain structure dynamically changes between two-time points directly from the raw voxels. We compare our approach with Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines and voxel-based methods using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Our model can identify AD progression with comparable results to existing Freesurfer longitudinal pipelines without the need of predefined regions of interest, non-rigid registration algorithms, or iterative surface deformation at a fraction of the processing time. When compared to other voxel-based methods which share some of the same benefits, our model showed a statistically significant performance improvement. Additionally, we show that our model can differentiate between healthy subjects and patients with MCI. The model's decision was investigated using the epsilon layer-wise propagation algorithm. We found that the predictions were driven by the pallidum, putamen, and the superior temporal gyrus. Our novel longitudinal based, deep learning approach has the potential to diagnose patients earlier and enable new computational tools to monitor neurodegeneration in clinical practice.;;1662-453X;;OCT 4;2019;13;10.3389/fnins.2019.01053;J

We investigated changes in functional and structural connectivity among regions that support memory function in prodromal Alzheimer's disease, i.e., during the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage. Methods Twenty-three older healthy controls and 25 adults with MCI underwent multimodal MRI scanning. Limbic white matter tracts the fornix, parahippocampal cingulum, retrosplenial cingulum, subgenual cingulum and uncinate fasciculus were reconstructed in ExploreDTl using constrained spherical deconvolution-based tractography. Using a network-of-interest approach, resting-state functional connectivity time-series correlations among sub-parcellations of the default mode and limbic networks, the hippocampus and the thalamus were calculated in Conn. Analysis Controlling for age, education, and gender between group linear regressions of five diffusion-weighted measures and of resting state connectivity measures were performed per hemisphere. FDR-corrections were performed within each class of measures. Correlations of within-network Fisher Z-transformed correlation coefficients and the mean diffusivity per tract were performed. Whole-brain graph theory measures of cluster coefficient and average path length were inspecting using the resting state data. Results & conclusion MCI-related changes in white matter structure were found in the fornix, left parahippocampal cingulum, left retrosplenial cingulum and left subgenual cingulum. Functional connectivity decreases were observed in the MCI group within the DMN-a sub-network, between the hippocampus and sub-areas-a and -c of the DMN, between DMN-c and DMN-a, and, in the right hemisphere only between DMN-c and both the thalamus and limbic-a. No relationships between white matter tract 'integrity' (mean diffusivity) and within sub-network functional connectivity were found.

Convenient and accurate automated segmentation of the hippocampus facilitates the analysis of large-scale neuroimaging studies. This work describes a novel technique for hippocampus segmentation in magnetic resonance images, in which interactive neural network (Inter-Net) is based on 3D convolutional operations. Inter-Net achieves the interaction through two aspects: one is the compartments, which builds an exponential ensemble network that integrates numerous short networks together when forward propagation. The other is the pathways, which realizes inter-connection between feature extraction and restoration. In addition, a multi-target architecture is proposed by designing multiple objective functions in terms of evaluation index, information theory, and data distribution. The proposed architecture is validated in fivefold cross-validation on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, where the mean Dice similarity indices of 0.919 (+/- 0.023) and precision of 0.926 (+/- 0.032) for the hippocampus segmentation. The running time is approximately 42.1 s from reading the image to outputting the segmentation result in our computer configuration. We compare the experimental results of a variety of methods to prove the effectiveness of the Inter-Net and contrast integrated architectures with different objective functions to illustrate the robustness of the fusion.

The image data were classified into NC, MCI and AD based on the findings of the neurologist. We performed data augmentation using a method such as flip, rotation, and GAN, in addition to pre-processing and data augmentation for AlexNet, in order to supplement a number of deficient data. Artificial intelligence (AI) learning was simulated using the Mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (MSGD) algorithm, and the learning rate was 5e-5, and the epoch was 100. Using a CNN and the 'AlexNet' architecture, we successfully classified F-18-FBB PET images of AD from NC where the accuracy of the test data on trained data reached 98.14%.

K.";Role of surfacelet transform in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease;MULTIDIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS AND SIGNAL PROCESSING;The clinical diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on the tedious questionnaire and prolonged tests, which require involvement of the patient, his/her family, and the clinician. Ultimately, the success of subjective evaluation depends on the expertise of the clinician. To eradicate this subjectivity, the present work proposes a method to automate the diagnosis of AD. The proposed method represents complex brain structure of the subject (captured by MRI, a safe and non-invasive medical imaging modality) in terms of quantifiable features and then performs classification of normal and AD subjects. It does so in three phases: (1) MRI volume is normalized and the gray matter, which is the most affected tissue in AD is extracted from the regions of interest.

The features are then reduced by selecting relevant and non-redundant features using a combination of Fisher discriminant ratio, and minimum redundancy and maximum relevance feature selection methods. (3) Based on these features, AD patients and normal subjects are classified using support vector machine classifier with 10 runs of 10 fold cross-validation.

It achieved 78.04%, 98.00% and 84.37% classification accuracies on the three datasets respectively. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated by comparing it with other existing methods under identical experimental settings using the above three performance measures as well as receiver operating characteristic curves, ranking and statistical tests.

Anatomically accurate, large-scale assessments of brainstem atrophy are challenging due to lack of automated, accurate segmentation methods. We present a novel method for brainstem volumetry using a fully-automated segmentation approach based on multi-dimensional gated recurrent units (MD-GRU), a deep learning based semantic segmentation approach employing a convolutional adaptation of gated recurrent units. The neural network was trained on 67 3D-high resolution T1-weighted MRI scans from MS patients and healthy controls (HC) and refined using segmentations of 20 independent MS patients' scans. Reproducibility was assessed in MR test-retest experiments in 33 HC. Accuracy and robustness were examined by Dice scores comparing MD-GRU to FreeSurfer and manual brainstem segmentations in independent MS and AD datasets. The mean %-change/SD between test-retest brainstem volumes were 0.45%/0.005 (MD-GRU), 0.95%/0.009 (FreeSurfer), 0.86%/0.007 (manually edited segmentations). Comparing MD-GRU to manually edited segmentations the mean Dice scores/SD were: 0.97/0.005 (brainstem), 0.95/0.013 (mesencephalon), 0.98/0.006 (pons), 0.95/0.015 (medulla oblongata). Compared to the manual gold standard, MD-GRU brainstem segmentations were more accurate than FreeSurfer segmentations (p < .001). In the multi-centric acquired AD data, the mean Dice score/SD for the MD-GRU-manual segmentation comparison was 0.97/0.006. The fully automated brainstem segmentation method MD-GRU provides accurate, highly reproducible, and robust segmentations in HC and patients with MS and AD in 200 s/scan on an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 GPU and shows potential for application in large and longitudinal datasets.;1065-9471;1097-0193;;OCT 1;2019;40;10.1002/hbm.24687;J

However, a large, manually annotated training dataset of labeled brain images required to train such supervised methods is frequently difficult to obtain or create. In addition, existing training datasets are generally acquired with a homogeneous magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisition protocol. CNNs trained on such datasets are unable to generalize on test data with different acquisition protocols. Modern neuroimaging studies and clinical trials are necessarily multi-center initiatives with a wide variety of acquisition protocols. Despite stringent protocol harmonization practices, it is very difficult to standardize the gamut of MRI imaging parameters across scanners, field strengths, receive coils etc., that affect image contrast. In this paper we propose a CNN-based segmentation algorithm that, in addition to being highly accurate and fast, is also resilient to variation in the input acquisition. Our approach relies on building approximate forward models of pulse sequences that produce a typical test image. For a given pulse sequence, we use its forward model to generate plausible, synthetic training examples that appear as if they were acquired in a scanner with that pulse sequence. Sampling over a wide variety of pulse sequences results in a wide variety of augmented training examples that help build an image contrast invariant model. Our method trains a single CNN that can segment input MRI images with acquisition parameters as disparate as T-1-weighted and T-2-weighted contrasts with only T-1-weighted training data. The segmentations generated are highly accurate with state-of-the-art results (overall Dice overlap = 0.94), with a fast run time (approximate to 45 s), and consistent across a wide range of acquisition protocols.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;OCT 1;2019;199;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.05.033;J

Hence, early diagnosis of such disease using computer-aided systems is a subject of great importance and extensive research amongst researchers. Nowadays, deep learning or particularly convolutional neural network (CNN) is getting more attention due to its state-of-the-art performances in variety of computer vision tasks such as visual object classification, detection and segmentation. Several recent studies, that have used brain MRI scans and deep learning have shown promising results for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. However, most common issue with deep learning architectures such as CNN is that they require large amount of data for training. In this paper, a mathematical model PFSECTL based on transfer learning is used in which a CNN architecture, VGG-16 trained on ImageNet dataset is used as a feature extractor for the classification task. Experimentation is performed on data collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database.

We aimed to develop a new deep belief network (DBN) framework using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) metabolic imaging to identify patients at the mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage with presymptomatic AD and to discriminate them from other patients with MCI. Methods: 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET images of 109 patients recruited in the ongoing longitudinal Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were included in this analysis. Patients were grouped into 2 classes: (1) stable mild cognitive impairment (n = 62) or (2) progressive mild cognitive impairment (n = 47). Our framework is composed of 4 steps: (1) image preprocessing: normalization and smoothing; (2) identification of regions of interest (ROIs); (3) feature learning using deep neural networks; and (4) classification by support vector machine with 3 kernels. All classification experiments were performed with a 5-fold cross-validation. Accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were used to validate the results. Result: A total of 1103 ROIs were obtained. One hundred features were learned from ROIs using the DBN. The classification accuracy using linear, polynomial, and RBF kernels was 83.9%, 79.2%, and 86.6%, respectively.

These images have shown great promise in revealing the altered metabolism patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The AD pathology is progressive, and leads to structural and functional alterations that lie on a continuum. There is a need to quantify the altered metabolism patterns that exist on a continuum into a simple measure. This work proposes a 3D convolutional neural network with residual connections that generates a probability score useful for interpreting the FDG-PET images along the continuum of AD. This network is trained and tested on images of stable normal control and stable Dementia of the Alzheimer's type (sDAT) subjects, achieving an AUC of 0.976 via repeated fivefold cross-validation. An independent test set consisting of images in between the two extreme ends of the DAT spectrum is used to further test the generalization performance of the network. Classification performance of 0.811 AUC is achieved in the task of predicting conversion of mild cognitive impairment to DAT for conversion time of 0-3 years.

Spontaneous activity is a source of such fluctuation. The distribution of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) between cortical pyramidal neurons can follow a log-normal distribution. Recent studies have shown that networks connected by weak synapses exhibit characteristics of a random network, whereas networks connected by strong synapses have small-world characteristics of small path lengths and large cluster coefficients. To investigate the relationship between temporal complexity spontaneous activity and structural network duality in synaptic connections, we executed a simulation study using the leaky integrate-and-fire spiking neural network with log-normal synaptic weight distribution for the EPSPs and duality of synaptic connectivity, depending on synaptic weight. We conducted multiscale entropy analysis of the temporal spiking activity. Our simulation demonstrated that, when strong synaptic connections approach a smallworld network, specific spiking patterns arise during irregular spatio-temporal spiking activity, and the complexity at the large temporal scale (i.e., slow frequency) is enhanced. Moreover, we confirmed through a surrogate data analysis that slow temporal dynamics reflect a deterministic process in the spiking neural networks. This modelling approach may improve the understanding of the spatio-temporal complex neural activity in the brain.;2045-2322;;;SEP 4;2019;9;10.1038/s41598-019-49286-8;J

Hippocampal atrophy is a validated, easily accessible, and widely used biomarker for AD diagnosis. Most of existing methods compute the shape and volume features for hippocampus analysis using structural magnetic resonance images (MRI). However, the regions adjacent to hippocampus may be relevant to AD, and the visual features of the hippocampal region are important for disease diagnosis.

It is currently not known if body composition changes and changes in fat deposition also exist in FTD, the relationship of these changes in eating behavior and appetite, and whether these changes are centrally mediated. Methods Body composition was measured in 28 people with behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 16 with Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 19 healthy controls, using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Changes in body composition were correlated to brain grey matter atrophy using voxel-based morphometry on high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Results Behavioral-variant FTD was characterized by changes in body composition, with increased total fat mass, visceral adipose tissue area (VAT area), and android: gynoid ratio compared to control and AD participants (all P values < 0.05). Changes in body composition correlated to abnormal eating behavior and behavioral change (P < 0.01) and functional decline (P < 0.01). Changes in body composition also correlated to grey matter atrophy involving a distributed neural network that included the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens, insula, cingulate, and cerebellum - structures known to be central to autonomic control - as well as the thalamus, putamen, accumbens, and caudate, which are involved in reward processing.

Early detection of AD enables family planning and may reduce costs by delaying long-term care. Accurate, non-imagery methods also reduce patient costs. The Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS-1) cross-sectional MRI data were analyzed. A gradient boosted machine (GBM) predicted the presence of AD as a function of gender, age, education, socioeconomic status (SES), and a mini-mental state exam (MMSE).

AD is a progressive and irreversible neurodegenerative disorder, which is a significant threat to people, age 65 and older. Although MCI does not always lead to AD, an early diagnosis at the stage of MCI can be very helpful in identifying people who are at risk of AD. Moreover, the early diagnosis of MCI can lead to more effective treatment, or at least, significantly delay the disease's progress, and can lead to social and financial benefits. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which has become a significant tool for the diagnosis of MCI and AD, can provide neuropsychological data for analyzing the variance in brain structure and function. MCI is divided into early and late MCI (EMCI and LMCI) and sadly, there is no clear differentiation between the brain structure of healthy people and MCI patients, especially in the EMCI stage. This paper aims to use a deep learning approach, which is one of the most powerful branches of machine learning, to discriminate between healthy people and the two types of MCI groups based on MRI results. The convolutional neural network (CNN) with an efficient architecture was used to extract high-quality features from MRIs to classify people into healthy, EMCI, or LMCI groups.

The main idea behind our research is to utilize the deep layers feature extraction benefited from deep neural network architecture, without extensive hardware resource training, and classifying the image on a basis of simple machine-learning algorithm with selected best features in order to reduce work load, classification error and hardware utilization time. We have utilized convolution neural network (CNN) layer using similar architecture like that of Alexnet with some parametric change, for the automatic extraction of features of images obtained from slice extraction of whole brain MRI whereas 13 manual features based on gray level co-occurrence matrix were also extracted to test the impact of this features on ranking. If we had only classified using CNN network, the misclassification rate was much higher. So, feature selection is achieved with feature ranking algorithms like Mutinffs, ReliefF, Laplacian and UDFS and so on and also tested with different machine-learning techniques like Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor and Subspace Ensemble under different testing condition.

A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8% for AD classification and 83.7% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0% for AD classification and 84.2% for MCI conversion prediction.

Methods PiB retention in a cortical composite of frontal, lateral, and retrosplenial regions (FLR) was measured by PiB-PET in 19 D-CAA mutation carriers (M+; 13 without neurologic symptoms, 6 with prior lobar intracerebral hemorrhage) and 17 mutation noncarriers (M-). Progression of PiB retention was analyzed in a subset of 18 serially imaged individuals (10 asymptomatic M+, 8 M-). We also analyzed associations between PiB retention and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A beta concentrations in 17 M+ and 11 M- participants who underwent lumbar puncture and compared the findings to PiB-PET and CSF A beta in 37 autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) mutation carriers. Results D-CAA M+ showed greater age-dependent FLR PiB retention (p < 0.001) than M-, and serially imaged asymptomatic M+ demonstrated greater longitudinal increases (p = 0.004). Among M+, greater FLR PiB retention associated with reduced CSF concentrations of A beta 40 (r = -0.55, p = 0.021) but not A beta 42 (r = 0.01, p = 0.991). Despite comparably low CSF A beta 40 and A beta 42, PiB retention was substantially less in D-CAA than ADAD (p < 0.001). Interpretation Increased PiB retention in D-CAA and correlation with reduced CSF A beta 40 suggest this compound labels vascular amyloid, although to a lesser degree than amyloid deposits in ADAD. Progression in PiB signal over time suggests amyloid PET as a potential biomarker in trials of candidate agents for this untreatable cause of hemorrhagic stroke.

Cognitive reserve (CR) refers to an active process that facilitates the flexibility and efficiency of the neural networks to compensate for impairments that emerge in consequence of brain pathology. The current functional magnetic resonance imaging study investigated whether and how CR affects emotional regulation, level of depression severity and neural activity associated with affective control during emotional Stroop (eStroop) task. Altogether, 90 older people participated in this study, 50 of whom suffered from LLD. We used years of education and verbal fluency capacity as proxies for CR. Clinical participants with relatively higher CR presented with milder degrees of depression, better eStroop performance and stronger neural activity in the middle frontal gyrus (MFG) involved with exercising affective control. Results of the mediation analysis indicated that both education and verbal fluency significantly mediated the association between the depression severity and MEG activity. These results suggest a negative association between CR and age-related clinical symptoms of emotional dysregulation. Our neurobehavioral findings provide supportive evidence that CR implies efficiency of top-down emotional regulation and operates as a protective factor against emotional and cognitive vulnerability in the aging brain.;1749-5016;1749-5024;;AUG;2019;14;10.1093/scan/nsz054;J

Medication trials in MCI have generally failed, but new discoveries with brain plasticity in ageing have led to the study of cognitive training as a potential treatment to improve cognitive abilities. Computerised cognitive training (CCT) involves computerised cognitive exercises that target specific cognitive abilities and neural networks to potentially improve cognitive functioning through neuroplasticity. Methods and analysis In a two-site study (New York State Psychiatric Institute/Columbia University Medical Center and Duke University Medical Center), we will randomise 100 patients with MCI (Wechsler Memory Scale-III Logical Memory II score 0-11; Folstein Mini Mental State Examination >= 23) to home-based CCT (suite of exercises: memory, matching, spatial recognition, processing speed) or a home-based active control condition (computerised crossword puzzle training (CPT)) with 12 weeks of intensive training followed by regular booster sessions up to 78 weeks. All patients will receive standard neuropsychological and functional assessments in clinic as well as structural/functional brain MRI scans at study entry and endpoint. We will test if CCT, versus CPT, leads to improved cognitive functioning, transfers to functional ability and tasks of everyday life and impacts hippocampal volume changes and changes in the default mode network of the brain measured by resting-state functional MRI. Ethics and dissemination The study will be conducted following ethics approval and written informed consent will be obtained from all subjects. Study results will be disseminated via publication, clinicaltrials.gov, media and conference presentations. This will be the first controlled long-term trial to evaluate the effects of home-based CCT versus computerised CPT on cognitive abilities and functional measures and neural outcomes as determined by MRI indices in patients with MCI.

At the systems level, this suggests anticholinergic drugs may alter the activity and interplay of anatomically distributed neural networks critical for memory function. Using a network-sensitive imaging technique (functional connectivity MRI) and a double-blind, crossover design, we examined the consequences of anticholinergic drug administration on episodic memory and functional network architecture in a group of clinically normal elderly. We observed that low-dose scopolamine (0.2 mg IV) decreased episodic memory performance and selectively decreased connectivity strength in 3 of 7 cortical networks. Both memory and connectivity effects were independent of beta-amyloid burden. Drug-induced connectivity changes within the Default and Salience networks, as well as reductions in the strength of anticorrelation between these 2 networks, were sufficient to fully statistically mediate the effects of scopolamine on memory performance. These results provide experimental support for the importance of the Default and Salience networks to memory performance and suggest scopolamine-induced amnesia is underpinned by disrupted connectivity within and between these 2 networks.

Methods: A deep learning method is developed and validated based on magnetic resonance imaging scans of 2146 subjects (803 for training and 1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD dementia in a time-to-event analysis setting. Results: The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762 on 439 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 6 to 78 months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a concordance index of 0.781 on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 18 to 54 months (quartiles: [18, 36, 54]). The predicted progression risk also clustered individual subjects into subgroups with significant differences in their progression time to AD dementia (P < .0002). Improved performance for predicting progression to AD dementia (concordance index = 0.864) was obtained when the deep learning-based progression risk was combined with baseline clinical measures. Discussion: Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means for prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.

It can be based on various criteria such as face image, DNA methylation, chest plate radiographs, knee radiographs, dental images and etc. Most of the age prediction researches have mainly been based on images. Since the image processing and Machine Learning (ML) techniques have grown up, the investigations were led to use them in age prediction problem. The implementations would be used in different fields, especially in medical applications. Brain Age Estimation (BAE) has attracted more attention in recent years and it would be so helpful in early diagnosis of some neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, Huntington, etc. BAE is performed on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) images to compute the brain ages. Studies based on brain MRI shows that there is a relation between accelerated aging and accelerated brain atrophy. This refers to the effects of neurodegenerative diseases on brain structure while making the whole of it older. This paper reviews and summarizes the main approaches for age prediction based on brain MRI images including preprocessing methods, useful tools used in different research works and the estimation algorithms. We categorize the BAE methods based on two factors, first the way of processing MRI images, which includes pixel-based, surface-based, or voxel-based methods and second, the generation of ML algorithms that includes traditional or Deep Learning (DL) methods. The modern techniques as DL methods help MRI based age prediction to get results that are more accurate. In recent years, more precise and statistical ML approaches have been utilized with the help of related tools for simplifying computations and getting accurate results. Pros and cons of each research and the challenges in each work are expressed and some guidelines and deliberations for future research are suggested.;0148-5598;1573-689X;;AUG;2019;43;10.1007/s10916-019-1401-7;J

However, the network decisions are often perceived as being highly non-transparent, making it difficult to apply these algorithms in clinical routine. In this study, we propose using layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) to visualize convolutional neural network decisions for AD based on MRI data. Similarly to other visualization methods, LRP produces a heatmap in the input space indicating the importance/relevance of each voxel contributing to the final classification outcome. In contrast to susceptibility maps produced by guided backpropagation (Which change in voxels would change the outcome most?), the LRP method is able to directly highlight positive contributions to the network classification in the input space. In particular, we show that (1) the LRP method is very specific for individuals (Why does this person have AD?) with high inter-patient variability, (2) there is very little relevance for AD in healthy controls and (3) areas that exhibit a lot of relevance correlate well with what is known from literature. To quantify the latter, we compute size-corrected metrics of the summed relevance per brain area, e.g., relevance density or relevance gain. Although these metrics produce very individual fingerprints of relevance patterns for AD patients, a lot of importance is put on areas in the temporal lobe including the hippocampus. After discussing several limitations such as sensitivity toward the underlying model and computation parameters, we conclude that LRP might have a high potential to assist clinicians in explaining neural network decisions for diagnosing AD (and potentially other diseases) based on structural MRI data.;1663-4365;;;JUL 31;2019;11;10.3389/fnagi.2019.00194;J

Existing AD detection methods rely on global feature learning from the whole brain scans, while depending on the tissue types, AD related features in different tissue regions, e.g. grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), show different characteristics. In this paper, we propose a deep learning method for multi-scale feature learning based on segmented tissue areas. A novel deep 3D multi-scale convolutional network scheme is proposed to generate multi-resolution features for AD detection. The proposed scheme employs several parallel 3D multi-scale convolutional networks, each applying to individual tissue regions (GM, WM and CSF) followed by feature fusions. The proposed fusion is applied in two separate levels: the first level fusion is applied on different scales within the same tissue region, and the second level is on different tissue regions. To further reduce the dimensions of features and mitigate overfitting, a feature boosting and dimension reduction method, XGBoost, is utilized before the classification. The proposed deep learning scheme has been tested on a moderate open dataset of ADNI (1198 scans from 337 subjects), with excellent test performance on randomly partitioned datasets (best 99.67%, average 98.29%), and good test performance on subject-separated partitioned datasets (best 94.74%, average 89.51%).

In this study, we assessed this system in distinguishing ASD subjects from children affected with other neuropsychiatric disorders (NPD). Methods. At a psychiatric practice in Texas, 20 children diagnosed with ASD and 20 children diagnosed with NPD were entered into the study. Continuous segments of artifact-free EEG data lasting 10 minutes were entered in MS-ROM/IFAST. From the new variables created by MS-ROM/IFAST, only 12 has been selected according to a correlation criterion. The selected features represent the input on which supervised machine learning systems (MLS) acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability in distinguishing ASD from other NPD cases ranged from 93% to 97.5%. The results were confirmed in further experiments in which Italian and US data have been combined. In this analysis, the best MLS reached 95.0% global accuracy in 1 out of 3 classes distinction (ASD, NPD, controls). This study demonstrates the value of EEG processing with advanced MLS in the differential diagnosis between ASD and NPD cases. The results were not affected by age, ethnicity and technicalities of EEG acquisition, confirming the existence of a specific EEG signature in ASD cases. To further support these findings, it was decided to test the behavior of already trained neural networks on 10 Italian very young ASD children (25-37 months). In this test, 9 out of 10 cases have been correctly recognized as ASD subjects in the best case. Conclusions.

The relationship between in vivo imaging measures and pathological features, at the single subject level, remains largely unknown. Patient-specific maps of atrophy and seed-based intrinsic connectivity disruption, as compared to normal controls, were obtained for 27 patients subsequently diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy (n = 16, seven males, age at death 68.9 +/- 6.0 years, imaging-to-pathology interval = 670.2 +/- 425.1 days) or corticobasal degeneration (n = 11, two males, age at death 66.7 +/- 5.4 years, imaging-to-pathology interval = 696.2 +/- 482.2 days). A linear mixed effect model with crossed random effects was used to test regional and single-subject level associations between post-mortem regional measures of neurodegeneration and tau inclusion burden, on the one hand, and regional volume loss and seed-based intrinsic connectivity reduction, on the other. A significant association was found between tau inclusion burden and in vivo volume loss, at the regional level and independent of neurodegeneration severity, in both progressive supranuclear palsy [n = 340 regions; beta 0.036; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.001, 0.072; P = 0.046] and corticobasal degeneration (n = 215 regions; beta 0.044; 95% CI: 0.009, 0.079; P = 0.013).

First, three levels of features are extracted: statistical, connectivity, and graph-based features. Then, the connectivity features are decomposed into three different sets of features according to a proposed similarity-driven ranking method, which can not only reduce the feature dimension but also increase the classifier's diversity. Last, after feeding the three levels of features to different classifiers, a new classifier selection strategy, maximum Mean squared Error (mMsE), is developed to select a pair of classifiers with high diversity.

Methods Comprehensive metabolome analysis of plasma was performed in Cohort A (controls, n = 45; PD, n = 145), followed by analysis of 7 polyamine metabolites in Cohort B (controls, n = 49; PD, n = 186; progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 19; Alzheimer disease, n = 23). Furthermore, 20 patients with PD who were successively examined within Cohort B were studied using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Association of each polyamine metabolite with disease severity was assessed according to Hoehn and Yahr stage (H&Y) and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor section (UPDRS-III). Additionally, the autophagy induction ability of each polyamine metabolite was examined in vitro in various cell lines. Results In Cohort A, N8-acetylspermidine and N-acetylputrescine levels were significantly and mildly elevated in PD, respectively. In Cohort B, spermine levels and spermine/spermidine ratio were significantly reduced in PD, concomitant with hyperacetylation. Furthermore, N1,N8-diacetylspermidine levels had the highest diagnostic value, and correlated with H&Y, UPDRS-III, and axonal degeneration quantified by DTI. The spermine/spermidine ratio in controls declined with age, but was consistently suppressed in PD. Among polyamine metabolites, spermine was the strongest autophagy inducer, especially in SH-SY5Y cells. No significant genetic variations in 5 genes encoding enzymes associated with spermine/spermidine metabolism were detected compared with controls. Interpretation Spermine synthesis and N1,N8-diacetylspermidine may respectively be useful diagnostic and severity-associated biomarkers for PD.

Many neuroimaging studies have focused on case-control classification and predicting conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer disease, but predicting scores from clinical assessments (such as the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale or the Mini Mental State Examination) using MRI data has received less attention. Predicting clinical scores can be crucial in providing a nuanced prognosis and inferring symptomatic severity. Methods We predicted clinical scores at the individual level using a novel anatomically partitioned artificial neural network (APANN) model. The model combined input from 2 structural MRI measures relevant to the neurodegenerative patterns observed in Alzheimer disease: hippocampal segmentations and cortical thickness. We evaluated the performance of the APANN model with 10 rounds of 10-fold cross-validation in 3 experiments, using cohorts from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI): ADNI1, ADNI2 and ADNI1 + 2.

"Li, Y; Meng, FQ; Shi, J";"Li, Yan; Meng, Fanqing; Shi, Jun";Learning using privileged information improves neuroimaging-based CAD of Alzheimer's disease: a comparative study;MEDICAL & BIOLOGICAL ENGINEERING & COMPUTING;The neuroimaging-based computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) for Alzheimer's disease (AD) has shown its effectiveness in recent years. In general, the multimodal neuroimaging-based CAD always outperforms the approaches based on a single modality. However, single-modal neuroimaging is more favored in clinical practice for diagnosis due to the limitations of imaging devices, especially in rural hospitals. Learning using privileged information (LUPI) is a new learning paradigm that adopts additional privileged information (PI) modality to help to train a more effective learning model during the training stage, but PI itself is not available in the testing stage. Since PI is generally related to the training samples, it is then transferred to the learned model. In this work, a LUPI-based CAD framework for AD is proposed. It can flexibly perform a classifier- or feature-level LUPI, in which the information is transferred from the additional PI modality to the diagnosis modality. A thorough comparison has been made among three classifier-level algorithms and five feature-level LUPI algorithms. The experimental results on the ADNI dataset show that all classifier-level and deep learning based feature-level LUPI algorithms can improve the performance of a single-modal neuroimaging-based CAD for AD by transferring PI.;0140-0118;1741-0444;;JUL;2019;57;10.1007/s11517-019-01974-3;J

In particular, WMH have been noteworthy in age-related neuroscience for being a crucial biomarker for all types of dementia and brain aging processes. The automatic WMH segmentation is challenging because of their variable intensity range, size and shape. U-Net tackles this problem through the dense prediction and has shown competitive performances not only on WMH segmentation/detection but also on varied image segmentation tasks. However, its network architecture is high complex. In this study, we propose the use of Saliency U-Net and Irregularity map (IAM) to decrease the U-Net architectural complexity without performance loss. We trained Saliency U-Net using both: a T2-FLAIR MRI sequence and its correspondent IAM. Since IAM guides locating image intensity irregularities, in which WMH are possibly included, in the MRI slice, Saliency U-Net performs better than the original U-Net trained only using T2-FLAIR. The best performance was achieved with fewer parameters and shorter training time. Moreover, the application of dilated convolution enhanced Saliency U-Net by recognizing the shape of large WMH more accurately through multi-context learning. This network named Dilated Saliency U-Net improved Dice coefficient score to 0.5588 which was the best score among our experimental models, and recorded a relatively good sensitivity of 0.4747 with the shortest training time and the least number of parameters. In conclusion, based on our experimental results, incorporating IAM through Dilated Saliency U-Net resulted an appropriate approach for WMH segmentation.;1663-4365;;;JUN 27;2019;11;10.3389/fnagi.2019.00150;J

The cingulate island sign (CIS) is the most recently identified specific feature of DLB for a differential diagnosis. The current study aimed to examine the usefulness of deep-learningbased imaging classification for the diagnoses of DLB and AD. Furthermore, we investigated whether CIS was emphasized by a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) during differentiation. Brain perfusion single photon emission tomography images from 80 patients, each with DLB and AD, and 80 individuals with normal cognition (NL) were used for training and 20 each for final testing. The CNN was trained on brain surface perfusion images. Gradient-weighted class activation mapping (GradCAM) was applied to the CNN to visualize the features that was emphasized by the trained CNN. The binary classifications between DLB and NL, DLB and AD, and AD and NL were 93.1%, 89.3%, and 92.4% accurate, respectively. The CIS ratios closely correlated with the output scores before softmax for DLB-AD discrimination (DLB/AD scores). The Grad-CAM highlighted CIS in the DLB discrimination. Visualization of learning process by guided Grad-CAM revealed that CIS became more focused by the CNN as the training progressed. The DLB/AD score was significantly associated with the three core features of DLB. Deep-learning-based imaging classification was useful for an objective and accurate differentiation of DLB from AD and for predicting clinical features of DLB. The CIS was identified as a specific feature during DLB classification.

Methods: Computer simulations were made for a pathological model in which Alzheimer's disease was simulated by synaptic degradation in the hippocampus. Pathology modeling was based on sequentially turning off the connections with entorhinal cortex layer 2 (EC2) and the dentate gyrus on CA3 pyramidal neurons. Gamma induction modeling consisted of simulating the oscillation provided by the septo-hippocampal pathway with band frequencies from 40-130 Hz. Pathological models with and without gamma induction were compared with a control. Results: In the hippocampal regions of DG, CA3, and CA1, and jointly DG-CA3-CA1 and CA3-CA1, gamma induction resulted in a statistically significant improvement in terms of increased numbers of spikes, spikes per burst, and burst duration as compared with the model simulating Alzheimer's disease (AD). The positive maximal Lyapunov exponent was negative in both the control model and the one with gamma induction as opposed to the pathological model where it was positive within the DG-CA3-CA1 region. Gamma induction resulted in decreased transfer entropy in accordance with the information flow in DG -> CA3 and CA3 -> CA1. Conclusions: The results of simulation studies show that inducing gamma oscillations in the hippocampus may reduce Alzheimer's disease related pathology.

The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic impact on metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks and its clinical-pathological relationships in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We separately investigated the modulation of 2 default mode subnetworks, as identified with independent component analysis, by comparing APOE-epsilon 4 carriers to noncarriers with AD. We further analyzed the interaction effects of APOE (APOE-epsilon 4 carriers vs noncarriers) with PICALM (rs3851179-GG vs rs3851179-A-allele carriers) on episodic memory (EM) deficits, reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) and decreased metabolic connectivity in default mode subnetworks.

Here we addressed this issue in an Alzheimer's disease cohort using activation fMRI of two core musical memory systems. Methods: We studied 34 patients with younger onset Alzheimer's disease led either by episodic memory decline (typical Alzheimer's disease) or by visuospatial impairment (posterior cortical atrophy) in relation to 19 age-matched healthy individuals. We designed a novel fMRI paradigm based on passive listening to melodies that were either previously familiar or unfamiliar (musical semantic memory) and either presented singly or repeated (incidental musical episodic memory). Results: Both syndromic groups showed significant functional neuroanatomical alterations relative to the healthy control group. For musical semantic memory, disease-associated activation group differences were localised to right inferior frontal cortex (reduced activation in the group with memory-led Alzheimer's disease); while for incidental musical episodic memory, disease-associated activation group differences were localised to precuneus and posterior cingulate cortex (abnormally enhanced activation in the syndromic groups). In post-scan behavioural testing, both patient groups had a deficit of musical episodic memory relative to healthy controls whereas musical semantic memory was unimpaired. Conclusions: Our findings define functional neuroanatomical substrates for the differential involvement of musical semantic and incidental episodic memory in major phenotypes of Alzheimer's disease. The complex dynamic profile of brain activation group differences observed suggests that musical memory may be an informative probe of neural network function in Alzheimer's disease. These findings may guide the development of future musical interventions in dementia. (C) 2019 The Authors.

However, ADL gradually decline in AD, impacting on advanced (a-ADL, complex interpersonal or social functioning), instrumental (IADL, maintaining life in community), and finally basic functions (BADL, activities related to physiological and self-maintenance needs). Information and communication technologies (ICT) have become an increasingly important aspect of daily functioning. Yet, the links of ADL, ICT, and neuropathology of AD dementia are poorly understood. Such knowledge is critical as it can provide biomarker evidence of functional decline in AD.MethodsADL were evaluated with the Technology-Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (T-ADLQ) in 33 patients with AD and 30 controls. ADL were divided in BADL, IADL, and a-ADL. The three domain subscores were covaried against gray matter atrophy via voxel-based morphometry.ResultsOur results showed that three domain subscores of ADL correlate with several brain structures, with a varying degree of overlap between them. BADL score correlated mostly with frontal atrophy, IADL with more widespread frontal, temporal and occipital atrophy and a-ADL with occipital and temporal atrophy. Finally, ICT subscale was associated with atrophy in the precuneus.ConclusionsThe association between ADL domains and neurodegeneration in AD follows a traceable neuropathological pathway which involves different neural networks. This the first evidence of ADL phenotypes in AD characterised by specific patterns of functional decline and well-defined neuropathological changes. The identification of such phenotypes can yield functional biomarkers for dementias such as AD.;0340-5354;1432-1459;;JUN;2019;266;10.1007/s00415-019-09260-w;J
"Bi, XJ; Wang, HB";"Bi Xiaojun; Wang Haibo";Early Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on EEG spectral images using deep learning;NEURAL NETWORKS;Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a proceeding hot issue along with a sharp upward trend in the incidence rate. Recently, early diagnosis of AD employing Electroencephalogram (EEG) as a specific hallmark has been an increasingly significant hot topic area. In consideration of the limited size of available EEG spectral images, how to extract more abstract features for better generalization still remains tremendously troubling. In this paper, we demonstrate that it can be settled well with multi-task learning strategy based on discriminative convolutional high-order Boltzmann Machine with hybrid feature maps. First, differently from our original model - Contractive Slab and Spike Convolutional Deep Boltzmann Machine (CssCDBM), we directly conduct EEG spectral image classification via inducing label layer, resulting in a discriminative version of CssCDBM, referred to as DCssCDBM. This demonstrates DCssCDBM can be extended well into the classification model instead of feature extractor alone previously. Then, the most important approach innovation is that we train our DCssCDBM with multi-task learning framework via EEG spectral images based Identification and verification tasks for overfitting reduction for the first time, which could increase the inter-subject variations and reduce the intra-subject variations respectively, both of which are essential to early diagnosis of AD. The proposed method shows the better ability of high-level representations extraction and demonstrates the advanced results over several state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

In the last decade, studies on AD diagnosis has attached great significance to artificial intelligence-based diagnostic algorithms. Among the diverse modalities of imaging data, T1-weighted MR and FDG-PET are widely used for this task. In this paper, we propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) to integrate all the multi-modality information included in both T1-MR and FDG-PET images of the hippocampal area, for the diagnosis of AD. Different from the traditional machine learning algorithms, this method does not require manually extracted features, instead, it utilizes 3D image-processing CNNs to learn features for the diagnosis or prognosis of AD. To test the performance of the proposed network, we trained the classifier with paired T1-MR and FDG-PET images in the ADNI datasets, including 731 cognitively unimpaired (labeled as CN) subjects, 647 subjects with AD, 441 subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (sMCI) and 326 subjects with progressive mild cognitive impairment (pMCI). We obtained higher accuracies of 90.10% for CN vs. AD task, 87.46% for CN vs. pMCI task, and 76.90% for sMCI vs. pMCI task. The proposed framework yields a state-of-the-art performance.

Neurophysiological variability indicates compromised regulation and organization of neural networks. Based on theories of neuronal integrity changes that accompany aging, we assessed the relative contribution of: 1) premorbid cognitive reserve, 2) current brain integrity (gray and white matter markers of neurodegenerative disease), and 3) current cognition (specifically domains of processing speed/working memory, episodic memory, and motor function) on intraoperative neurophysiological variability as measured from a common intraoperative tool, the Bispectral Index Monitor (BIS). Methods This sub-study included participants from a parent study of non-demented older adults electing unilateral Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) with the same surgeon and anesthesia protocol, who also completed a preoperative neuropsychological assessment and preoperative 3T brain magnetic resonance imaging scan. Left frontal two-channel derived EEG via the BIS was acquired preoperatively (un-medicated and awake) and continuously intraoperatively with time from tourniquet up to tourniquet down. Data analyses used correlation and regression modeling. Results Fifty-four participants met inclusion criteria for the sub-study. The mean (SD) age was 69.5 (7.4) years, 54% were male, 89% were white, and the mean (SD) American Society of Anesthesiologists score was 2.76 (0.47). We confirmed that brain integrity positively and significantly associated with each of the cognitive domains of interest. EEG intra-individual variability (squared deviation from the mean BIS value between tourniquet up and down) was significantly correlated with cognitive reserve (r = -. 40, p =.003), brain integrity (r = -. 37, p =.007), and a domain of processing speed/working memory (termed cognitive efficiency; r = -. 31, p =.021). Hierarchical regression models that sequentially included age, propofol bolus dose, cognitive reserve, brain integrity, and cognitive efficiency found that intraoperative propofol bolus dose (p =.001), premorbid cognitive reserve (p =.008), and current brain integrity (p =.004) explained a significant portion of intraoperative intra-individual variability from the BIS monitor. Conclusions Older adults with higher premorbid reserve and less brain disease were more stable intraoperatively on a depth of anesthesia monitor.

CAA-ri is likely responsive to corticosteroid. MRI shows asymmetric and multifocal white matter hyperintensity (WMH) lesions and multiple cerebral microbleeds.

It is unclear whether SORL1 is involved with CAA-ri or not.Case presentationA 48-year-old woman suffered from a one-day history of a headache, nausea, and vomiting. Neurological examination revealed normal. We diagnosed this case as probable CAA-ri according to the clinic manifestations and MRI. Gene detection indicated a rare variant in SORL1 and ApoE epsilon 4 homozygosity. When treated with corticosteroid, the patient's clinical symptoms and MRI manifestations were almost relieved. However, when keeping the corticosteroid withdrawal for three months, the patient relapsed with a headache and typical images on MRI emerged. Corticosteroid therapy was effective again. Unfortunately, susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) showed increased microbleeds.

The framework employs a random subspace ensemble-based artificial neural network classifier-in particular, a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The framework was tested on data from first-episode schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. The experiments differed in terms of feature extraction methods, using VBM, DBM, and a combination of both morphometry methods. Thus, features of different types were available for model adaptation. As we expected, the combination of features increased the MLP classification accuracy up to 73.12%-an improvement of 5% versus MLP-based only on VBM or DBM features.

N.";An efficient classification approach for detection of Alzheimer's disease from biomedical imaging modalities;MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS;The complex patterns of the neuroimaging data are analyzed successfully with bio-medical imaging applications. The patients with/without AD can be discriminated effectively through several biomedical imaging modalities such as, sMRI, fMRI, PET and so on. In this paper, brain images from structural MRI (sMRI) are used for better categorization of 3 subjects namely, NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD (Alzheimer's disease). Moreover, ambiguous training data employed for the discrimination of subjects may mislead the classifier to take incorrect decisions and in turn degrades the classification performance. In order to recover these hurdles, we propose an automated reliable system for the detection of AD affected patients accurately from the brain images of sMRI. The proposed system is a multi-stage system comprising four key phases namely, i) pre-processing, ii) feature extraction, iii) feature selection and iv) detection phase. In the initial phase, ROI regions related to Hippocampus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. In the feature extraction stage, important texture and shape features are extracted from HC and PCC involved in three brain planes. Nearly, 19 highly relevant AD related features are selected through a multiple-criterion feature selection method. It should be noted that, the class labels when explored manually consumes more time and turns to be an expensive process. Therefore, it is essential to construct an automatic method to identify irrelevant samples in the training data to enhance the decision-making process. With this in mind, at the detection phase, a novel classification technique is proposed by combining the Kernel fuzzy c-means clustering (i.e. unsupervised learning technique) and Back-propagation artificial neural network (i.e. supervised learning technique) to categorize NC, MCI and AD from the brain images of sMRI. This proposed KFCM based BPANN algorithm can improve the classification performance by removing the suspicious training samples. The proposed frameworks efficiency is evaluated with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordeaux-3 city dataset. The experimental validation of our proposed approach attains an accuracy of 97.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% for the most challenging classification tasks AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI, respectively.;1380-7501;1573-7721;;MAY;2019;78;10.1007/s11042-018-6287-8;J

In many applications, machine learning based systems have shown comparable performance to human decision-making. The applications of machine learning are the key ingredients of future clinical decision making and monitoring systems. This review covers the fundamental concepts behind various machine learning techniques and their applications in several radiological imaging areas, such as medical image segmentation, brain function studies and neurological disease diagnosis, as well as computer-aided systems, image registration, and content-based image retrieval systems. Synchronistically, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future directions regarding the application of machine learning in radiological imaging. By giving insight on how take advantage of machine learning powered applications, we expect that clinicians can prevent and diagnose diseases more accurately and efficiently.;0010-4825;1879-0534;;MAY;2019;108;10.1016/j.compbiomed.2019.02.017;J

However, they have limitations in clinical application due to the gap between the training cohorts and real-world data. We aimed to develop a model trained only by normal brain PET data with an unsupervised manner to identify an abnormality in various disorders as imaging data of the clinical routine. Methods: Using variational autoencoder, a type of unsupervised learning, Abnormality Score was defined as how far a given brain image is from the normal data. The model was applied to FDG PET data of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinical routine FDG PET data for assessing behavioral abnormality and seizures. Accuracy was measured by the area under curve (AUC) of receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve. We investigated whether deep learning has additional benefits with experts' visual interpretation to identify abnormal patterns. Findings: The AUC of the ROC curve for differentiating AD was 0.90. The changes in cognitive scores from baseline to 2-year follow-up were significantly correlated with Abnormality Score at baseline. The AUC of the ROC curve for discriminating patients with various disorders from controls was 0.74. Experts' visual interpretation was helped by the deep learning model to identify abnormal patterns in 60% of cases initially not identified without the model. Interpretation: We suggest that deep learning model trained only by normal data was applicable for identifying wide-range of abnormalities in brain diseases, even uncommon ones, proposing its possible use for interpreting real-world clinical data.

Most of existing joint learning approaches require hand-crafted feature representations for MR images. Since hand-crafted features of MRI and classification/regression models may not coordinate well with each other, conventional methods may lead to sub-optimal learning performance. Also, demographic information (e.g., age, gender, and education) of subjects may also be related to brain status, and thus can help improve the diagnostic performance. However, conventional joint learning methods seldom incorporate such demographic information into the learning models. To this end, we propose a deep multi-task multi-channel learning (DM2 L) framework for simultaneous brain disease classification and clinical score regression, using MRI data and demographic information of subjects. Specifically, we first identify the discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then extract multiple image patches around these detected landmarks. We then propose a deep multi-task multi-channel convolutional neural network for joint classification and regression. Our DM2 L framework can not only automatically learn discriminative features for MR images, but also explicitly incorporate the demographic information of subjects into the learning process. We evaluate the proposed method on four large multi-center cohorts with 1984 subjects, and the experimental results demonstrate that DM2 L is superior to several state-of-the-art joint learning methods in both the tasks of disease classification and clinical score regression.;0018-9294;1558-2531;;MAY;2019;66;10.1109/TBME.2018.2869989;J

Methods In an autopsy cohort of PPA (FTLD-TDP = 13, FTLD-Tau = 14), we analyzed laterality and regional distribution of postmortem pathology, quantified using a validated digital histopathological approach, in available brain tissue from up to 8 cortical regions bilaterally. We related digital pathology to antemortem structural neuroimaging and specific clinical language features. Results Postmortem cortical pathology was left-lateralized in both FTLD-TDP (beta = -0.15, standard error [SE] = 0.05, p = 0.007) and FTLD-Tau (beta = -0.09, SE = 0.04, p = 0.015), but the degree of lateralization decreased with greater overall dementia severity before death (beta = -8.18, SE = 3.22, p = 0.015). Among 5 core pathology regions sampled, we found greatest pathology in left orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in FTLD-TDP, which was greater than in FTLD-Tau (F = 47.07, df = 1,17, p < 0.001), and in left midfrontal cortex (MFC) in FTLD-Tau, which was greater than in FTLD-TDP (F = 19.34, df = 1,16, p < 0.001). Postmortem pathology was inversely associated with antemortem magnetic resonance imaging cortical thickness (beta = -0.04, SE = 0.01, p = 0.007) in regions matching autopsy sampling. Irrespective of PPA syndromic variant, single-word comprehension impairment was associated with greater left OFC pathology (t = -3.72, df = 10.72, p = 0.004) and nonfluent speech with greater left MFC pathology (t = -3.62, df = 12.00, p = 0.004) among the 5 core pathology regions. Interpretation In PPA, FTLD-TDP and FTLD-Tau have divergent anatomic distributions of left-lateralized postmortem pathology that relate to antemortem structural imaging and distinct language deficits. Although other brain regions may be implicated in neural networks supporting these complex language measures, our observations may eventually help to improve antemortem diagnosis of neuropathology in PPA.

Six classification problems are addressed, including the discrimination from whole-brain dynamics and separately from specific brain regions in order to highlight any alterations of the cortical regions. The results indicated a high accuracy ranging from 88.79% to 96.78% for whole-brain classification.

"Cui, RX; Liu, MH";"Cui, Ruoxuan; Liu, Manhua";RNN-based longitudinal analysis for diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease;COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairment of memory and other mental functions. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) have been widely used as an important imaging modality of brain for AD diagnosis and monitoring the disease progression. The longitudinal analysis of sequential MRIs is important to model and measure the progression of the disease along the time axis for more accurate diagnosis. Most existing methods extracted the features capturing the morphological abnormalities of brain and their longitudinal changes using MRIs and then designed a classifier to discriminate different groups. However, these methods have several limitations. First, since the feature extraction and classifier model are independent, the extracted features may not capture the full characteristics of brain abnormalities related to AD. Second, longitudinal MR images may be missing at some time points for some subjects, which results in difficulties for extraction of consistent features for longitudinal analysis. In this paper, we present a classification framework based on combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks for longitudinal analysis of structural MR images in AD diagnosis. First, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is constructed to learn the spatial features of MR images for the classification task. After that, recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with cascaded three bidirectional gated recurrent units (BGRU) layers is constructed on the outputs of CNN at multiple time points for extracting the longitudinal features for AD classification. Instead of independently performing feature extraction and classifier training, the proposed method jointly learns the spatial and longitudinal features and disease classifier, which can achieve optimal performance. In addition, the proposed method can model the longitudinal analysis using RNN from the imaging data at various time points. Our method is evaluated with the longitudinal TI-weighted MR images of 830 participants including 198 AD, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 229 normal controls (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves classification accuracy of 91.33% for AD vs. NC and 71.71% for pMCI vs. sMCI, demonstrating the promising performance for longitudinal MR image analysis.

The model of synaptic breakdown (from 13% to 50%) in the hippocampus modeling the dynamics of an Alzheimer's disease-like pathology was simulated. Modeling consisted in turning off one after the other EC2 connections and connections from the dentate gyrus on the CA3 pyramidal neurons. The pathological model of synaptic disintegration was compared to a control. The larger synaptic breakdown was associated with a statistically significant decrease in the number of spikes (R = -0.79, P < 0.001), spikes per burst (R = -0.76, P < 0.001) and burst duration (R = -0.83, P < 0.001) and an increase in the inter-burst interval (R = 0.85, P < 0.001) in DG-CA3-CA1. The positive maximal Lyapunov exponent in the control model was negative, but in the pathological model had a positive value of DG-CA3-CA1. A statistically significant decrease of Shannon entropy with the direction of information flow DG->CA3->CA1 (R = -0.79, P < 0.001) in the pathological model and a statistically significant increase with greater synaptic breakdown (R = 0.24, P < 0.05) of the CA3-CA1 region was obtained. The reduction of entropy transfer for DG->CA3 at the level of synaptic breakdown of 35% was 35%, compared with the control. Entropy transfer for CA3->CA1 at the level of synaptic breakdown of 35% increased to 95% relative to the control. The synaptic breakdown model in an Alzheimer's disease-like pathology in DG-CA3-CA1 exhibits chaotic features as opposed to the control. Synaptic breakdown in which an increase of Shannon entropy is observed indicates an irreversible process of Alzheimer's disease. The increase in synapse loss resulted in decreased information flow and entropy transfer in DG->CA3, and at the same time a strong increase in CA3->CA1.;;1099-4300;;APR;2019;21;10.3390/e21040408;J

Past acetylcholinesterase positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies implicate cholinergic changes as significant contributors to PIGD features. These studies were limited in quantification of striatal cholinergic synapse integrity. Vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) PET ligands are better suited for evaluation of high binding areas. We examined associations between regional VAChT expression and freezing of gait (FoG) and falls. Methods Ninety-four PD subjects underwent clinical assessment and VAChT ([F-18]FEOBV) PET. Results Thirty-five subjects (37.2%) reported a history of falls, and 15 (16%) had observed FoG. Univariate volume-of-interest analyses demonstrated significantly reduced thalamic (p = 0.0016) VAChT expression in fallers compared to nonfallers. VAChT expression was significantly reduced in the striatum (p = 0.0012) and limbic archicortex (p = 0.004) in freezers compared to nonfreezers. Whole-brain voxel-based analyses of FEOBV PET complemented these findings and showed more granular changes associated with falling history, including the right visual thalamus (especially the right lateral geniculate nucleus [LGN]), right caudate nucleus, and bilateral prefrontal regions. Freezers had prominent VAChT expression reductions in the bilateral striatum, temporal, and mesiofrontal limbic regions. Interpretation Our findings confirm and extend on previous PET findings of thalamic cholinergic deficits associated with falling history and now emphasize right visual thalamus complex changes, including the right LGN. FoG status is associated with reduced VAChT expression in striatal cholinergic interneurons and the limbic archicortex.

Jorge; Modat, Marc; Ourselin, Sebastien; Sorensen, Lauge";Training recurrent neural networks robust to incomplete data: Application to Alzheimer's disease progression modeling;MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS;Disease progression modeling (DPM) using longitudinal data is a challenging machine learning task. Existing DPM algorithms neglect temporal dependencies among measurements, make parametric assumptions about biomarker trajectories, do not model multiple biomarkers jointly, and need an alignment of subjects' trajectories. In this paper, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are utilized to address these issues. However, in many cases, longitudinal cohorts contain incomplete data, which hinders the application of standard RNNs and requires a pre-processing step such as imputation of the missing values. Instead, we propose a generalized training rule for the most widely used RNN architecture, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, that can handle both missing predictor and target values. The proposed LSTM algorithm is applied to model the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using six volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers, i.e., volumes of ventricles, hippocampus, whole brain, fusiform, middle temporal gyrus, and entorhinal cortex, and it is compared to standard LSTM networks with data imputation and a parametric, regression-based DPM method. The results show that the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower mean absolute error (MAE) than the alternatives with p < 0.05 using Wilcoxon signed rank test in predicting values of almost all of the MRI biomarkers. Moreover, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier applied to the predicted biomarker values produces a significantly larger area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.90 vs. at most 0.84 with p < 0.001 using McNemar's test for clinical diagnosis of AD. Inspection of MAE curves as a function of the amount of missing data reveals that the proposed LSTM algorithm achieves the best performance up until more than 74% missing values. Finally, it is illustrated how the method can successfully be applied to data with varying time intervals. This paper shows that built-in handling of missing values in training an LSTM network benefits the application of RNNs in neurodegenerative disease progression modeling in longitudinal cohorts.

However, how DTI changes related to the development of Amyloid beta (A beta) and tau pathology, two key hallmarks of AD, remain elusive. We hypothesized that tauopathy induced by A beta could initiate an axonal degeneration, leading to DTI-detectable white matter abnormalities. We utilized the visual system of the transgenic p301L tau mice as a model system. A beta was injected in Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (LGN), where the Retinal Ganglion Cell (RGC) axons terminate. Longitudinal DTI was conducted to detect changes in the optic tract (OT) and optic nerve (ON), containing the distal and proximal segments of RGC axons, respectively. Our results showed DTI changes in OT (significant 13.2% reduction in axial diffusion, AxD vs. vehicle controls) followed by significant alterations in ON AxD and fractional anisotropy, FA. Histology data revealed loss of synapses, RGC axons and cell bodies resulting from the A beta injection. We further tested whether microtubule-stabilizing compound Epothilone D (EpoD) could ameliorate the damage. EpoD co-treatment with A beta was sufficient to prevent A beta-induced axon and cell loss. Using an acute injection paradigm, our data suggest that EpoD may mediate its protective effect by blocking localized, acute A beta-induced tau phosphorylation. This study demonstrates white matter disruption resulting from localized A beta, the importance of tau pathology induction to changes in white matter connectivity, and the use of EpoD as a potential therapeutic avenue to prevent the axon loss in AD.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;APR 1;2019;189;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.007;J

To identify and choose effective and personalized strategies to prevent or slow the progression of AD, we need to develop objective measures that are able to discriminate the MCI patients who are at risk of AD from those MCI patients who have less risk to develop AD. Here, we present a novel deep learning architecture, based on dual learning and an ad hoc layer for 3D separable convolutions, which aims at identifying MCI patients who have a high likelihood of developing AD within 3 years. Our deep learning procedures combine structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 genetic data as input measures. The most novel characteristics of our machine learning model compared to previous ones are the following: 1) our deep learning model is multi-tasking, in the sense that it jointly learns to simultaneously predict both MCI to AD conversion as well as AD vs. healthy controls classification, which facilitates relevant feature extraction for AD prognostication; 2) the neural network classifier employs fewer parameters than other deep learning architectures which significantly limits data-overfitting (we use similar to 550,000 network parameters, which is orders of magnitude lower than other network designs); 3) both structural MRI images and their warp field characteristics, which quantify local volumetric changes in relation to the MRI template, were used as separate input streams to extract as much information as possible from the MRI data. All analyses were performed on a subset of the database made publicly available via the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), (n = 785 participants, n = 192 AD patients, n = 409 MCI patients (including both MCI patients who convert to AD and MCI patients who do not covert to AD), and n = 184 healthy controls). The most predictive combination of inputs were the structural MRI images and the demographic, neuropsychological, and APOe4 data. In contrast, the warp field metrics were of little added predictive value. The algorithm was able to distinguish the MCI patients developing AD within 3 years from those patients with stable MCI over the same time-period with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.925 and a 10-fold cross-validated accuracy of 86%, a sensitivity of 87.5%, and specificity of 85%. To our knowledge, this is the highest performance achieved so far using similar datasets. The same network provided an AUC of 1 and 100% accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when classifying patients with AD from healthy controls. Our classification framework was also robust to the use of different co-registration templates and potentially irrelevant features/image portions. Our approach is flexible and can in principle integrate other imaging modalities, such as PET, and diverse other sets of clinical data. The convolutional framework is potentially applicable to any 3D image dataset and gives the flexibility to design a computer-aided diagnosis system targeting the prediction of several medical conditions and neuropsychiatric disorders via multi-modal imaging and tabular clinical data.";1053-8119;1095-9572;;APR 1;2019;189;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.01.031;J

Currently, computer-aided diagnosis of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using F-18-fluorodeoxy-glucose positron emission tomography (F-18-FDG PET) imaging is usually based on low-level imaging features or deep learning methods, which have difficulties in achieving sufficient classification accuracy or lack clinical significance. This research therefore aimed to implement a new feature extraction method known as radiomics, to improve the classification accuracy and discover high-order features that can reveal pathological information. Methods: In this study, F-18-FDG PET and clinical assessments were collected in a cohort of 422 individuals [including 130 with AD, 130 with MCI, and 162 healthy controls (HCs)] from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and 44 individuals (including 22 with AD, and 22 HCs) from Huashan Hospital, Shanghai, China. First, we performed a group comparison using a two-sample Student's t test to determine the regions of interest (ROIs) based on 30 AD patients and 30 HCs from ADNI cohorts. Second, based on two time scans of 32 HCs from ADNI cohorts, we used Cronbach's alpha coefficient for radiomic feature stability analyses. Pearson's correlation coefficients were regarded as a feature selection criterion, to select effective features associated with the clinical cognitive scale [clinical dementia rating scale in its sum of boxes (CDRSB); Alzheimer's disease assessment scale (ADAS)] with 500-times cross-validation. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) was used to test the ability of the radiomic features to classify HCs, MCI and AD patients. Results: As a result, we identified brain regions which were mainly distributed in the temporal, occipital and frontal areas as ROIs. A total of 168 radiomic features of AD were stable (alpha > 0.8). The classification experiment led to maximal accuracies of 91.5%, 83.1% and 85.9% for classifying AD versus HC, MCI versus HCs and AD versus MCI. Conclusion: The research in this paper proved that the novel approach based on high-order radiomic features extracted from F-18-FDG PET brain images that can be used for AD and MCI computer-aided diagnosis.";1756-2856;1756-2864;;MAR;2019;12;10.1177/1756286419838682;J

The limitations of a binary classification of scans, the possibility to obtain early images as a surrogate marker of regional cerebral bloos flow, the need for (semi-) quantification and. thus, the opportunity of ranking brain amyloidosis, the correlation with A beta(42) levels in the cerebrospinal fluid, the occurrence and biological meaning of uncertain/boderline scans, the issue of incidental amyloidosis, the technical pittfalls leading to false negative/positive results, the position of the tool in the diagnostic flow-chart in the national reality. are the main topics that have been discussed. Also, a card to justify the examination to be filled by the dementia specialist and a card for the nuclear medicine physician to report the exam in detail have been approved and are available in the web, which should facilitate the creation of a national register, as previewed by the 2015 intersocietal recommendation on the use of amyloid PET in Italy.

Dementia from Alzheimer's is an agglomerated result of complex criteria taking roots at both medical, social, educational backgrounds. There being multiple predictive features for the mental state of a subject, machine learning methodologies are ideal for classification due to their extremely powerful feature-learning capabilities. This study primarily attempts to classify subjects as having or not having the early symptoms of the disease and on the sidelines, endeavors to detect if a subject has already transformed towards Alzheimer's. The research utilizes the OASIS (Open Access Series of Imaging Studies) longitudinal dataset which has a uniform distribution of demented, nondemented subjects and establishes the use of novel features such as socio-economic status and educational background for early detection of dementia, proven by performing exploratory data analysis. This research exploits three data-engineered versions of the OASIS dataset with one eliminating the incomplete cases, another one with synthetically imputed data and lastly, one that eliminates gender as a feature-eventually producing the best results and making the model a gender-neutral unique piece. The neural network applied is of three layers with two ReLU hidden layers and a third softmax classification layer. The best accuracy of 86.49% obtained on cross-validation set upon trained parameters is greater than traditional learning algorithms applied previously on the same data. Drilling down to two classes namely demented and non-demented, 100% accuracy has been remarkably achieved. Additionally, perfect recall and a precision of 0.8696 for the 'demented' class have been achieved. The significance of this work consists in endorsing educational, socio-economic factors as useful features and eliminating the gender-bias using a simple neural network model without the need for complete MRI tuples that can be compensated for using specialized imputation methods.;2158-107X;2156-5570;;MAR;2019;10;;J

Thus, exploratory and discriminative analysis techniques aiming to obtain representative features from the images play a decisive role in the design of effective Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems, which is especially important in the early diagnosis of dementia. In this work, we present a technique that allows using specific time series analysis techniques with 3D images. This is achieved by sampling the image using a fractal-based method which preserves the spatial relationship among voxels. In addition, a method called Empirical functional PCA (EfPCA) is presented, which combines Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) with functional PCA to express an image in the space spanned by a basis of empirical functions, instead of using components computed by a predefined basis as in Fourier or Wavelet analysis. The devised technique has been used to classify images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) and the Parkinson Progression Markers Initiative (PPMI), achieving accuracies up to 93% and 92% differential diagnosis tasks (AD versus controls and PD versus Controls, respectively). The results obtained validate the method, proving that the information retrieved by our methodology is significantly linked to the diseases.;0129-0657;1793-6462;;MAR;2019;29;10.1142/S0129065718500405;J

Several types of physiological signals can be analyzed to accurately detect PD by using machine learning methods. This work considers the diagnosis of PD based on voice patterns. In particular, we focus on assessing the performance of eight different pattern ranking techniques (also termed feature selection methods) when coupled with nonlinear support vector machine (SVM) to distinguish between PD patients and healthy control subjects. The parameters of the radial basis function kernel of the SVM classifier were optimized by using Bayesian optimization technique. Our results show that the receiver operating characteristic and the Wilcoxon-based ranking techniques provide the highest sensitivity and specificity. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: Patients underwent whole-brain diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, detailed neuropsychological test and [F-18]-Florbetaben amyloid positron emission tomography. We performed the NBS analysis to compare the whole-brain white matter structural networks extracted from diffusion tensor images. Results: One hundred sixteen participants (A beta- cognitively normal [CN], n = 35; A beta- aMCI, n = 42; A beta+ aMCI, n = 39) were included. There was no subnetwork showing significant difference between A beta+ aMCI and A beta- aMCI. However, by comparing each aMCI group with control group, we found that supplementary motor areas were common hub regions. Intriguingly, A beta+ aMCI showed reduced connectivity mainly in the medial frontal regions, while A beta- aMCI showed somewhat uniform disruption when compared to CN.

Machine learning and multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) for the diagnosis of brain disorders are explicitly attracting attention in the neuroimaging community. In this paper, we propose a voxel-wise discriminative framework applied to multi-measure resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) that integrates hybrid MVPA and extreme learning machine (ELM) for the automated discrimination of AD and MCI from the cognitive normal (CN) state. Materials and methods We used two rs-fMRI cohorts: the public Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative database (ADNI2) and an in-house Alzheimer's disease cohort from South Korea, both including individuals with AD, MCI, and normal controls. After extracting three-dimensional (3-D) patterns measuring regional coherence and functional connectivity during the resting state, we performed univariate statistical t-tests to generate a 3-D mask that retained only voxels showing significant changes. Given the initial univariate features, to enhance discriminative patterns, we implemented MVPA feature reduction using support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE), and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), in combination with the univariate t-test. Classifications were performed by an ELM, and its efficiency was compared to linear and nonlinear (radial basis function) SVMs. Results The maximal accuracies achieved by the method in the ADNI2 cohort were 98.86% (p<0.001) and 98.57% (p<0.001) for AD and MCI vs. CN, respectively. In the in-house cohort, the same accuracies were 98.70% (p<0.001) and 94.16% (p<0.001). Conclusion From a clinical perspective, combining extreme learning machine and hybrid MVPA applied on concatenations of multiple rs-fMRI biomarkers can potentially assist the clinicians in AD and MCI diagnosis.;1932-6203;;;FEB 22;2019;14;10.1371/journal.pone.0212582;J
"Zhou, T; Thung, KH; Zhu, XF; Shen, DG";"Zhou, Tao; Thung, Kim-Han; Zhu, Xiaofeng; Shen, Dinggang";Effective feature learning and fusion of multimodality data using stage-wise deep neural network for dementia diagnosis;HUMAN BRAIN MAPPING;In this article, the authors aim to maximally utilize multimodality neuroimaging and genetic data for identifying Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal status, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), from normal aging subjects. Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights into brain abnormalities, while genetic data such as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient's AD risk factors. When these data are used together, the accuracy of AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., with different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., with far less number of PET samples than the number of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combinations of modalities, via effective training using the maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity among modalities can be partially addressed, and high-level features from different modalities can be combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. To further increase the number of samples during training, we also use data at multiple scanning time points for each training subject in the dataset. We evaluate the proposed framework using Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) dataset for AD diagnosis, and the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.;1065-9471;1097-0193;;FEB 15;2019;40;10.1002/hbm.24428;J

It is critical for timely treatment to detect AD in its earlier stage before clinical manifestation. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is an intermediate stage between cognitively normal older adults and AD. To predict conversion from MCI to probable AD, we applied a deep learning approach, multimodal recurrent neural network. We developed an integrative framework that combines not only cross-sectional neuroimaging biomarkers at baseline but also longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and cognitive performance biomarkers obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort (ADNI). The proposed framework integrated longitudinal multi-domain data. Our results showed that 1) our prediction model for MCI conversion to AD yielded up to 75% accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.83) when using only single modality of data separately; and 2) our prediction model achieved the best performance with 81% accuracy (AUC = 0.86) when incorporating longitudinal multi-domain data.

An efficient method is proposed to detect the Alzheimer's disease in the early stage using magnetic resonance imaging. k-Means clustering is used to develop the proposed method for efficient segmentation of the white matter, cerebrospinal fluid, and grey matter. The amalgam feature vectors are formed using the grey-level co-occurrence matrix and speeded-up robust features based on textural feature extraction. Statistical and histogram of gradients is used from shape-based features. Fisher linear discriminant analysis is used for dimensionality reduction and the resampling method is used to handle the class imbalance problem. The algorithm is evaluated using the three classifiers k-nearest neighbour, support vector machine and random forest. The dataset of OASIS is used to assess the outcomes. The proposed approach achieved the optimum accuracy of 92.7%.;1550-1477;;;FEB 8;2019;15;10.1177/1550147719826048;J
"Duraisamy, B; Shanmugam, JV; Annamalai, J";"Duraisamy, Baskar; Shanmugam, Jayanthi Venkatraman; Annamalai, Jayanthi";Alzheimer disease detection from structural MR images using FCM based weighted probabilistic neural network;BRAIN IMAGING AND BEHAVIOR;An early intervention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is highly essential due to the fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major life-threatening issues, especially memory loss among patients in society. Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The experimental results suggest that the removal of noisy samples from the training data can enhance the decision generation process of the expert systems.;1931-7557;1931-7565;;FEB;2019;13;10.1007/s11682-018-9831-2;J

However, effective connectivity (EC) reflects the direct causal effects of one brain region to another, which has rarely been investigated. Recently, Granger causality analysis (GCA) proved suitable for the study of directionality in neuronal interactions. Using GCA, we examined the differences in the EC between the anterior medial prefrontal cortex/posterior cingulate cortex (aMPFC/PCC) and the whole brain in 17 epsilon 4 carrying and 32 non-carrying cognitively intact elderly individuals. Furthermore, correlation analyses were performed between the abnormal EC and cognition/neuropathological indices. Compared with the non-carriers, the results showed that the epsilon 4 carriers exhibited decreased EC from the PCC to the whole brain in the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and the precuneus (PCu). Meanwhile, the epsilon 4 carriers demonstrated increased EC from the whole brain to the aMPFC in the inferior parietal lobe (IPL) and the postcentral gyrus (PCG). The correlation analyses suggested that the EC from the IPL/PCG to the aMPFC was related to episodic memory in non-carriers, while the decreased EC from the PCC to the ACC was associated with increased levels of t-tau in the epsilon 4 carriers. In epsilon 4 carriers, a negative influence can be traced from the PCC to both the anterior and posterior DMN subsystems; meanwhile, the anterior DMN subsystem receives compensatory effects from the parietal cortex. Early increases in AD-related pathologies in the PCC may act as first factors during this pathological process.";1931-7557;1931-7565;;FEB;2019;13;10.1007/s11682-018-9857-5;J

The association and interaction of these proteinopathies with prospective cognitive decline in normal aging and preclinical Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be fully elucidated. Methods One hundred thirty-seven older individuals (age = 76.3 +/- 6.22 years) participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study underwent A beta (C-11-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (F-18-flortaucipir) positron emission tomography (PET) with prospective neuropsychological assessments following PET imaging (mean number of cognitive visits = 2.8 +/- 1.1). Tau and A beta PET measures were assessed in regions of interest (ROIs) as well as vertex-wise map analyses. Cognitive change was evaluated with Memory and Executive Function composites. Results Higher levels of A beta and tau were both associated with greater memory decline, but not with change in executive function. Higher cortical A beta was associated with higher tau levels in all ROIs, independent of age, and very elevated levels of tau were observed primarily in clinically normal with elevated A beta. A significant interaction between tau and A beta was observed in both ROI and map-level analyses, such that rapid prospective memory decline was observed in participants who had high levels of both pathologies. Interpretation Our results are consistent with the supposition that both A beta and tau are necessary for memory decline in the preclinical stages of AD. These findings may be relevant for disambiguating aging and early cognitive manifestations of AD, and to inform secondary prevention trials in preclinical AD.

Methods Two longitudinal flortaucipir (FTP) positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were acquired from 42 OA (21 Pittsburg compound B [PiB](+), age = 77.6 +/- 4.6 years, 25 female [F]/17 male [M]) and 19 PiB(+) patients with AD (age = 63.1 +/- 10.3 years, 12 F/7 M) over 1 to 3 years of follow-up. FTP change, structural MRI measures of atrophy, and cross-modal correlations were examined on a voxelwise level. Regional annual percentage change in FTP was also calculated. Results Voxelwise FTP change in AD showed the greatest increases in lateral and medial frontal lobes. Atrophy over the same interval was more widespread and included posteromedial cortical areas, where tau accumulation rates were lower. In OA, FTP binding increased in bilateral temporal lobe and retrosplenial cortex, accompanied by atrophy in the same regions. There were no associations between voxelwise change in FTP and sex, PiB, or APOE. Regional FTP significantly increased at follow-up in OA and patients with AD. Mixed effects models showed greater FTP increases in AD compared to OA, and no differences within OA based on PiB status. Interpretation Our findings indicate that tau accumulates even in amyloid-negative healthy OA and this process can be measured with in vivo tau-PET. In OA, tau accumulation and atrophy share a similar topography. In AD, tau increases more rapidly and accumulation occurs in frontal regions that are not yet undergoing significant atrophy.

The extent to which cerebrovascular disease influences the progression of AD pathology remains unclear. Leveraging newly available positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, we examined whether a well-validated measure of systemic vascular risk and beta-amyloid (A beta) burden have an interactive association with regional tau burden. Methods Vascular risk was quantified at baseline in 152 clinically normal older adults (mean age = 73.5 +/- 6.1 years) with the office-based Framingham Heart Study cardiovascular disease risk algorithm (FHS-CVD). We acquired A beta (C-11-Pittsburgh compound B) and tau (F-18-flortaucipir) PET imaging on the same participants. A beta PET was performed at baseline; tau PET was acquired on average 2.98 +/- 1.1 years later. Tau was measured in the entorhinal cortex (EC), an early site of tau deposition, and in the inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an early site of neocortical tau accumulation associated with AD. Linear regression models examined FHS-CVD and A beta as interactive predictors of tau deposition, adjusting for age, sex, APOE epsilon 4 status, and the time interval between baseline and the tau PET scan. Results We observed a significant interaction between FHS-CVD and A beta burden on subsequently measured ITC tau (p < 0.001), whereby combined higher FHS-CVD and elevated A beta burden was associated with increased tau. The interaction was not significant for EC tau (p = 0.16). Interpretation Elevated vascular risk may influence tau burden when coupled with high A beta burden. These results suggest a potential link between vascular risk and tau pathology in preclinical AD.

Materials and Methods: Prospective F-18-FDG PET brain images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) (2109 imaging studies from 2005 to 2017, 1002 patients) and retrospective independent test set (40 imaging studies from 2006 to 2016, 40 patients) were collected. Final clinical diagnosis at follow-up was recorded. Convolutional neural network of InceptionV3 architecture was trained on 90% of ADNI data set and tested on the remaining 10%, as well as the independent test set, with performance compared to radiologic readers. Model was analyzed with sensitivity, specificity, receiver operating characteristic (ROC), saliency map, and t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding. Results: The algorithm achieved area under the ROC curve of 0.98 (95% confidence interval: 0.94, 1.00) when evaluated on predicting the final clinical diagnosis of AD in the independent test set (82% specificity at 100% sensitivity), an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis, which in ROC space outperformed reader performance (57% [four of seven] sensitivity, 91% [30 of 33] specificity; P<.05). Saliency map demonstrated attention to known areas of interest but with focus on the entire brain. Conclusion: By using fluorine 18 fluorodeoxyglucose PET of the brain, a deep learning algorithm developed for early prediction of Alzheimer disease achieved 82% specificity at 100% sensitivity, an average of 75.8 months prior to the final diagnosis.

We introduce QuickNAT, a fully convolutional, densely connected neural network that segments a MRI brain scan in 20 s. To enable training of the complex network with millions of learnable parameters using limited annotated data, we propose to first pre-train on auxiliary labels created from existing segmentation software. Subsequently, the pre-trained model is fine-tuned on manual labels to rectify errors in auxiliary labels. With this learning strategy, we are able to use large neuroimaging repositories without manual annotations for training. In an extensive set of evaluations on eight datasets that cover a wide age range, pathology, and different scanners, we demonstrate that QuickNAT achieves superior segmentation accuracy and reliability in comparison to state-of-the-art methods, while being orders of magnitude faster.

Often, approaches are limited to group-level predictions, lack the ability to extrapolate, can not scale to many samples, or do not operate directly on image inputs. We address these issues with the first approach to artificial aging of brain images based on Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks. We develop a novel recursive generator model for brain image time series, and train it on large-scale longitudinal data sets (ADNI/AIBL). In addition to thorough analysis of results on healthy and demented subjects, we demonstrate the predictive value of our brain aging model in the context of conversion prognosis from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease. Conversion prognosis for a baseline image is achieved in two steps. First, we estimate the future brain image with the Generative Adversarial Network. This follow-up image is passed to a CNN classifier, pre-trained to discriminate between mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. It estimates the Alzheimer probability for the follow-up image, which represents an effective measure for future disease risk.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-33676-9; 978-3-030-33675-2";;2019;11824;10.1007/978-3-030-33676-9_17;S

The electroencephalogram equipment is a less expensive, less invasive and a more portable option that image ones so there is an increased interest in an EEG based methodology for cognitive impairment diagnosis. In this work is presented an eyes closed resting state condition EEG signal diagnosis tool, based on wavelet decomposition and wavelet entropy. The methodology allows discriminating among Healthy, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's disease people. For this purpose theta band-EEG power ratio, beta band-EEG power ratio and entropy values distribution through time in 14 electrodes are used. Wavelet decomposition is performed on five levels using Haar wavelet mother on two seconds windows. After decomposition wavelet power ratio and entropy distribution calculation are performed. The characteristics are used in a Healthy-MCI, Healthy-AD and MCI-AD classification using Support Vector Machine with polynomial kernel providing six inputs to a neural network (two layer, 13 neurons in the hidden layer) in charge of the final classification. Data base is composed of 17 healthy, nine Mild Cognitive Impairment and 15 Alzheimer's disease people registers. A precision of 92.68% to 97.56% is achieved, better or equal to other entropy-based methods with the advantage of separating the three groups and use a bigger database.

In order to effectively apply deep learning framework liar PET image analysis to overcome its limitation on Euclidean grid, we develop a solution for 3D PET image representation and analysis under a generalized, graph-based CNN architecture (PETNet), which analyzes PET signals defined on a group-wise inferred graph structure. Computations in PETNet are defined in non-Euclidean, graph (network) domain, as it performs feature extraction by convolution operations on spectral-filtered signals on the graph and pooling operations based on hierarchical graph clustering.

In order to diagnose the disease more accurately, machine learning has been widely used. However, deep learning still has a broad application space.

The recent success of deep learning techniques has rapidly advanced the automatic classification of AD using neuroimaging biomarkers such as MRI. However, there exist two major challenges. First, training a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) from scratch relies on a large number of labeled training data to obtain high accuracy without overfitting. Second, due to high computational cost, most of the existing techniques employ 2D CNN that cannot leverage the complete spatial information; hence, it loses the inter-slice correlation. To address these limitations, we combine a recurrent neural network (RNN), specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) on top of the bottleneck layer of pre-trained DenseNet architecture, a deep CNN has already been trained on a large-scale dataset called ImageNet. In addition to the intra-slice features extracted from the deep CNN, the proposed technique exploits the inter-slice features through LSTM in order to discriminate the patients having AD and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status from the brain MRI data.

Generically regarding the different neuroimaging modalities as filtered, complementary insights of brain's anatomical and functional organization, multimodal data fusion could be hypothesized to enhance the predictive power as compared to a unimodal prediction of disease progression. More recently, deep learning (DL) based methods on structural MRI (sMRI) data have outperformed classical machine learning approaches in several neuroimaging applications including diagnostic classification and prediction. Similarly, functional MRI (fMRI) features estimated using a dynamic (i.e. time-varying) functional connectivity (FC) approach have been found to be more discriminative and predictive of the clinical diagnosis than those based on the static FC approach. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel multimodal data fusion framework featuring deep residual learning of non-linear sMRI features and dynamic FC (dFC) based extraction of fMRI features to predict the subset of individuals with mild cognitive impairments who would progress to Alzheimer's disease within a time-period of three years from the baseline scanning sessions. Our cross-validated results from the developed multimodal (sMRI-fMRI) data fusion framework demonstrate a significant improvement in performance over the unimodal prediction analyses with the fMRI (p = 7.03 x 10(-7)) and sMRI (p = 6.72 x 10(-4)) modalities. As such, the findings in this work highlight the benefits of combining multiple neuroimaging data modalities via data fusion, corroborate the predictive value of the tested DL and dFC features and argue in favor of exploration of similar approaches to learn neuroanatomical and functional alterations in the neuroimaging data.;1557-170X;1558-4615;978-1-5386-1311-5;;2019;;;S

So, the image retrieval technique plays an important role to assist the doctors to carefully examine an image of a new patient by comparing with most similar images existing in the database and also to take a correct decision during diagnosis. So, we carried out our studies by collecting the images of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) from the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database.

Thus, we obtain multiple textural features using Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Law Texture Energy Measure. After obtaining the textural features, the top matched images are retrieved based on the similarity measure computed between the feature vector of a query image and the images present in the database. Finally, the retrieval performance is compared for the extracted texture features from GLCM, Laws Texture Energy Measure and a combination of these two methods.

Nowadays, Alzheimer's disease represents a significant public health concern and has been identified as a research priority. Most unfortunately, there is little chance of a cure for Alzheimer's disease, and the disease is difficult to detect before the dominant characteristics such as memory loss are manifested. Therefore, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease has become an urgent problem today.

Instead of a recurrent model which poses computational/technical issues, and inspired by recent results showing the viability of dilated convolutional models for sequence prediction, we develop a dilated convolutional neural network architecture for this task. On the technical side, we show how the modules needed in our network can be derived while explicitly taking the Riemannian manifold structure into account. We show how the operations needed can leverage known results for calculating the weighted Frechet Mean (wFM). Finally, we present scientific results for group difference analysis in Alzheimer's disease (AD) where the groups are derived using AD pathology load: here the model finds several brain fiber bundles that are related to AD even when the subjects are all still cognitively healthy.;1550-5499;;978-1-7281-4803-8;;2019;;10.1109/ICCV.2019.01072;S

Longitudinal image acquisitions are common in various scientific and biomedical studies where often each image sequence sample may also come together with various secondary (fixed or temporally dependent) measurements. The key goal is not only to estimate the parameters of a deep generative model for the given longitudinal data, but also to enable evaluation of how the temporal course of the generated longitudinal samples are influenced as a function of induced changes in the (secondary) temporal measurements (or events). Our proposed formulation incorporates recurrent subnetworks and temporal context gating, which provide a smooth transition in a temporal sequence of generated data that can be easily informed or modulated by secondary temporal conditioning variables. We show that the formulation works well despite the smaller sample sizes common in these applications. Our model is validated on two video datasets and a longitudinal Alzheimer's disease (AD) dataset for both quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated samples. Further, using our generated longitudinal image samples, we show that we can capture the pathological progressions in the brain that turn out to be consistent with the existing literature, and could facilitate various types of downstream statistical analysis.;1550-5499;;978-1-7281-4803-8;;2019;;10.1109/ICCV.2019.01079;S

To utilize all available subjects to train diagnostic models, deep networks have been proposed to directly impute missing neuroimages by treating all voxels in a 3D volume equally. These methods are not diagnosis-oriented, as they ignore the disease-image specific information conveyed in multi-modal neuroimages, i.e., (1) disease may cause abnormalities only at local brain regions, and (2) different modalities may highlight different disease-associated regions. In this paper, we propose a unified disease-image specific deep learning framework for joint image synthesis and disease diagnosis using incomplete multi-modal neuroimaging data. Specifically, by using the whole-brain images as input, we design a disease-image specific neural network (DSNN) to implicitly model disease-image specificity in MRI/PET scans using the spatial cosine kernel. Moreover, we develop a feature-consistent generative adversarial network (FGAN) to synthesize missing images, encouraging DSNN feature maps of synthetic images and their respective real images to be consistent. Our DSNN and FGAN can be jointly trained, by which missing images are imputed in a task-oriented manner for brain disease diagnosis. Experimental results on 1, 466 subjects suggest that our method not only generates reasonable neuroimages, but also achieves the state-of-the-art performance in both tasks of Alzheimer's disease (AD) identification and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-32248-9; 978-3-030-32247-2";;2019;11766;10.1007/978-3-030-32248-9_16;S

This capability is valuable for secondary prevention clinical trials where outcomes and screening criteria involve neuroimaging. Traditional computational methods are limited by imposing a parametric model for atrophy and are extremely resource-demanding. Recent advances in deep learning have yielded data-driven models for longitudinal studies (e.g., face ageing) that are capable of generating synthetic images in real-time. Similar solutions can be used to model trajectories of atrophy in the brain, although new challenges need to be addressed to ensure accurate disease progression modelling. Here we propose Degenerative Adversarial NeuroImage Net (DaniNet)-a new deep learning approach that learns to emulate the effect of neurodegeneration on MRI by simulating atrophy as a function of ages, and disease progression. DaniNet uses an underlying set of Support Vector Regressors (SVRs) trained to capture the patterns of regional intensity changes that accompany disease progression. DaniNet produces whole output images, consisting of 2D-MRI slices that are constrained to match regional predictions from the SVRs. DaniNet is also able to maintain the unique brain morphology of individuals. Adversarial training ensures realistic brain images and smooth temporal progression. We train our model using 9652 T1-weighted (longitudinal) MRI extracted from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a separate test set of 1283 images (also from ADNI) demonstrating the ability of DaniNet to produce accurate and convincing synthetic images that emulate disease progression.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-32248-9; 978-3-030-32247-2";;2019;11766;10.1007/978-3-030-32248-9_19;S

We propose a convolutional neural network for structural segmentation based on deformation of an example mask that is disease-state agnostic, which we apply to the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the first subcortical structures affected by Alzheimer's disease, atrophying as the disease progresses. As the disease state may be unknown, and due to the varying degrees of atrophy, an accurate shape prior is not always available. The proposed network is based on an adapted spatial transformer network that learns a deformation field to resample an initial binary mask, to create an output segmentation. This segmentation is learnt by the network from the input T1-weighted MRI in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on the HarP dataset show that the network outperforms other segmentation methods and is consistent across disease states, independent of the degree of disease-related atrophy. We also explore the effect of the initial binary mask on the segmentation, showing that the it is insensitive to the size and initial location of the binary mask.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-32248-9; 978-3-030-32247-2";;2019;11766;10.1007/978-3-030-32248-9_32;S

Recent advances in deep modeling approaches trigger a new era for AD/MCI classification. However, it is still difficult to integrate multi-modal imaging data into a single deep model, to gain benefit from complementary datasets as much as possible. To address this challenge, we propose a cascaded deep model to capture both brain structural and functional characteristic for MCI classification. With diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, a graph convolution network (GCN) is constructed based on brain structural connectome and it works with a one-layer recurrent neural network (RNN) which is responsible for inferring the temporal features from brain functional activities. We named this cascaded deep model as Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (GCRNN).

In this work we propose a model for AD diagnosis based on deep feature extraction for the classification using magnetic resonance imaging. This model aims to classify AD vs. HC (Healthy Controls).

Recently, the end-to-end process of using neural networks to classify patterns has gradually replaced the tedious process of manually extracting features. The residual neural network (ResNet) can effectively avoid gradient explosion, gradient disappearance and network degradation. For AD, this paper attempts to apply ResNet to the diagnosis. Although the ResNet works better compared with the machine learning methods. However, the performance of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and Normal Control (NC) recognition is poor due to the insignificant difference in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain image features. In this paper, the selective kernel network (SKNet) and channel shuffle are introduced in the Resnet network, and an enhanced Resnet (EResNet) is proposed to accurately diagnose the AD symptoms. The method solves the influence of the multiple scales of input information on the network through SKNet, and evenly disturbs the channel feature through the channel shuffle, so that the network can fully utilize the feature information of the input image to improve the network identification capability. To evaluate the performance of the EResNet, MRI images of the brain were used to diagnosis of AD. The classification accuracy in AD / MCI and MCI / NC control groups reached 96.47% and 90.70%.

This study proposed a new classification framework based on the combination of Unet-like 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multinomial logistic regression classifier, which learns the intra-slice for multi-class classification after the selection of the 3D positron emission tomography (PET) image into a sequence of 2D slices.

At the end of the network, we used a average pooling layer before the softmax for four-class classification problem. It can efficiently generate a flexible class of transformations and that can be trained end-to-end by back propagation. The results indicated that the proposed multi-instance learning (MIL) learns region of interest (ROI) itself and thus that could help to efficiently identify the precise patterns for AD.

One of the most often used signals is electroencephalography (EEG). Different classification methods have been applied to the analysis of EEG waves with success, such as the support vec- tor machine. We apply deep learning classification to EEG signals for the detection of epilepsy using a convolutional neural network. Besides that this approach advantageously requires no feature extraction, another novelty of this ap- proach is that high classification accuracy can be achieved using only a single channel EEG.

Pena-Ortega, F;Pena-Ortega, Fernando;Brain Arrhythmias Induced by Amyloid Beta and Inflammation: Involvement in Alzheimer's Disease and Other Inflammation-related Pathologies;CURRENT ALZHEIMER RESEARCH;A variety of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD), involve amyloid beta (A beta) accumulation and/or neuroinflammation, which can alter synaptic and neural circuit functions. Consequently, these pathological conditions induce changes in neural network rhythmic activity (brain arrhythmias), which affects many brain functions. Neural network rhythms are involved in information processing, storage and retrieval, which are essential for memory consolidation, executive functioning and sensory processing. Therefore, brain arrhythmias could have catastrophic effects on circuit function, underlying the symptoms of various neurological diseases. Moreover, brain arrhythmias can serve as biomarkers for a variety of brain diseases. The aim of this review is to provide evidence linking AD and inflammation to neural network dysfunction, focusing on alterations in brain rhythms and their impact on cognition and sensory processing. I reviewed the most common brain arrhythmias characterized in AD, in AD transgenic models and those induced by A beta. In addition, I reviewed the modulations of brain rhythms in neuroinflammatory diseases and those induced by immunogens, interleukins and microglia. This review reveals that A beta and inflammation produce a complex set of effects on neural network function, which are related to the induction of brain arrhythmias and hyperexcitability, both closely related to behavioral alterations. Understanding these brain arrhythmias can help to develop therapeutic strategies to halt or prevent these neural network alterations and treat not only the arrhythmias but also the symptoms of AD and other inflammation-related pathologies.;1567-2050;1875-5828;;;2019;16;10.2174/1567205017666191213162233;J

However, classification decisions of a trained machine learning system are typically non-transparent, a major hindrance for clinical integration, error tracking or knowledge discovery. In this study, we present a transparent deep learning framework relying on 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) for diagnosing multiple sclerosis (MS), the most widespread autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease. MS is commonly diagnosed utilizing a combination of clinical presentation and conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), specifically the occurrence and presentation of white matter lesions in T2-weighted images. We hypothesized that using LRP in a naive predictive model would enable us to uncover relevant image features that a trained CNN uses for decision-making. Since imaging markers in MS are well-established this would enable us to validate the respective CNN model. First, we pre-trained a CNN on MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (n = 921), afterwards specializing the CNN to discriminate between MS patients (n = 76) and healthy controls (n = 71). Using LRP, we then produced a heatmap for each subject in the holdout set depicting the voxel-wise relevance for a particular classification decision. The resulting CNN model resulted in a balanced accuracy of 87.04% and an area under the curve of 96.08% in a receiver operating characteristic curve. The subsequent LRP visualization revealed that the CNN model focuses indeed on individual lesions, but also incorporates additional information such as lesion location, non-lesional white matter or gray matter areas such as the thalamus, which are established conventional and advanced MRI markers in MS. We conclude that LRP and the proposed framework have the capability to make diagnostic decisions of CNN models transparent, which could serve to justify classification decisions for clinical review, verify diagnosis-relevant features and potentially gather new disease knowledge.;2213-1582;;;;2019;24;10.1016/j.nicl.2019.102003;J

However, its precise role in retrieval of episodic memory is still ambiguous. In this study, we investigated the correlation of hippocampal morphometry and the performance in an autobiographical memory task in 27 healthy controls and 24 patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease (AD). Most importantly, correlations were defined separately and comparatively for memory contents with different retrieval frequency in the past. In healthy subjects, memory performance for seldom retrieved autobiographical events was significantly associated with gray matter density in the bilateral hippocampus, whereas this correlation was not present for events with high retrieval frequency. This pattern of findings confirms that retrieval frequency plays a critical role in the consolidation of episodic autobiographical memories, thereby making them more independent of the hippocampal system. In AD patients, on the other hand, successful memory retrieval appeared to be related to hippocampal morphometry irrespective of the contents' retrieval frequency, comprising events with high retrieval frequency, too. The observed differences between patients and control subjects suggest that AD-related neurodegeneration not only impairs the function, but also decreases the functional specialization of the hippocampal memory system, which, thus, may be considered as marker for AD.;1387-2877;1875-8908;;;2019;72;10.3233/JAD-190047;J

A brain network analysis by MR imaging (MR connectome) is a recently developed technique and can estimate the dysfunction of the brain network in AD and DLB. A graph theory which is a major technique of network analysis is useful for a group study to extract the feature of disorders, but is not necessarily suitable for the disorder differentiation at the individual level. In this investigation, we propose a deep learning technique as an alternative method of the graph analysis for recognition and classification of AD and DLB at the individual subject level. Materials and Methods: Forty-eight brain structural connectivity data of 18 All, 8 DLB and 22 healthy controls were applied to the machine learning consisting of a six-layer convolution neural network (CNN) model. Estimation of the deep learning model to classify AD, DLB and non-AD/DLB was performed using the 4-fold cross-validation method. Results: The accuracy, average precision and recall of our CNN model were 0.73, 0.78 and 0.73, and the specificity precision and recall were 0.68 and 0.79 in AD, 0.94 and 0.65 in DLB and 0.73 and 0.75 in non-AD/DLB. The triangular probability map of the MR connectome revealed the probability of AD, DLB and non-AD/DLB in each subject. Conclusion: Our preliminary investigation revealed the adaptation of deep learning to the MR connectome and proposed its utility in the differentiation of dementia disorders at the individual subject level.;1347-3182;1880-2206;;;2019;18;10.2463/mrms.mp.2018-0091;J

One of the prerequisites for achieving good results in the domain of an automatic diagnostics is the size and quality of the training set. One of the most serious challenges in the domain of a medical image analysis is the lack of manually annotated data. In this work, we use a relatively simple convolutional neural network to classify MRI images as either cognitively normal or those suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Based on a quantitative analysis of multiple techniques, we propose to use a specific set of data augmentation techniques to improve the generalization of the deep neural network model. The proposed approach was compared with three different approaches using the same neural network - one approach with no data augmentation, one with regularization not specific to visual data (dropout and weight decay) and one with extensive data augmentation specific for images. We conclude that by using the proposed set of augmentation techniques, including novel perturbed normalization, we postponed overfitting, which resulted in a better generalized model.;2157-8672;;978-1-7281-3227-3;;2019;;;S

The lack of sufficient data for training a deep model is a major challenge along this line of research. From our literature review, we realised that one of the current trends is using transfer learning for 2D convolutional neural networks to classify subjects with Alzheimer's disease. In this way, each 3D MRI volume is divided into 2D image slices and a pre-trained 2D convolutional neural network can be re-trained to classify image slices independently. One issue here, however, is that the 2D convolutional neural network would not be able to consider the relationship between 2D image slices in an MRI volume and make decisions on them independently. To address this issue, we propose to use a recurrent neural network after a convolutional neural network to understand the relationship between sequences of images for each subject and make a decision based on all input slices instead of each of the slices. Our results show that training the recurrent neural network on features extracted from a convolutional neural network can improve the accuracy of the whole system.;;;978-1-7281-3745-2;;2019;;;B

We developed a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm based on an optimized convolutional neural network (CNN) topology called MCADNNet that simultaneously recognizes MCI, AD, and normally aging brains in adults over the age of 75 years, using structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

The samples were shuffled and subject-level training and testing datasets were completely independent. The optimized MCADNNet was trained and extracted invariant and hierarchical features through convolutional layers followed by multi-classification in the last layer using a softmax layer. A decision-making algorithm was also designed to stabilize the outcome of the trained models. To measure the performance of classification, the accuracy rates for various pipelines were calculated before and after applying the decision-making algorithm.

Beside conventional machine learning methods, deep learning based methods have been developed in several studies, where layer-by-layer neural network settings were purposed to extract features for disease classification from the patches or whole images. However, as the disease develops from subcortical nuclei to cortical regions, specific brain regions with morphological changes might contribute to the diagnosis of disease progress. Therefore, we propose a novel spatial and depth weighted neural network structure to extract effective features, and further improve the performance of AD diagnosis. Specifically, we first use group comparison to detect the most distinctive AD-related landmarks, and then sample landmark-based image patches as our training data. In the model structure, with a 15-layer DenseNet as backbone, we introduce a attention bypass to estimate the spatial weights in the image space to guide the network to focus on specific regions. A squeeze-and-excitation (SE) mechanism is also adopted to further weight the feature map channels. We used 2335 subjects from public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2 and ADNI-GO) for experiment and results show that our framework achieves 90.02% accuracy, 81.25% sensitivity, and 96.33% specificity in diagnosis AD patients from normal controls.;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-1-5106-2548-8;;2019;10950;10.1117/12.2512645;S

By using a conditional framework, we are able to introduce side information to the model, leading to accurate reconstructions and providing a mechanism to control the generative process. Our network design provides invariance to similarity transformations and avoids the need to identify point correspondences between shapes. Contrary to previous discriminative approaches based on deep learning, our generative method does not only allow to produce shape descriptors from a point cloud, but also to reconstruct shapes from the embedding. We demonstrate the advantages of this approach by: (i) learning low-dimensional representations of the hippocampus and showing low reconstruction errors when projecting them back to the shape space, and (ii) demonstrating that synthetic point clouds generated by our model capture morphological differences associated to Alzheimer's disease, to the point that they can be used to train a discriminative model for disease classification.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-20351-1; 978-3-030-20350-4";;2019;11492;10.1007/978-3-030-20351-1_39;S

Using receiver operating characteristic curves, we show that the GCNN classifier outperforms a support vector machine classifier by margins that are reliant on disease category.

A statistical analysis based on the Wilcoxon test identifies CENT features with significant links to brain labels, which could potentially serve as diagnostic biomarkers.;2169-3536;;;;2019;7;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2930238;J

Early diagnosis will considerably decrease the risk of further deterioration. Unfortunately, current studies mainly focus on classifying the states of disease in its current stage, instead of predicting the possible development of the disease. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a special kind of recurrent neural network, which might be able to connect previous information to the present task. Noticing that the temporal data for a patient are potentially meaningful for predicting the development of the disease, we propose a predicting model based on LSTM. Therefore an LSTM network, with fully connected layer and activation layers, is built to encode the temporal relation between features and the next stage of Alzheimer's Disease. The Experiments show that our model outperforms most of the existing models.;2169-3536;;;;2019;7;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2919385;J

The dopaminergic (DA) system has been shown to be involved in amyloid-beta transformations and neuronal plasticity; however, its role in functional network changes in familial AD still remains unclear. In 5xFAD and non-transgenic freely moving mice, electroencephalograms (EEGs) were simultaneously recorded from the secondary motor cortex (MC), superficial layers of the hippocampal CA1 area (HPC), substantia nigra (SN), and ventral tegmental area (VTA). EEGs and their frequency spectra were analyzed before and after systemic injection of a DA receptor agonist, apomorphine (APO). In the baseline EEG from MC and HPC of 5xFAD mice, delta and alpha oscillations were enhanced and beta activity was attenuated, compared to control mice. In VTA and SN of 5xFAD mice, delta-theta activity was decreased and beta oscillations dominated. In control mice, APO suppressed delta activity in VTA to a higher extent than in MC, whereas in 5xFAD mice, this difference was eliminated due to attenuation of the delta suppression in VTA. APO increased beta activity in MC of mice from both groups while significant beta suppression was observed in VTA of 5xFAD mice. These mice were characterized by significant decrease of tyrosine hydroxylase immunopositive cells in both VTA and SN and of DA transporter in MC and hippocampal dentate gyrus. We suggest that the EEG modifications observed in 5xFAD mice are associated with alterations in dopaminergic transmission, resulting in adaptive changes in the cerebral networks in the course of familial AD development.";1387-2877;1875-8908;;;2019;70;10.3233/JAD-181246;J

However, collecting data from different modalities is time-consuming and expensive, and some modalities may have radioactive side effects. Our study is confined to structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). The objectives of our attempt are as follows: 1) to increase the accuracy level that is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods; 2) to overcome the overfitting problem, and; 3) to analyze proven landmarks of the brain that provide discernible features for AD diagnosis.

We combine a Hough voting method with a convolutional neural network to automatically localize brain anatomical structures such as the hippocampus. The hippocampus is one of the regions that can be affected by the Alzheimer's disease, and this region is known to be related to memory loss. The structural changes of the hippocampus are important biomarkers for dementia. To analyze the structural changes, accurate localization plays a vital role. Furthermore, for segmentation and registration of anatomical structures, exact localization is desired. Our proposed models use a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to calculate displacement vectors by exploiting the Hough voting strategy from multiple 3-viewpoint patch samples. The displacement vectors are added to the sample position to estimate the target position. To efficiently learn from samples, we employed a local and global strategy. The multiple global models were trained using randomly selected 3-viewpoint patches from the whole MRI scan. The results from global models are aggregated to obtain global predictions. Similarly, we trained multiple local models, extracting patches from the vicinity of the hippocampus location and assembling them to obtain a local prediction. The proposed models exploit the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) MRI dataset and the Gwangju Alzheimer's and related dementia (GARD) cohort MRI dataset for training, validating and testing. The average prediction error using the proposed two-stage ensemble Hough convolutional neural network (Hough-CNN) models are 2.32 and 2.25 mm for the left and right hippocampi, respectively, for 65 test MRIs from the GARD cohort dataset.

Early in AD progression, tau pathology is found in the locus coeruleus (LC) prior to amyloid-induced exacerbation of clinical symptoms. Here, a tau-seeding model in which preformed synthetic tau fibrils (K18) were unilaterally injected into the LC of P301L mice, equipped with multichannel electrodes for recording EEG in frontal cortical and CA1-CA3 hippocampal areas, was used to longitudinally quantify over 20 weeks of functional network dynamics in (1) power spectra; (2) FC using intra- and intersite phase-amplitude theta-gamma coupling (PAC); (3) coherence, partial coherence, and global coherent network efficiency (Eglob) estimates; and (4) the directionality of functional connectivity using extended partial direct coherence (PDC). A sustained leftward shift in the theta peak frequency was found early in the power spectra of hippocampal CA1 networks ipsilateral to the injection site. Strikingly, hippocampal CA1 coherence and Eglob measures were impaired in K18-treated animals. Estimation of instantaneous EEG amplitudes revealed deficiency in the propagation directionality of gamma oscillations in the CA1 circuit. Impaired PAC strength evidenced by decreased modulation of the theta frequency phase on gamma frequency amplitude further confirms impairments of the neural CA1 network. The present results demonstrate early dysfunctional hippocampal networks, despite no spreading tau pathology to the hippocampus and frontal cortex.

The recent success of deep learning in computer vision has progressed such research. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and the requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where the state-ofthe-art VGG architecture is initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images. The network is then fine-tuned with layer-wise tuning, where only a pre-defined group of layers are trained on MRI images. To shrink the training data size, we employ image entropy to select the most informative slices. Through experimentation on the ADNI dataset, we show that with the training size of 10 to 20 times smaller than the other contemporary methods, we reach the state-of-the-art performance in AD vs. NC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI vs. NC classification problems, with a 4% and a 7% increase in accuracy over the state-of-the-art for AD vs. MCI and MCI vs. NC, respectively. We also provide a detailed analysis of the effect of the intelligent training data selection method, changing the training size, and changing the number of layers to be fine-tuned.

Nevertheless, the current findings are typically obtained through statistical tests of group level differences. In clinical practice, however, it is more common to perform individual level inferences, e.g., to determine if a subject is suffering from VaD, which cannot be resolved with statistical analysis. The goal of this study is to develop a method to effectively discriminate early VaD patients from normal controls by combining EEG features with machine learning methods. The EEG signals were recorded from a total of 15 VaD patients and 21 controls during a visual oddball task. Interregional directed connectivity was derived from directed transfer function (DTF) analysis and used as features in classification. Three machine learning methods, including linear discriminant analyais (LDA), error back-propagation (BP) neural network, and support vector machine (SVM) were used as classifiers, and their classification performance was compared. It was found that VaD patients can be effectively identified using the BP and SVM classifiers with high accuracy. In particular, when the SVM classifier was combined with feature selection by Fisher score, it reached an accuracy 86.11%, sensitivity 86.67%, and specificity 85.71%. The area under the curve (AUC, 0.854) indicates a good identification of VaD patients from the normal controls. Since the EEG is noninvasive, inexpensive, and widely available to use, the current study presents a novel clinical application of machine learning methods and could facilitate automatic screening and diagnosis of the VaD at an early stage in future.;2169-3536;;;;2019;7;10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2918251;J

Methods Cognitive and F-18-florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET) data were compared in patients with NT1 aged >= 65 years (n = 23) and in age- and sex-matched controls free of clinical dementia selected from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; n = 69) and the Multi-Domain Intervention Alzheimer's Prevention Trial (MAPT-18F AV45-PET; n = 23) cohorts. The standardized uptake values (SUVs) of the cortical retention index for 6 regions of interest were computed and averaged to create a mean SUV ratio normalized to 3 subcortical reference regions (cerebellum, pons, and a composite region). A cortical/cerebellum SUV ratio >= 1.17 defined positive PET amyloid. Results Lower cortical amyloid burden was observed in the NT1 than in the ADNI and MAPT-AV45 groups (mean cortical/cerebellum SUV ratios = 0.95 +/- 0.15, 1.11 +/- 0.18 [p < 0.0001], and 1.14 +/- 0.17 [p = 0.0005], respectively). Similar results were obtained with all subcortical reference regions and for all cortical regions of interest, except cingulum. Only 1 patient with NT1 (4.4%) had positive PET amyloid compared with 27.5% in the ADNI and 30.4% in the MAPT-AV45 group. In the NT1 group, cortical or regional amyloid load was not associated with CSF orexin-A, CSF AD biomarkers, or neuropsychological profile. Interpretation Lower brain amyloid burden, assessed by F-18-florbetapir PET, in patients with NT1 suggests delayed appearance of amyloid plaques.

Eyes-closed rsEEG data were collected in 100 Nold and 120 AD subjects. eLORETA freeware estimated the source current density (SCD) and functional connectivity (lagged linear connectivity, LLC) in frontal, central, parietal, occipital, temporal, and limbic regions. Delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz), alpha 1 (8-10.5 Hz), and alpha 2 (10.5-13 Hz) were the frequency bands of interest. Univariate (i.e., single rsEEG marker with receiver operating characteristic, ROC, curve) and multivariate (i.e., multiple rsEEG markers with artificial neural networks, ANNs) classifiers were used. The best accuracy was of 76% with univariate classifiers and 77% with multiple classifiers. The present results suggest that both univariate and multivariate rsEEG classifiers allowed a moderate classification rate between Nold and AD individuals. Interestingly, the accuracy based on multiple rsEEG markers as inputs to ANNs was similar to that obtained with a single rsEEG marker, unveiling their information redundancy for classification purposes. In future AD studies, multiple rsEEG markers should also include other classes of independent linear (i.e. directed transfer function) and nonlinear (i.e. entropy) variables to improve the classification.;2195-3562;;"978-3-030-01845-0; 978-3-030-01844-3";;2019;21;10.1007/978-3-030-01845-0_196;S

Brain regions dedicated to a specific cognitive function are spatially clustered and efficiently connected each other; this is called local functional segregation. However, it is not well known that such a local segregation is associated with sub-networks which may act as building blocks of brain networks. In this work, we used machine learning techniques to analyze brain networks. Specifically, using an auto-encoder and a graph auto-encoder, we decomposed brain networks into several essential building blocks, and compared their results through various measures of decomposition quality.

As it is often the case in medical research, in contrast to typical deep learning tasks, the size of the resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Image (rs-fMRI) datasets for training is limited. Thus, the available data should be very efficiently used to learn the complex patterns underneath the brain connectivity dynamics. To address this issue, we use residual connections to alleviate the training complexity through recurrent multi-scale representation and pre-training the architecture unsupervised way. We conduct two classification tasks to differentiate early and late stage Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) from Normal healthy Control (NC) subjects. The experiments verify that our proposed residual D-net indeed learns the brain connectivity dynamics, leading to significantly higher classification accuracy compared to previously published techniques.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-36718-3; 978-3-030-36717-6";;2019;11955;10.1007/978-3-030-36718-3_51;S

However, most existing methods extract features by seed-based correlation, which not only requires prior information but also ignores the relationship between resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) voxels. In this study, we proposed a deep learning classification framework with multivariate data-driven based feature extraction for automatic diagnosis of AD. Specifically, a three-level hierarchical partner matching independent components analysis (3LHPM-ICA) approach was proposed first in order to address the issues in spatial individual ICA, including the uncertainty of the numbers of components, the randomness of initial values, and the correspondence of ICs of multiple subjects, resulting in stable and reliable ICs which were applied as the intrinsic brain functional connectivity (FC) features. Second, Granger causality (GC) was utilized to infer directional interaction between the ICs that were identified by the 3LHPM-ICA method and extract the effective connectivity features. Finally, a deep learning classification framework was developed to distinguish AD from controls by fusing the functional and effective connectivities. A resting state fMRI dataset containing 34 AD patients and 34 normal controls (NCs) was applied to the multivariate deep learning platform, leading to a classification accuracy of 95.59%, with a sensitivity of 97.06% and a specificity of 94.12% with leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV). The experimental results demonstrated that the measures of neural connectivities of ICA and GC followed by deep learning classification represented the most powerful methods of distinguishing AD clinical data from NCs, and these aberrant brain connectivities might serve as robust brain biomarkers for AD. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to classify other psychiatric disorders.;1663-4365;;;DEC 17;2018;10;10.3389/fnagi.2018.00417;J

Cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND) represents an early prodromal stage but few studies have examined brain topological changes within and between brain structural and functional networks. To this end, we studied the structural networks [diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)] and functional networks (task-free functional MRI) in CIND (61 mild, 56 moderate) and healthy older adults (97 controls). Structurally, compared with controls, moderate CIND had lower global efficiency, and lower nodal centrality and nodal efficiency in the thalamus, somatomotor network, and higher-order cognitive networks. Mild CIND only had higher nodal degree centrality in dorsal parietal regions. Functional differences were more subtle, with both CIND groups showing lower nodal centrality and efficiency in temporal and somatomotor regions. Importantly, CIND generally had higher structural-functional connectome correlation than controls. The higher structural-functional topological similarity was undesirable as higher correlation was associated with poorer verbal memory, executive function, and visuoconstruction.

While neuropathological changes pathognomonic for AD have been defined, early detection of AD prior to cognitive impairment in the clinical setting is still lacking. Pioneer studies applying machine learning to magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI) data to predict mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or AD have yielded high accuracies, however, an algorithm predicting neuropathological change is still lacking. The objective of this study was to compute a prediction model supporting a more distinct diagnostic criterium for AD compared to clinical presentation, allowing identification of hallmark changes even before symptoms occur. Methods: Autopsy verified neuropathological changes attributed to AD, as described by a combined score for 4-peptides, neurofibrillary tangles and neuritic plaques issued by the National Institute on Aging - Alzheimer's Association (NIAA), the ABC score for AD, were predicted from structural MRI data with RandomForest (RF). MRI scans were performed at least 2 years prior to death. All subjects derive from the prospective Vienna Trans-Danube Aging (VITA) study that targeted all 1750 inhabitants of the age of 75 in the starting year of 2000 in two districts of Vienna and included irregular follow-ups until death, irrespective of clinical symptoms or diagnoses. For 68 subjects MRI as well as neuropathological data were available and 49 subjects (mean age at death: 82.8 +/- 2.9, 29 female) with sufficient MRI data quality were enrolled for further statistical analysis using nested cross-validation (CV). The decoding data of the inner loop was used for variable selection and parameter optimization with a fivefold CV design, the new data of the outer loop was used for model validation with optimal settings in a fivefold CV design. The whole procedure was performed ten times and average accuracies with standard deviations were reported. Results: The most informative ROls included caudal and rostral anterior cingulate gyrus, entorhinal, fusiform and insular cortex and the subcortical ROls anterior corpus callosum and the left vessel, a ROI comprising lacunar alterations in inferior putamen and pallidum. The resulting prediction models achieved an average accuracy for a three leveled NIAA AD score of 0.62 within the decoding sets and of 0.61 for validation sets. Higher accuracies of 0.77 for both sets, respectively, were achieved when predicting presence or absence of neuropathological change. Conclusion: Computer-aided prediction of neuropathological change according to the categorical NIAA score in AD, that currently can only be assessed post-mortem, may facilitate a more distinct and definite categorization of AD dementia. Reliable detection of neuropathological hallmarks of AD would enable risk stratification at an earlier level than prediction of MCI or clinical AD symptoms and advance precision medicine in neuropsychiatry.;1663-4365;;;DEC 10;2018;10;10.3389/fnagi.2018.00406;J

In this paper, we proposed an automated structural classification method to identify MCI from healthy controls (HC) and investigated whether the classification performance was dependent on the brain parcellation schemes, including Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL-90) atlas, Brainnetome (BN-246) atlas, and AAL-1024 atlas. In detail, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data of 69 MCI patients and 63 HC matched well on gender, age, and education level were collected and analyzed with voxel-based morphometry method first, then the volume features of every region of interest (ROI) belonging to the above-mentioned three atlases were calculated and compared between MCI and HC groups, respectively. At last, the abnormal volume features were selected as the classification features for a proposed support vector machine based identification method. After the leave-one-out cross-validation to estimate the classification performance, our results reported accuracies of 83, 92, and 89% with AAL-90, BN-246, and AAL-1024 atlas, respectively, suggesting that future studies should pay more attention to the selection of brain partition schemes in the atlas-based studies.

"Li, F; Liu, M";"Li, Fan; Liu, Manhua";Alzheimer's disease diagnosis based on multiple cluster dense convolutional networks;COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL IMAGING AND GRAPHICS;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) play important role to evaluate the brain anatomical changes for AD Diagnosis. Machine learning technologies have been widely studied on MRI computation and analysis for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft features after image processing such as registration and segmentation, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a classification method based on multiple cluster dense convolutional neural networks (DenseNets) to learn the various local features of MR brain images, which are combined for AD classification. First, we partition the whole brain image into different local regions and extract a number of 3D patches from each region. Second, the patches from each region are grouped into different clusters with the K-Means clustering method. Third, we construct a DenseNet to learn the patch features for each cluster and the features learned from the discriminative clusters of each region are ensembled for classification. Finally, the classification results from different local regions are combined to enhance final image classification. The proposed method can gradually learn the MRI features from the local patches to global image level for the classification task. There are no rigid registration and segmentation required for preprocessing MRI images. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted MRIs of 831 subjects including 199 AD patients, 403 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 229 normal control (NC) subjects from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 89.5% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.4% for AD vs. NC classification, and an accuracy of 73.8% and an AUC of 77.5% for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the promising classification performances.

Because they may be associated with several brain diseases, it is important that they are detected as soon as possible. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides three-dimensional data with the possibility to detect and emphasize contrast differences in soft tissues, providing rich information about the human soft tissue anatomy. However, the amount of data provided for these images is far too much for manual analysis/interpretation, representing a difficult and time-consuming task for specialists. This work presents a computational methodology capable of detecting regions of white matter lesions of the brain in MRI of FLAIR modality. The techniques highlighted in this methodology are SLICO clustering for candidate segmentation and convolutional neural networks for candidate classification. Methods: The methodology proposed here consists of four steps: (1) images acquisition, (2) images pre-processing, (3) candidates segmentation and (4) candidates classification. Results: The methodology was applied on 91 magnetic resonance images provided by DASA, and achieved an accuracy of 98.73%, specificity of 98.77% and sensitivity of 78.79% with 0.005 of false positives, without any false positives reduction technique, in detection of white matter lesion regions.

Influenced by voxel-wise and other univariate comparisons, where these corrections are key, they are commonly applied to any type of analysis and imaging modalities. Nuclear imaging modalities such as PET-FDG or FP-CIT SPECT, a common modality used in Parkinson's disease diagnosis, are especially dependent on intensity normalization. However, these steps are computationally expensive and furthermore, they may introduce deformations in the images, altering the information contained in them. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), for their part, introduce position invariance to pattern recognition, and have been proven to classify objects regardless of their orientation, size, angle, etc. Therefore, a question arises: how well can CNNs account for spatial and intensity differences when analyzing nuclear brain imaging? Are spatial and intensity normalizations still needed? To answer this question, we have trained four different CNN models based on well-established architectures, using or not different spatial and intensity normalization preprocessings. The results show that a sufficiently complex model such as our three-dimensional version of the ALEXNET can effectively account for spatial differences, achieving a diagnosis accuracy of 94.1% with an area under the ROC curve of 0.984. The visualization of the differences via saliency maps shows that these models are correctly finding patterns that match those found in the literature, without the need of applying any complex spatial normalization procedure. However, the intensity normalization and its type - is revealed as very influential in the results and accuracy of the trained model, and therefore must be well accounted.;0129-0657;1793-6462;;DEC;2018;28;10.1142/S0129065718500351;J

Three-dimensional tumor tensors were constructed and used as input for the KSTM-based classifier. A KSTM iterative algorithm with a convergent proof was developed to train the weight vectors for every mode of the tensor for the classifier. In contrast to conventional radiomics approaches that rely on handcrafted imaging features, the KSTM-based classifier uses 3D imaging as input, taking full advantage of the imaging information. The KSTM-based classifier preserves the intrinsic 3D geometry structure of the medical images and the correlation in the original images and trains the classification hyper-plane in an adaptive feature tensor space.

In this study, a deep learning approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNN), is designed to accurately predict MCI-to-AD conversion with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. First, MRI images are prepared with age-correction and other processing. Second, local patches, which are assembled into 2.5 dimensions, are extracted from these images. Then, the patches from AD and normal controls (NC) are used to train a CNN to identify deep learning features of MCI subjects.

We describe existing, multi-modal imaging techniques of the brain's soft tissue and describe in detail how are the resulting images are analyzed by a radiologist to form a diagnosis. Several comparisons between the best results of classifying natural scenes and medical image analysis illustrate the challenges of applying existing image processing techniques to the medical image analysis domain. The survey of medical image processing methods also identified several knowledge gaps, the need for automation of image processing analysis, and the identification of the brain structures in the medical images that differentiate healthy tissue from a pathology. This survey is grounded in the cases of brain tumor analysis and the traumatic brain injury diagnoses, as these two case studies illustrate the vastly different approaches needed to define, extract, and synthesize meaningful information from multiple MRI image sets for a diagnosis. Finally, the article summarizes artificial intelligence frameworks that are built as multi-stage, hybrid, hierarchical information processing work-flows and the bene fits of applying these models for medical diagnosis to build intelligent physician's aids with knowledge transparency, expert knowledge embedding, and increased analytical quality.;2296-9144;;;NOV 2;2018;5;10.3389/frobt.2018.00120;J

Previous studies for hippocampus segmentation require either human annotation which is tedious and error-prone or pre-processing MR images via time-consuming non-linear registration. Although many automatic segmentation approaches have been proposed, their performance is often limited by the small size of hippocampus and complex confounding information around the hippocampus. In particular, human-engineered features extracted from segmented hippocampus regions (e.g., the volume of the hippocampus) are essential for brain disease diagnosis, while these features are independent of diagnosis models, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task deep learning (MDL) method for joint hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression using MR images. The prominent advantages of our MDL method lie on that we don't need any time-consuming non-linear registration for pre-processing MR images, and features generated by MDL are consistent with subsequent diagnosis models. Specifically, we first align all MR images onto a standard template, followed by a patch extraction process to approximately locate hippocampus regions in the template space. Using image patches as input data, we develop a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression. The proposed CNN network contains two subnetworks, including 1) a U-Net with a Dice-like loss function for hippocampus segmentation, and 2) a convolutional neural network with a mean squared loss function for clinical regression. Note that these two subnetworks share a part of network parameters, to exploit the inherent association between these two tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on 407 subjects with MRI data from baseline Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results suggest that our MDL method achieves promising results in both tasks of hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression, compared with several state-of-the-art methods.;1380-7501;1573-7721;;NOV;2018;77;10.1007/s11042-017-5581-1;J

We included 248 subjects with SCD (61 +/- 9 years, 42% female, Mini-Mental State Examination = 28 +/- 2) from the SCIENCe project and Amsterdam Dementia Cohort. Subjects were dichotomized as amyloid abnormal by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET). Baseline plasma Abeta40, Abeta42, and tTau were measured using Simoa technology. Associations between plasma levels and amyloid status were assessed using logistic regression analyses and receiver operating characteristic analyses. Association of plasma levels with risk of clinical progression to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia was assessed using Cox proportional hazard models. Results Interpretation Fifty-seven (23%) subjects were CSF-amyloid abnormal. Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and plasma Abeta42 alone, but not tTau, identified abnormal CSF-amyloid status (plasma ratio: area under the curve [AUC] = 77%, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 69-84%; plasma Abeta42: AUC = 66%, 95% CI: 58-74%). Combining plasma ratio with age and apolipoprotein E resulted in AUC = 83% (95% CI = 77-89%). The Youden cutoff of the plasma ratio gave a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 75%, and applying this as a prescreener would reduce the number of lumbar punctures by 51%. Using PET as outcome, a comparable reduction in number of PET scans would be achieved when applying the plasma ratio as prescreener. In addition, low plasma ratio was associated with clinical progression to MCI or dementia (hazard ratio = 2.0, 95% CI = 1.4-2.3). Plasma Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio has potential as a prescreener to identify Alzheimer pathological changes in cognitively normal individuals with SCD.

We wanted to quantify early cerebrovascular health-related magnetic resonance imaging brain measures (structure, perfusion, microstructural integrity) and evaluate their utility as a biomarker for cerebrovascular health. We used 2 independent samples (discovery, n = 390; validation, n = 1,035) of individuals, aged >= 60 years, along the cognitive continuum with imaging from the population-based sample of Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We ascertained vascular health by summing up recently existing cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC) from health care records (hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, and stroke). Using multiple regression models, we quantified associations between CMC and brain health after accounting for age, sex, education/occupation, and AD burden (from amyloid and tau PET). Results Interpretation Systemic vascular health was associated with medial temporal lobe thinning, widespread cerebral hypoperfusion, and loss of microstructural integrity in several white matter tracts including the corpus callosum and fornix. Further investigations suggested that microstructural integrity of the genu of the corpus callosum was suitable for assessing prodromal cerebrovascular health, had similar distributions in the discovery and independent validation datasets, and predicted cognitive performance above and beyond amyloid deposition. Systemic vascular health has significant impact on brain structure and function. Quantifying prodromal cerebrovascular health-related brain measures that are independent of AD pathology-related changes has great utility for cognitive aging.

We conducted a meta-analysis with individual participant data from 1,251 patients diagnosed with PPA (including logopenic [lvPPA, n = 443], nonfluent [nfvPPA, n = 333], semantic [svPPA, n = 401], and mixed/unclassifiable [n = 74] variants of PPA) from 36 centers, with a measure of amyloid-beta pathology (CSF [n = 600], PET [n = 366], and/or autopsy [n = 378]) available. The estimated prevalence of amyloid positivity according to PPA variant, age, and apolipoprotein E (ApoE) epsilon 4 status was determined using generalized estimating equation models. Results Interpretation Amyloid-beta positivity was more prevalent in lvPPA (86%) than in nfvPPA (20%) or svPPA (16%; p < 0.001). Prevalence of amyloid-beta positivity increased with age in nfvPPA (from 10% at age 50 years to 27% at age 80 years, p < 0.01) and svPPA (from 6% at age 50 years to 32% at age 80 years, p < 0.001), but not in lvPPA (p = 0.94). Across PPA variants, ApoE epsilon 4 carriers were more often amyloid-beta positive (58.0%) than noncarriers (35.0%, p < 0.001). Autopsy data revealed Alzheimer disease pathology as the most common pathologic diagnosis in lvPPA (76%), frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43 in svPPA (80%), and frontotemporal lobar degeneration-TDP-43/tau in nfvPPA (64%). This study shows that the current PPA classification system helps to predict underlying pathology across different cohorts and clinical settings, and suggests that age and ApoE genotype should be considered when interpreting amyloid-beta biomarkers in PPA patients.

Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. New method: The performances of five different classification approaches using five different attribute rankings each followed with an adaptive Fisher stopping criteria feature selection (FS) method are evaluated. To improve the performance of PD detection, a source fusion technique which combines the gray matter (GM) and white (WM) tissue maps and a decision fusion technique which combines the outputs of all classifiers using the correlation-based feature selection (CFS) method by majority voting are used. Results: Among the five FS methods, the CFS provides the highest results for all five classification algorithms and the SVM provides the best classification performances for all five different FS methods. The classification accuracy of 77.50% and 81.25% are obtained for the GM and WM tissues, respectively. However, the fusion of GM and WM datasets improves the classification accuracy of the proposed methodology up to 95.00%. Comparison with Existing Methods: An f-contrast is used to generate 3D masks for GM and WM datasets and a fusion technique, combining the GM and WM datasets is used. Several classification algorithms using several FS methods are performed and a decision fusion technique is used. Conclusions: Using the combination of the 3D masked GM and WM tissue maps and the fusion of the outputs of multiple classifiers with CFS method gives the classification accuracy of 95.00%.;0165-0270;1872-678X;;NOV 1;2018;309;10.1016/j.jneumeth.2018.08.017;J

These components are alternately applied, and each CNN is trained to minimize the loss between the reconstructed and corresponding fully sampled k-spaces. The final reconstructed image is obtained by forward-propagating the undersampled k-space data through the entire network. Results: Performances of K-net (KCNN with inverse Fourier transform), I-net (ICNN with interleaved data consistency), and various combinations of the 2 different networks were tested. The test results indicated that K-net and I-net have different advantages/disadvantages in terms of tissue-structure restoration. Consequently, the combination of K-net and I-net is superior to single-domain CNNs. Three MR data sets, the T-2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (T-2 FLAIR) set from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and 2 data sets acquired at our local institute (T-2 FLAIR and T-1 weighted), were used to evaluate the performance of 7 conventional reconstruction algorithms and the proposed cross-domain CNNs, which hereafter is referred to as KIKI-net. KIKI-net outperforms conventional algorithms with mean improvements of 2.29 dB in peak SNR and 0.031 in structure similarity.

The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a non-invasive neurophysiological test that has promise as a biomarker sensitive to treatment effects. The aim of our study was to investigate a novel non-linear index of resting state EEG activity as a predictor of clinical outcome, and compare its predictive capacity to traditional frequency-based indices. Methods: EEG was recorded from 62 patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and 25 healthy comparison (HC) subjects. TRD patients were treated with excitatory repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) for 4 to 6 weeks. EEG signals were first decomposed using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method into band-limited intrinsic mode functions (IMFs). Subsequently, Permutation Entropy (PE) was computed from the obtained second IMF to yield an index named PEIMF2. Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and ANOVA test were used to evaluate the efficiency of this index (PEIMF2) and were compared to frequency-band based methods. Results: Responders (RP) to rTMS exhibited an increase in the PEIMF2 index compared to non-responders (NR) at F3, FCz and FC3 sites (p < 0.01). The area under the curve (AUC) for ROC analysis was 0.8 for PEIMF2 index for the FC3 electrode. The PEIMF2 index was superior to ordinary frequency band measures.

However, it remains largely unclear whether spontaneous brain activity is effectively related to EO and EC resting states. The amplitude, local functional concordance, inter-hemisphere functional synchronization, and network centrality of spontaneous brain activity were measured by the fraction amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (fALFF), regional homogeneity (ReHo), voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) and degree centrality (DC), respectively. Using the public Eyes-open/Eyes-closed dataset, we employed the support vector machine (SVM) and bootstrap technique to establish linking models for the fALFF, ReHo, VMHC and DC dimensions. The classification accuracies of linking models are 0.72 (0.59, 0.82), 0.88 (0.79, 0.97), 0.82 (0.74, 0.91) and 0.70 (0.62, 0.79), respectively. Specifically, we observed that brain activity in the EO condition is significantly greater in attentional system areas, including the fusiform gyrus, occipital and parietal cortex, but significantly lower in sensorimotor system areas, including the precentral/postcentral gyrus, paracentral lobule (PCL) and temporal cortex compared to the EC condition from the four dimensions. The results consistently indicated that spontaneous brain activity is effectively related to EO and EC resting states, and the two resting states are of opposite brain activity in sensorimotor and occipital regions. It may provide new insight into the neural substrate of the resting state and help computational neuroscientists or neuropsychologists to choose an appropriate resting state condition to investigate various mental disorders from the resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique.;1662-5161;;;OCT 18;2018;12;10.3389/fnhum.2018.00422;J
Blamire, AM;Blamire, Andrew M.;MR approaches in neurodegenerative disorders;PROGRESS IN NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY;Neurodegenerative disease is the umbrella term which refers to a range of clinical conditions causing degeneration of neurons within the central nervous system leading to loss of brain function and eventual death. The most prevalent of these is Alzheimer's disease (AD), which affects approximately 50 million people worldwide and is predicted to reach 75 million by 2030. Neurodegenerative diseases can only be fully diagnosed at post mortem by neuropathological assessment of the type and distribution of protein deposits which characterise each different condition, but there is a clear role for imaging technologies in aiding patient diagnoses in life. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) techniques have been applied to study these conditions for many years. In this review, we consider the range of MR-based measurements and describe the findings in AD, but also contrast these with the second most common dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The most definitive observation is the major structural brain changes seen in AD using conventional T1-weighted (T1w) MRI, where medial temporal lobe structures are notably atrophied in most symptomatic patients with AD, but often preserved in DLB. Indeed these findings are sufficiently robust to have been incorporated into clinical diagnostic criteria. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) reveals widespread changes in tissue microstructure, with increased mean diffusivity and decreased fractional anisotropy reflecting the degeneration of the white matter structures. There are suggestions that there are subtle differences between AD and DLB populations. At the metabolic level, atrophy-corrected MRS demonstrates reduced density of healthy neurons in brain areas with altered perfusion and in regions known to show higher deposits of pathogenic proteins. As studies have moved from patients with advanced disease and clear dysfunction to patients with earlier presentation such as with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which in some represents the first signs of their ensuing dementia, the ability of MRI to detect differences has been weaker and further work is still required, ideally in much larger cohorts than previously studied. The vast majority of imaging research in dementia populations has been univariate with respect to the MR-derived parameters considered. To date, none of these measurements has uniquely replicated the patterns of tissue involvement seen by neuropathology, and the ability of MR techniques to deliver a non-invasive diagnosis eludes us. Future opportunities may lie in combining MR and nuclear medicine approaches (position emission tomography, PET) to provide a more complete view of structural and metabolic changes. Such developments will require multi-variate analyses, possibly combined with artificial intelligence or deep learning algorithms, to enhance our ability to combine the array of image derived information, genetic, gender and lifestyle factors.

AD research as utilized with clinical and computer aid diagnostic tools has been strongly developed in recent decades. Several studies have resulted in many methods of early detection of AD, which benefit patient outcomes and new findings on the development of a deeper understanding of the mechanisms of this disease. Therefore, using the operation of electronic computers to diagnose automatically the incident of AD has served a vital role in supporting clinicians as well as easing significant elaboration on manual and subjectively AD diagnosing of clinicians for the patient's beneficial outcomes. To this end, we propose a deep learning approach-based model of AD detection applying to MRI and PET images. Individually, we extract non-white matter of brain PET images, which are guided by MRI images as an anatomical mask. Before running the classification module, we build an unsupervised network entitled the high-level layer concatenation autoencoder to pre-train the network with inputs as three-dimensional patches extracted from pre-processed scans. The learned parameters are reused for a well-known convolutional neural network to boost up the training procedure. We conduct experiments on a public data set ADNI and classified a subject into one of three groups: normal control, mild cognitive impairment, and AD.

In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and theta bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, theta, alpha, and beta).

Structural and functional neuroimages, such as magnetic resonance images (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), are providing powerful imaging modalities to help understand the anatomical and functional neural changes related to AD. In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely studied on analysis of multi-modality neuroimages for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft imaging features after image preprocessing such as registration and segmentation, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD subjects from other groups. This paper proposes to construct cascaded convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the multi-level and multimodal features of MRI and PET brain images for AD classification. First, multiple deep 3D-CNNs are constructed on different local image patches to transform the local brain image into more compact high-level features. Then, an upper high-level 2D-CNN followed by softmax layer is cascaded to ensemble the high-level features learned from the multi-modality and generate the latent multimodal correlation features of the corresponding image patches for classification task. Finally, these learned features are combined by a fully connected layer followed by softmax layer for AD classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic multi-level and multimodal features from multiple imaging modalities for classification, which are robust to the scale and rotation variations to some extent. No image segmentation and rigid registration are required in pre-processing the brain images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline MRI and PET images of 397 subjects including 93 AD patients, 204 mild cognitive impairment (MCI, 76 pMCI +128 sMCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 93.26% for classification of AD vs. NC and 82.95% for classification pMCI vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance.;1539-2791;1559-0089;;OCT;2018;16;10.1007/s12021-018-9370-4;J

In recent years, some researchers have tried to apply neural network (NN) to classify AD patients from healthy controls (HC) based on functional MRI (fMRI) data. But most study focus on a single NN and the classification accuracy was not high. Therefore, this paper used the random neural network cluster which was composed of multiple NNs to improve classification performance. Sixty one subjects (25 AD and 36 HC) were acquired from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. This method not only could be used in the classification, but also could be used for feature selection. Firstly, we chose Elman NN from five types of NNs as the optimal base classifier of random neural network cluster based on the results of feature selection, and the accuracies of the random Elman neural network cluster could reach to 92.31% which was the highest and stable. Then we used the random Elman neural network cluster to select significant features and these features could be used to find out the abnormal regions. Finally, we found out 23 abnormal regions such as the precentral gyrus, the frontal gyrus and supplementary motor area. These results fully show that the random neural network cluster is worthwhile and meaningful for the diagnosis of AD.;1662-5196;;;SEP 7;2018;12;10.3389/fninf.2018.00060;J

In this study, we applied deep neural networks to generate individually adaptive PET templates for robust and accurate SN of amyloid PET without using matched 3D MR images. Using 681 pairs of simultaneously acquired C-11-PIB PET and T1-weighted 3D MRI scans of AD, MCI, and cognitively normal subjects, we trained and tested two deep neural networks [convolutional auto-encoder (CAE) and generative adversarial network (GAN)] that produce adaptive best PET templates. More specifically, the networks were trained using 685,100 pieces of augmented data generated by rotating 527 randomly selected datasets and validated using 154 datasets. The input to the supervised neural networks was the 3D PET volume in native space and the label was the spatially normalized 3D PET image using the transformation parameters obtained from MRI-based SN. The proposed deep learning approach significantly enhanced the quantitative accuracy of MRI-less amyloid PET assessment by reducing the SN error observed when an average amyloid PET template is used. Given an input image, the trained deep neural networks rapidly provide individually adaptive 3D PET templates without any discontinuity between the slices (in 0.02 s). As the proposed method does not require 3D MRI for the SN of PET images, it has great potential for use in routine analysis of amyloid PET images in clinical practice and research.;1065-9471;1097-0193;;SEP;2018;39;10.1002/hbm.24210;J

However, these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest defined by experts. Also, because of possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a landmark-based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the minimal interval resonance imaging in alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) dataset.

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that CR helps maintain performance in the face of pathology across multiple cognitive domains. We therefore tried to identify a single, task-invariant CR network that is active during the performance of many disparate tasks. In imaging data acquired from 255 individuals age 20-80 while performing 12 different cognitive tasks, we used an iterative approach to derive a multivariate network that was expressed during the performance of all tasks, and whose degree of expression correlated with IQ, a proxy for CR. When applied to held out data or forward applied to fMRI data from an entirely different activation task, network expression correlated with IQ. Expression of the CR pattern accounted for additional variance in fluid reasoning performance over and above the influence of cortical thickness, and also moderated between cortical thickness and reasoning performance, consistent with the behavior of a CR network. The identification of a task-invariant CR network supports the idea that life experiences may result in brain processing differences that might provide reserve against age- or disease-related changes across multiple tasks.;1053-8119;1095-9572;;SEP;2018;178;10.1016/j.neuroimage.2018.05.033;J

Individual prognosis is complicated by many factors including the definition of the prediction objective itself. In this work, we present a computational framework comprising machine-learning techniques for 1) modeling symptom trajectories and 2) prediction of symptom trajectories using multimodal and longitudinal data. We perform primary analyses on three cohorts from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and a replication analysis using subjects from Australian Imaging, Biomarker & Lifestyle Flagship Study of Ageing (AIBL). We model the prototypical symptom trajectory classes using clinical assessment scores from mini-mental state exam (MMSE) and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale (ADAS-13) at nine timepoints spanned over six years based on a hierarchical clustering approach. Subsequently we predict these trajectory classes for a given subject using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, genetic, and clinical variables from two timepoints (baseline + follow-up). For prediction, we present a longitudinal Siamese neural-network (LSN) with novel architectural modules for combining multimodal data from two timepoints. The trajectory modeling yields two (stable and decline) and three (stable, slow-decline, fast-decline) trajectory classes for MMSE and ADAS-13 assessments, respectively. For the predictive tasks, LSN offers highly accurate performance with 0.900 accuracy and 0.968 AUC for binary MMSE task and 0.760 accuracy for 3-way ADAS-13 task on ADNI datasets, as well as, 0.724 accuracy and 0.883 AUC for binary MMSE task on replication AIBL dataset.;1553-734X;1553-7358;;SEP;2018;14;10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006376;J

Diverse lines of evidence suggest that neuronal accumulation of tau promotes network dysfunction and cognitive decline. The A152T-variant of human tau (hTau-A152T) increases the risk of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and several other tauopathies. When overexpressed in neurons of transgenic mice, it causes age-dependent neuronal loss and cognitive decline, as well as non-convulsive epileptic activity, which is also seen in patients with AD. Using intracranial EEG recordings with electrodes implanted over the parietal cortex, we demonstrate that hTau-A152T increases the power of brain oscillations in the 0.5-6 Hz range more than wildtype human tau in transgenic lines with comparable levels of human tau protein in brain, and that genetic ablation of endogenous tau in Mapt(-/-) mice decreases the power of these oscillations as compared to wildtype controls. Suppression of hTau-A152T production in doxycycline-regulatable transgenic mice reversed their abnormal network activity. Treatment of hTau-A152T mice with the antiepileptic drug levetiracetam also rapidly and persistently reversed their brain dysrhythmia and network hypersynchrony. These findings suggest that both the level and the sequence of tau modulate the power of specific brain oscillations. The potential of EEG spectral changes as a biomarker deserves to be explored in clinical trials of tau-lowering therapeutics. Our results also suggest that levetiracetam treatment is able to counteract tau-dependent neural network dysfunction.

Alteration in brain functional connectivity (FC) is expected to provide potential biomarkers for classifying or predicting brain disorders. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review in order to provide guidance about the available brain FC measures and typical classification strategies. We survey the state-of-the-art FC analysis methods including widely used static functional connectivity (SFC) and more recently proposed dynamic functional connectivity (DFC). Temporal correlations among regions of interest (ROIs), data-driven spatial network and functional network connectivity (FNC) are often computed to reflect SFC from different angles. SFC can be extended to DFC using a sliding-window framework, and intrinsic connectivity states along the time-varying connectivity patterns are typically extracted using clustering or decomposition approaches. We also briefly summarize window-less DFC approaches. Subsequently, we highlight various strategies for feature selection including the filter, wrapper and embedded methods. In terms of model building, we include traditional classifiers as well as more recently applied deep learningmethods. Moreover, we review representative applications with remarkable classification accuracy for psychosis and mood disorders, neurodevelopmental disorder, and neurological disorders using fMRI data.

However, studies directly comparing neural tDCS effects between young and older adults are scarce and limited to task-related imaging paradigms. Resting-state (rs-) fMRI, that is independent of age-related differences in performance, is well suited to investigate age-associated differential neural tDCS effects. Three online tDCS conditions (anodal, cathodal, sham) were compared in a cross-over, within-subject design, in 30 young and 30 older adults. Active stimulation targeted the left sensorimotor network (active electrode over left sensorimotor cortex with right supraorbital reference electrode). A graph-based rs-fMRI data analysis approach (eigenvector centrality mapping) and complementary seed-based analyses characterized neural tDCS effects. An interaction between anodal tDCS and age group was observed. Specifically, centrality in bilateral paracentral and posterior regions (precuneus, superior parietal cortex) was increased in young, but decreased in older adults. Seed-based analyses revealed that these opposing patterns of tDCS-induced centrality modulation originated from differential effects of tDCS on functional coupling of the stimulated left paracentral lobule. Cathodal tDCS did not show significant effects. Our study provides first evidence for differential tDCS effects on neural network organization in young and older adults.

Methods145 aMCI subjects were divided into two sub-groups and, according to the clinical follow-up, were classified as Converted to AD (C-MCI, 71) or Stable (S-MCI, 74). ResultsResults showed significant differences in SW in delta, alpha1, alpha2, beta2, gamma bands, with C-MCI in the baseline similar to AD.

Here, we use a neural network (NN) framework on both magnetic resonance imaging-derived quantitative structural brain measures and genetic data to address this question. We tested the effectiveness of NN models in classifying and predicting AD. We further performed a novel analysis of the NN model to gain insight into the most predictive imaging and genetics features and to identify possible interactions between features that affect AD risk. Data were obtained from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative cohort and included baseline structural MRI data and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data for 138 AD patients, 225 CN subjects, and 358 MCI patients. We found that NN models with both brain and SNP features as predictors perform significantly better than models with either alone in classifying AD and CN subjects, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.992, and in predicting the progression from MCI to AD (AUC = 0.835). The most important predictors in the NN model were the left middle temporal gyrus volume, the left hippocampus volume, the right entorhinal cortex volume, and the APOE (a gene that encodes apolipoprotein E) epsilon 4 risk allele. Furthermore, we identified interactions between the right parahippocampal gyrus and the right lateral occipital gyrus, the right banks of the superior temporal sulcus and the left posterior cingulate, and SNP rs10838725 and the left lateral occipital gyrus.

Modeling tfMRI data is challenging due to at least two problems: the lack of the ground truth of underlying neural activity and the highly complex intrinsic structure of tfMRI data. To better understand brain networks based on fMRI data, data-driven approaches have been proposed, for instance, independent component analysis (ICA) and sparse dictionary learning (SDL). However, both ICA and SDL only build shallow models, and they are under the strong assumption that original fMRI signal could be linearly decomposed into time series components with their corresponding spatial maps. As growing evidence shows that human brain function is hierarchically organized, new approaches that can infer and model the hierarchical structure of brain networks are widely called for. Recently, deep convolutional neural network (CNN) has drawn much attention, in that deep CNN has proven to be a powerful method for learning high-level andmid-level abstractions from low-level raw data. Inspired by the power of deep CNN, in this paper, we developed a new neural network structure based on CNN, called deep convolutional auto-encoder (DCAE), in order to take the advantages of both data-driven approach and CNN's hierarchical feature abstraction ability for the purpose of learning mid-level and high-level features from complex, large-scale tfMRI time series in an unsupervised manner.

However, in the clinical setting, not all the subjects have corresponding MR images. Here, we developed a model to generate structural MR images from amyloid PET using deep generative networks. We applied our model to quantification of cortical amyloid load without structural MR. Methods: We used florbetapir PET and structural MR data from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. The generative network was trained to generate realistic structural MR images from florbetapir PET images. After the training, the model was applied to the quantification of cortical amyloid load. PET images were spatially normalized to the template space using the generated MR, and then SUV ratio (SUVR) of the target regions was measured by predefined regions of interest. A real MR-based quantification was used as the gold standard to measure the accuracy of our approach. Other MR-less methods-a normal PET template-based, a multiatlas PET template-based, and a PET segmentation-based normalization/quantification-were also tested. We compared the performance of quantification methods using generated MR with that of MR-based and MR-less quantification methods. Results: Generated MR images from florbetapir PET showed signal patterns that were visually similar to the real MR. The structural similarity index between real and generated MR was 0.91 +/- 0.04. The mean absolute error of SUVR of cortical composite regions estimated by the generated MR-based method was 0.04 +/- 0.03, which was significantly smaller than other MR-less methods (0.29 +/- 0.12 for the normal PET template, 0.12 +/- 0.07 for the multiatlas PET template, and 0.08 +/- 0.06 for the PET segmentation-based methods). Bland-Altman plots revealed that the generated MR-based SUVR quantification was the closest to the SUVRs estimated by the real MR-based method. Conclusion: Structural MR images were successfully generated from amyloid PET images using deep generative networks. Generated MR images could be used as templates for accurate and precise amyloid quantification. This generative method might be used to generate multimodal images of various organs for further quantitative analyses.;0161-5505;1535-5667;;JUL 1;2018;59;10.2967/jnumed.117.199414;J

Frontotemporal dementias (FTDs) are neurodegenerative brain conditions, primarily affecting the frontal and/or temporal lobe. Three main phenotypes are recognized, each with a distinct clinical and cognitive profile: behavioral-variant FTD (bvFTD), semantic dementia (SD), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA). The severity of cerebellar changes and their relation to cognition in FTD, however, remain unclear. This study aimed to establish cerebellar gray matter changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and their relation to profiles of cognitive deficits in FTD subtypes. MethodsNinety-six FTD patients (45 bvFTD, 28 SD, and 23 PNFA), meeting current clinical diagnostic criteria, and 35 age-, sex-, and education-matched controls underwent brain MRI and cognitive assessment. Cerebral and cerebellar gray matter integrity were investigated using voxel-based morphometry. ResultsCompared with controls, widespread bilateral cerebellar changes were observed in all FTD subtypes, with the greatest atrophy present in bvFTD. Significant associations were found between cerebellar integrity and cognitive performance in attention and working memory in bvFTD, visuospatial function in SD, and language-motor function in PNFA. Bilateral atrophy of crus and lobule VI were most commonly associated with cognitive deficits, irrespective of FTD phenotype. InterpretationThis study is the first to identify distinct patterns of cerebellar atrophy across FTD syndromes, which in turn relate to discrete cognitive dysfunctions, after accounting for the effect of cerebral atrophy. These findings extend our understanding of the cerebellum and point to its involvement across an array of processes beyond the domain of motor function.

Also, Alzheimer's disease, one of the five most severe non-communicable diseases all around the world, receives much attention in both academic research and clinical diagnosis for the time being. It is generally acknowledged that magnetic resonance imaging, a popular imaging tool because of its free of radiation exposure in terms of patients safety issues, has been vastly employed in Alzheimer's disease diagnosis in recent years. However, most contemporary clinical diagnosis efforts still heavily rely on clinicians' expertise to realize the disease diagnosis task. In this study, inspired by the recent rapid development of deep learning and low-resource learning techniques, a novel image-based disease diagnosis scheme is proposed to automatically fulfil the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease based on arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance images. This new end-to-end low-resource learning scheme is conducted following four steps. First, raw arterial spin labeling images need to be acquired and essential pre-processing steps should be carried out on raw images. Second, the popular convolutional neural network technique is adopted to automatically extract latent trainable features from processed arterial spin labelling images, instead of traditional hand-crafted features. Third, a novel low-resource pair-wise learning method inspired by the semi-supervised learning theory is carried out based on latent trainable features for automatically determining disease similarity functions. Forth, learned outcomes are then fed into a multi-nominal logistic regression model and a regression process with the highest posterior probability is capable to reveal the corresponding disease diagnosis outcome. Extensive experiments based on a database composed of magnetic resonance images acquired from 350 real demented patients are carried out with the newly poroposed scheme being compared towards several other well-known diagnosis tools. All diagnosis results have undergone rigorous and comprehensive statistical analysis composed of analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests. The superiority of the new scheme has been demonstrated therein.;1380-7501;1573-7721;;JUL;2018;77;10.1007/s11042-017-4492-5;J

To investigate their potential as electrophysiological markers of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), we recorded beta EEG activity during resting and during an omitted tone task in patients and healthy elderly. Thirty participants were enrolled (15 patients, 15 healthy controls). In particular, we investigated event-related spectral perturbation and intertrial coherence indices. Analyses showed that (a) healthy elderly presented greater beta power at rest than patients with aMCI patients; (b) during the task, healthy elderly were more accurate than aMCI patients and presented greater beta power than aMCI patients; (c) both groups showed qualitatively similar spectral perturbation responses during the task, but different spatiotemporal response patterns; and (d) aMCI patients presented greater beta phase locking than healthy elderly during the task. Results indicate that beta activity in healthy elderly differs from that of patients with aMCI. Furthermore, the analysis of task-related EEG activity extends evidences obtained during resting and suggests that during the prodromal phase of Alzheimer's disease there is a reduced efficiency in information exchange by large-scale neural networks.

"Liu, MH; Cheng, DN; Yan, WW";"Liu, Manhua; Cheng, Danni; Yan, Weiwu";Classification of Alzheimer's Disease by Combination of Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks Using FDG-PET Images;FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS;Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible brain degenerative disorder affecting people aged older than 65 years. Currently, there is no effective cure for AD, but its progression can be delayed with some treatments. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future treatment. Fluorodeoxyglucose positrons emission tomography (FDG-PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be powerful to help understand the anatomical and neural changes of brain related to AD. Most existing methods extract the handcrafted features from images, and then design a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. These methods highly depends on the preprocessing of brain images, including image rigid registration and segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which learns the intra-slice and inter-slice features for classification after decomposition of the 3D PET image into a sequence of 2D slices. The 2D CNNs are built to capture the features of image slices while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is cascaded to learn and integrate the inter-slice features for image classification. No rigid registration and segmentation are required for PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline FDG-PET images acquired from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 95.3% for AD vs. NC classification and 83.9% for MCI vs. NC classification, demonstrating the promising classification performance.;;1662-5196;;JUN 19;2018;12;10.3389/fninf.2018.00035;J

We have previously shown increased [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral gyrus in a small group of ALS patients. Herein, we confirm our initial finding, study the longitudinal changes, and characterize the gray versus white matter distribution of [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in a larger cohort of patients with ALS and PLS. MethodsEighty-five participants including 53 with ALS, 11 with PLS, and 21 healthy controls underwent integrated [C-11]-PBR28 PET-magnetic resonance brain imaging. Patients were clinically assessed using the Upper Motor Neuron Burden (UMNB) and the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Functional Rating Scale-Revised (ALSFRS-R). [C-11]-PBR28 uptake was quantified as standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) and compared between groups. Cortical thickness and fractional anisotropy were compared between groups and correlated with SUVR and the clinical data. [C-11]-PBR28 uptake and ALSFRS-R were compared longitudinally over 6 months in 10 ALS individuals. ResultsWhole brain voxelwise, surface-based, and region of interest analyses revealed increased [C-11]-PBR28 uptake in the precentral and paracentral gyri in ALS, and in the subcortical white matter for the same regions in PLS, compared to controls. The increase in [C-11]-PBR28 uptake colocalized and correlated with cortical thinning, reduced fractional anisotropy, and increased mean diffusivity, and correlated with higher UMNB score. No significant changes were detected in [C-11]-PBR28 uptake over 6 months despite clinical progression.

This is a rather difficult segmentation problem because of the small area (i.e., volume) of the WMH and their similarity to non pathological brain tissue. We investigate the effectiveness of the 2D CNN scheme by comparing its performance against those obtained from another deep learning approach: Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), two conventional machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and a public toolbox: Lesion Segmentation Tool (LST), all reported to be useful for segmenting WMH in MRI. We also introduce a way to incorporate spatial information in convolution level of CNN for WMH segmentation named global spatial information (GSI). Analysis of covariance corroborated known associations between WMH progression, as assessed by all methods evaluated, and demographic and clinical data. Deep learning algorithms outperform conventional machine learning algorithms by excluding MRI artefacts and pathologies that appear similar to WMH.

We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using fiurodeoxyglucose and fiorbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2%) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p < 0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p < 0.05).

Accordingly, a scientific challenge has been promoted, on the international Kaggle platform, to assess the performance of different classification methods for prediction of MCI and its conversion to AD. New method: This work presents a classification strategy based on Random Forest feature selection and Deep Neural Network classification using a mixed cohort including the four classes of classification problem, that is HC, AD, MCI and cMCI, to train the model. Moreover, we compare this approach with a novel classification strategy based on fuzzy logic learned on a mixed cohort including only HC and AD. Experiments: A training set of 240 subjects and a test set including mixed cohort of 500 real and simulated subjects were used. The data included AD patients, MCI subjects converting to AD (cMCI), MCI subjects and healthy controls (HC). This work ranked third for overall accuracy (38.8%) over 19 participating teams. Comparison with existing method(s): The International challenge for automated prediction of MCI from MRI data hosted by the Kaggle platform has been promoted to validate different methodologies with a common set of data and evaluation procedures. Conclusion: DNNs reach a classification accuracy significantly higher than other machine learning strategies; on the other hand, fuzzy logic is particularly accurate with cMCI, suggesting a combination of these approaches could lead to interesting future perspectives.

Previous investigations have suggested that vascular risk factors (VRFs) were associated with cognitive decline and AD pathogenesis, and the intervention of VRFs may be a possible way to prevent dementia. However, in MCI, little is known about the potential impacts of VRFs on neural networks and their neural substrates, which may be a neuroimaging biomarker of the disease progression. Methods : 128 elderly Han Chinese participants (67 MCI subjects and 61 matched normal elderly) with or without VRFs (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, smoking and alcohol drinking) underwent the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and neuropsychological tests. We obtained the default mode network (DMN) to identify alterations in MCI with the varying number of the VRF and analyzed the significant correlation with behavioral performance. Results: The effects of VRF on the DMN were primarily in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) (i.e., middle frontal gyrus). Normal elderly showed the gradually increased functional activity of DLPFC, while a fluctuant activation of DLPFC was displayed in MCI with the growing number of the VRF. Interestingly, the left DLPFC further displayed significantly dynamic correlation with executive function as the variation of VRF loading. Initial level of compensation was observed in normal aging and none-vascular risk factor (NVRF) MCI, while these compensatory neural processes were suppressed in One-VRF MCI and were subsequently re-aroused in Over-One-VRF MCI. Conclusions: These findings suggested that the dose-dependent effects of VRF on DLPFC were highlighted in MCI, and the dynamic compensatory neural processes that fluctuated along with variations of VRF loading could be key role in the progression of MCI.;1663-4365;;;MAY 8;2018;10;10.3389/fnagi.2018.00131;J

The first was a cross-sectional imaging study of PD subjects (n=23) using the serotoninergic transporter positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [C-11]3-amino-4-(2-dimethylaminomethyl-phenylsulfaryl)-benzonitrile (DASB) and amyloid PET Pittsburgh compound B ([C-11]PiB).

However, age-related network changes commonly co-occur with neuropathological cascades, limiting efforts to disentangle disease-specific alterations in network function from those associated with normal ageing. Here we elucidate the differential effects of ageing and Alzheimer's disease pathology through simultaneous analyses of two functional connectivity MRI datasets: (i) young participants harbouring highly-penetrant mutations leading to autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN), an Alzheimer's disease cohort in which agerelated comorbidities are minimal and likelihood of progression along an Alzheimer's disease trajectory is extremely high; and (ii) young and elderly participants from the Harvard Aging Brain Study, a cohort in which imaging biomarkers of amyloid burden and neurodegeneration can be used to disambiguate ageing alone from preclinical Alzheimer's disease. Consonant with prior reports, we observed the preferential degradation of cognitive (especially the default and dorsal attention networks) over motor and sensory networks in early autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease, and found that this distinctive degradation pattern was magnified in more advanced stages of disease. Importantly, a nascent form of the pattern observed across the autosomal-dominant Alzheimer's disease spectrum was also detectable in clinically normal elderly with clear biomarker evidence of Alzheimer's disease pathology (preclinical Alzheimer's disease). At the more granular level of individual connections between node pairs, we observed that connections within cognitive networks were preferentially targeted in Alzheimer's disease (with between network connections relatively spared), and that connections between positively coupled nodes (correlations) were preferentially degraded as compared to connections between negatively coupled nodes (anti-correlations). In contrast, ageing in the absence of Alzheimer's disease biomarkers was characterized by a far less network-specific degradation across cognitive and sensory networks, of between-and within-network connections, and of connections between positively and negatively coupled nodes. We go on to demonstrate that formalizing the differential patterns of network degradation in ageing and Alzheimer's disease may have the practical benefit of yielding connectivity measurements that highlight early Alzheimer's disease-related connectivity changes over those due to agerelated processes. Together, the contrasting patterns of connectivity in Alzheimer's disease and ageing add to prior work arguing against Alzheimer's disease as a form of accelerated ageing, and suggest multi-network composite functional connectivity MRI metrics may be useful in the detection of early Alzheimer's disease-specific alterations co-occurring with age-related connectivity changes. More broadly, our findings are consistent with a specific pattern of network degradation associated with the spreading of Alzheimer's disease pathology within targeted neural networks.";0006-8950;1460-2156;;MAY;2018;141;10.1093/brain/awy053;J

Methods: Electronic databases were searched for published peer-reviewed articles which provided data on any neurotransmitter system in relation to agitation in AD. Screening of titles and abstracts and data extraction from full texts were conducted in duplicate. Results: Forty-five studies were included. Monoamines (serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) were most commonly investigated. A variety of methods were used to investigate the neurochemistry underlying agitation in AD and, although there were several conflicting findings, there was evidence of serotonergic deficit, relatively preserved dopaminergic function and compensatory overactivity of postsynaptic noradrenergic neurons in agitation in AD. Conclusions: Disruption of the dynamic balance between multiple neurotransmitter systems could impair functional neural networks involved in affective regulation and executive function. Differences in study design and methodology may have contributed to conflicting findings.

However, not all individuals clinically diagnosed with MCI progress to AD. A fraction of subjects with MCI either progress to non-AD dementia or remain stable at the MCI stage without progressing to dementia. Although a curative treatment of AD is currently unavailable, it is extremely important to correctly identify the individuals in the MCI phase that will go on to develop AD so that they may benefit from a curative treatment when one becomes available in the near future. At the same time, it would be highly desirable to also correctly identify those in the MCI phase that do not have AD pathology so they may be spared from unnecessary pharmocologic interventions that, at best, may provide them no benefit, and at worse, could further harm them with adverse side-effects. Additionally, it may be easier and simpler to identify the cause of the cognitive impairment in these non-AD cases, and hence proper identification of prodromal AD will be of benefit to these individuals as well. Fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) captures the metabolic activity of the brain, and this imaging modality has been reported to identify changes related to AD prior to the onset of structural changes. Prior work on designing classifier using FDG-PET imaging has been promising. Since deep-learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool to mine features and use them for accurate labeling of the group membership of given images, we propose a novel deep-learning framework using FDG-PET metabolism imaging to identify subjects at the MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and discriminate them from other subjects with MCI (non-AD / non-progressive). Our multiscale deep neural network obtained 82.51% accuracy of classification just using measures from a single modality (FDG-PET metabolism data) outperforming other comparable FDG-PET classifiers published in the recent literature.

According to the literature, a substantial number of bvFTD cases have been misdiagnosed as BD. Since the literature lacks studies comparing differential diagnosis ability of electrophysiological and neuroimaging findings in BD and bvFTD, we aimed to show their classification power using an artificial neural network and genetic algorithm based approach. Eighteen patients with the diagnosis of bvFTD and 20 patients with the diagnosis of late-life BD are included in the study. All patients' clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan and electroencephalography recordings were assessed by a double-blind method to make diagnosis from MRI data. Classification of bvFTD and BD from total 38 participants was performed using feature selection and a neural network based on general algorithm. The artificial neural network method classified BD from bvFTD with 76% overall accuracy only by using on EEG power values. The radiological diagnosis classified BD from bvFTD with 79% overall accuracy. When the radiological diagnosis was added to the EEG analysis, the total classification performance raised to 87% overall accuracy. These results suggest that EEG and MRI combination has more powerful classification ability as compared with EEG and MRI alone. The findings may support the utility of neurophysiological and structural neuroimaging assessments for discriminating the 2 pathologies.;1550-0594;2169-5202;;MAY;2018;49;10.1177/1550059417750914;J

Ann Nucl Med, 10.1007/s12149-018-1236-1, 2018). The aim of this study was to assess the biodistribution and radiation dosimetry of diagnostic dosages of F-18-FPYBF-2 in normal healthy volunteers as a first-in-man study. Four normal healthy volunteers (male: 3, female: 1; mean age: 40 +/- 17; age range 25-56) were included and underwent F-18-FPYBF-2 PET/CT study for the evaluation of radiation exposure and pharmacokinetics. A 10-min dynamic PET/CT scan of the body (chest and abdomen) was performed at 0-10 min and a 15-min whole-body static scan was performed six times after the injection of F-18-FPYBF-2. After reconstructing PET and CT image data, individual organ time-activity curves were estimated by fitting volume of interest data from the dynamic scan and whole-body scans. The OLINDA/EXM version 2.0 software was used to determine the whole-body effective doses. Dynamic PET imaging demonstrated that the hepatobiliary and renal systems were the principal pathways of clearance of F-18-FPYBF-2. High uptake in the liver and the gall bladder, the stomach, and the kidneys were demonstrated, followed by the intestines and the urinary bladder. The ED for the adult dosimetric model was estimated to be 8.48 +/- 1.25 A mu Sv/MBq. The higher absorbed doses were estimated for the liver (28.98 +/- 12.49 and 36.21 +/- 15.64 A mu Gy/MBq), the brain (20.93 +/- 4.56 and 23.05 +/- 5.03A mu Gy/MBq), the osteogenic cells (9.67 +/- 1.67 and 10.29 +/- 1.70 A mu Gy/MBq), the small intestines (9.12 +/- 2.61 and 11.12 +/- 3.15 A mu Gy/MBq), and the kidneys (7.81 +/- 2.62 and 8.71 +/- 2.90 A mu Gy/MBq) for male and female, respectively. The ED for the adult dosimetric model was similar to those of other agents used for amyloid PET imaging.

Metabolic acidosis, a common complication of CKD, leads to neural networks overexcitation and is involved in cerebral autoregulation. We aimed to evaluate the association between serum bicarbonate concentration as a measure of metabolic acidosis, and cognitive function in hypertensive adults with and without CKD. Design, setting, participants, & measurements Five cognitive summary scores were measured (global cognitive function, executive function, memory, attention/concentration, and language) in 2853 participants in the Systolic BP Intervention Trial (SPRINT). Multivariable linear regression models adjusted for demographics, comorbidities, systolic BP, medications, eGFR and albuminuria evaluated the cross-sectional association between bicarbonate and cognition at SPRINT baseline. In a subset (n=681) who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging, the models were adjusted for white matter hyperintensity volume, vascular reactivity, and cerebral blood flow.

Global cognitive and executive functions were positively associated with serum bicarbonate (estimate [SEM]: 0.014 [0.006]; P=0.01, and 0.018 [0.006]; P=0.003, respectively). Each 1 mEq/L lower bicarbonate level had a similar association with global cognitive and executive function as being 4.3 and 5.4 months older, respectively. The association with global cognition persisted after magnetic resonance imaging findings adjustment (estimate [SEM]: 0.03 [0.01]; P=0.01).

MethodsWe performed PET-guided MRS in cases of probable AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and healthy controls (HC). All participants were imaged by C-11-Pittsburgh compound B (C-11-PiB) and F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose (F-18-FDG) PET followed by 3T MRS. PET images were assessed both visually and using standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs). MRS voxels were placed in regions with maximum abnormality on amyloid (A+) and FDG (hypometabolic) areas on PET scans. Corresponding normal areas were selected in controls. The ratios of total N-acetyl (tNA) group, myoinositol (mI), choline, and glutamate+glutamine over creatine (Cr) were compared between these regions. ResultsA+regions had significantly higher (p=0.02) mI/Cr and lower tNA/Cr (p=0.02), whereas in hypometabolic areas only tNA/Cr was reduced (p=0.003). Multiple regression analysis adjusting for sex, age, and education showed mI/Cr was only associated with C-11-PiB SUVR (p<0.0001). tNA/Cr, however, was associated with both PiB (p=0.0003) and F-18-FDG SUVR (p=0.006). The level of mI/Cr was not significantly different between MCI and AD (p=0.28), but tNA/Cr showed significant decline from HC to MCI to AD (p=0.001, p=0.04). InterpretationmI/Cr has significant temporal and spatial associations with A and could potentially be considered as a disease state biomarker. tNA is an indicator of early neurodegenerative changes and might have a role as disease stage biomarker and also as a valuable surrogate marker for treatment response.

Methods: After a brain parcellation, a region is described by its histogram of gray levels, and the Earth mover's distance establishes how close or far these regions are. The medoid of the control group is set as the reference and any brain is characterized by its set of distances to this medoid. Evaluation: This hypothesis was assessed by separating groups of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment from control subjects, using a subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. An additional experiment evaluated the method generalization and consisted in training with the OASIS data and testing with the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) database. Results: Classification between controls and patients with AD resulted in an equal error rate of 0.1 (90% of sensitivity and specificity at the same time). The automatic ranking of regions resulting is in strong agreement with those regions described as important in clinical practice. Classification with different databases results in a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 91%.

In the existing literature, support vector machine (SVM) has always been applied to distinguish between AD and healthy controls (HC) based on neuroimaging data. But previous studies have only used a single SVM to classify AD and HC, and the accuracy is not very high and generally less than 90%.

From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database, the subjects including 25 AD individuals and 35 HC individuals were obtained. The classification accuracy could reach to 94.44% in the results. Furthermore, the method could also be used for feature selection and the accuracy could be maintained at the level of 94.44%. In addition, we could also find out abnormal brain regions (inferior frontal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus and cingulate cortex).

MethodsWe performed statistical parametric mapping of [F-18]AV-1451 across 40 PPA patients (logopenic-PPA=14, semantic-PPA=13, and agrammatic-PPA=13) compared to 80 cognitively normal, Pittsburgh compound B-negative controls, age and gender matched 2:1. Principal component analysis of regional [F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET standard uptake value ratio was performed to understand underlying patterns of [F-18]AV-1451 uptake independent of clinical diagnosis. Penalized multinomial regression analyses were utilized to assess diagnostic utility. ResultsLogopenic-PPA showed striking uptake throughout neocortex, particularly temporoparietal, compared to controls, semantic-PPA, and agrammatic-PPA. Semantic-PPA and agrammatic-PPA showed milder patterns of focal [F-18]AV-1451 uptake. Semantic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left>right) in anteromedial temporal lobes, compared to controls and agrammatic-PPA. Agrammatic-PPA showed elevated uptake (left>right) throughout prefrontal white matter and in subcortical gray matter structures, compared to controls and semantic-PPA. The principal component analysis of regional [F-18]AV-1451 indicated two primary dimensions, a severity dimension that distinguished logopenic-PPA from agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA, and a frontal versus temporal contrast that distinguishes agrammatic-PPA and semantic-PPA cases. Diagnostic utility of [F-18]AV-1451was superior to MRI and at least equal to FDG-PET. Interpretation[F-18]AV-1451binding characteristics differ across the PPA variants and were excellent at distinguishing between the variants.

"Fletcher, JM; Wennekers, T";"Fletcher, Jack McKay; Wennekers, Thomas";From Structure to Activity: Using Centrality Measures to Predict Neuronal Activity;INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NEURAL SYSTEMS;It is clear that the topological structure of a neural network somehow determines the activity of the neurons within it. In the present work, we ask to what extent it is possible to examine the structural features of a network and learn something about its activity? Specifically, we consider how the centrality (the importance of a node in a network) of a neuron correlates with its firing rate. To investigate, we apply an array of centrality measures, including In-Degree, Closeness, Betweenness, Eigenvector, Katz, PageRank, Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS) and NeuronRank to Leaky-Integrate and Fire neural networks with different connectivity schemes. We find that Katz centrality is the best predictor of firing rate given the network structure, with almost perfect correlation in all cases studied, which include purely excitatory and excitatory-inhibitory networks, with either homogeneous connections or a small-world structure. We identify the properties of a network which will cause this correlation to hold. We argue that the reason Katz centrality correlates so highly with neuronal activity compared to other centrality measures is because it nicely captures disinhibition in neural networks. In addition, we argue that these theoretical findings are applicable to neuroscientists who apply centrality measures to functional brain networks, as well as offer a neurophysiological justification to high level cognitive models which use certain centrality measures.;0129-0657;1793-6462;;MAR;2018;28;10.1142/S0129065717500137;J

MethodsWe calculated [F-18]AV-1451 uptake in entorhinal cortex and neocortex in 62 amyloid-positive AD patients (39 typical and 23 atypical presentation). tau-PET (positron emission tomography) values were normalized to the cerebellum to create standard uptake value ratios (SUVRs). tau-PET SUVRs were log-transformed and clustered blinded to clinical information into three groups using K-median cluster analysis. Demographics, clinical phenotype, cognitive performance, and apolipoprotein e4 frequency were compared across clusters. ResultsThe cluster analysis identified a cluster with low entorhinal and cortical uptake (E-Lo/C-Lo), one with low entorhinal but high cortical uptake (E-Lo/C-Hi), and one with high cortical and entorhinal uptake (E-Hi/C-Hi). Clinical phenotype differed across clusters, with typical AD most commonly observed in the E-Lo/C-Lo and E-Hi/C-Hi clusters, and atypical AD most commonly observed in the E-Lo/C-Hi cluster. The E-Lo/C-Lo cluster had an older age at PET and onset than the other clusters. Apolipoprotein e4 frequency was lower in the E-Lo/C-Hi cluster. The E-Hi/C-Hi cluster had the worst memory impairment, whereas the E-Lo/C-Hi cluster had the worst impairment in nonmemory domains. InterpretationThis study demonstrates considerable variability in [F-18]AV-1451 tau-PET uptake in AD, but shows that a straightforward clustering based on entorhinal and cortical uptake maps well onto age and clinical presentation in AD.

Hypothesis: We hypothesize that up-training alpha and down-training beta and gamma activity in the posterior cingulate cortex has a moderating effect on tinnitus related distress by influencing neural activity of the target region as well as the connectivity within the default network and other functionally connected brain areas. Methods: Fifty-eight patients with chronic tinnitus were included in the study. Twenty-three tinnitus patients received neurofeedback training of the posterior cingulate cortex with the aim of up-training alpha and down-training beta and gamma activity, while 17 patients underwent training of the lingual gyrus as a control situation. A second control group consisted of 18 tinnitus patients on a waiting list for future tinnitus treatment. Results: This study revealed that neurofeedback training of the posterior cingulate cortex results in a significant decrease of tinnitus related distress. No significant effect on neural activity of the target region could be obtained. However, functional and effectivity connectivity changes were demonstrated between remote brain regions or functional networks as well as by altering cross frequency coupling of the posterior cingulate cortex. Conclusion: This suggests that neurofeedback could remove the information, processed in beta and gamma, from the carrier wave, alpha, which transports the high frequency information and influences the salience attributed to the tinnitus sound. Based on the observation that much pathology is the result of an abnormal functional connectivity within and between neural networks various pathologies should be considered eligible candidates for the application of source localized EEG based neurofeedback training.

Although high occupation levels can be associated with higher cognitive reserve in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), it was never addressed how specific occupation profiles involving social interaction, executive and attention abilities can modulate neural reserve in bvFTD. Materials and methods: We retrospectively included thirty-seven bvFTD patients with clinical-neuropsychological and FDG-PET brain metabolic data. We considered occupation levels according to 1) a 5-point scale and 2) the specific cognitive dimensions from the O*Net network database. We used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the O*Net variables most representative of worker and occupation socio-cognitive skills to merge the best components describing such occupation profiles. We then performed regression analyses with brain metabolism using either 5-level occupation scale or the PCA specific profiles as independent variables, controlling for education and disease severity. Results: According to the brain reserve hypothesis, higher occupation levels were associated with a more severe hypometabolism in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, among the identified PCA profiles, social skills were associated with severe hypo metabolism in medial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and cognitive control in the left fronto-insular cortex. Discussion: This study contributes to define the role of specific occupation profiles as proxy of cognitive reserve in bvFTD, providing the first evidence for social interaction and cognitive control skills in life-occupation activities as influencing factors of neural reserve against neurodegeneration in bvFTD. Jobs placing high demand on such abilities seem to act as protective factors in bvFTD. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.;0010-9452;1973-8102;;FEB;2018;99;10.1016/j.cortex.2017.12.006;J

However, even for an expert neuroradiologist, tracing the hippocampus and measuring its volume is a time consuming and extremely challenging task. Accordingly, the development of reliable fully-automated segmentation algorithms is of paramount importance. Materials and methods: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and the robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network (HUMAN) segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD diagnosis. For these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects and their T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The cohort included 145 controls (CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 94 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the baseline, repeat, 12 and 24 month follow-up scans were available. Results: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3% precision; volume measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) AUC(1) = 0.08 +/- 0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler effects present in MCI subjects, AUC(2) = 0.76 +/- 0.05. The algorithm is stable and reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN, can effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become a useful tool for other neuroimaging applications.";1475-925X;;;JAN 22;2018;17;10.1186/s12938-018-0439-y;J

PD patients (n = 105) and matched controls (n = 57) underwent T1-MRI at entry and 1 year later as part of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Over this period, PD patients demonstrate significantly greater cortical thinning than controls in parts of the left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally or structurally) to a disease reservoir evaluated by MRI at baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex in PD follows neuronal connectivity and that disease spread to the cortex may herald the onset of cognitive impairment.;2041-1723;;;JAN 2;2018;9;10.1038/s41467-017-02416-0;J

Due the difficulty of fitting a PK model to noisy PET data with limited time points, such 'fixed-R-1' techniques are constrained to a 30min minimum acquisition, which is intolerable for many patients. In this work we apply a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) approach to combine the PET and MRI data. This permits shorter acquisition times as it avoids the noise sensitive voxelwise PK modelling and facilitates the full modelling of the relationship between blood flow and the dynamic PET data. This method is compared to three fixed-R-1 PK methods, and the clinically used standardised uptake value ratio (SUVR), using 60 min dynamic PET PK modelling as the gold standard. Testing on 11 subjects participating in a study of pre-clinical Alzheimer's Disease showed that, for 30min acquisitions, all methods which combine the PET and MRI data have comparable performance, however at shorter acquisition times the CNN approach has a significantly lower mean square error (MSE) compared to fixed-R-1 PK modelling (p = 0.001). For both acquisition windows, SUVR had a significantly higher MSE than the CNN method (p <= 0.003). This demonstrates that combining simultaneous PET and MRI data using a CNN can result in robust PET quantification within a scan time which is tolerable to patients with dementia.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00928-1; 978-3-030-00927-4";;2018;11070;10.1007/978-3-030-00928-1_6;S

The choice of such a region often varies between studies which can substantially influence the quantification, resulting in study bias hampering objective findings which are detrimental to open science. This study outlines a list of criteria and a statistical ranking approach for identifying normalization region of interest. The proposed criteria include (i) associations between reference region and demographics such as age, (ii) diagnostic group differences in the reference region, (iii) correlation between reference and primary areas of interest, (iv) local variance in the reference region, and (v) longitudinal reproducibility of the target regions when normalized. The proposed approach has been used to establish an optimal normalization region of interest for the analysis of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). This was achieved by using cross-sectional data from 119 subjects with normal cognition, mild cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease as well as and 19 healthy elderly individuals with longitudinal data. For the QSM application, we found that normalizing by the white matter regions not only satisfies the criteria but it also provides the best separation between clinical groups for deep brain nuclei target regions.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00928-1; 978-3-030-00927-4";;2018;11070;10.1007/978-3-030-00928-1_8;S
"Kam, TE; Zhang, H; Shen, DG";"Kam, Tae-Eui; Zhang, Han; Shen, Dinggang";A Novel Deep Learning Framework on Brain Functional Networks for Early MCI Diagnosis;MEDICAL IMAGE COMPUTING AND COMPUTER ASSISTED INTERVENTION, PT III;Although alternations of brain functional networks (BFNs) derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been considered as promising biomarkers for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis, it is still challenging to perform individualized diagnosis, especially at the very early stage of preclinical stage of AD, i.e., early mild cognitive impairment (eMCI). Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) show powerful ability in computer vision and image analysis applications, but there is still a gap for directly applying CNNs to rs-fMRI-based disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel multiple-BFN-based 3D CNN framework that can automatically and deeply learn complex, high-level, hierarchical diagnostic features from various independent component analysis-derived BFNs. More importantly, the embedded features of different BFNs could comprehensively support each other towards a more accurate eMCI diagnosis in a unified model. The performance of the proposed method is validated by a large-sample, multisite, rigorously controlled publicly accessible dataset. The proposed framework can also be conveniently and straightforwardly applied to individualized diagnosis of various neurological and psychiatric diseases.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00931-1; 978-3-030-00930-4";;2018;11072;10.1007/978-3-030-00931-1_34;S

However, in practice, it is unavoidable to have missing data, i. e., missing PET data for many subjects in the ADNI dataset. A straightforward strategy to tackle this challenge is to simply discard subjects with missing PET, but this will significantly reduce the number of training subjects for learning reliable diagnostic models. On the other hand, since different modalities (i. e., MRI and PET) were acquired from the same subject, there often exist underlying relevance between different modalities. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage deep learning framework for AD diagnosis using both MRI and PET data. Specifically, in the first stage, we impute missing PET data based on their corresponding MRI data by using 3D Cycle-consistent Generative Adversarial Networks (3D-cGAN) to capture their underlying relationship. In the second stage, with the complete MRI and PET (i. e., after imputation for the case of missing PET), we develop a deep multi-instance neural network for AD diagnosis and also mild cognitive impairment (MCI) conversion prediction. Experimental results on subjects from ADNI demonstrate that our synthesized PET images with 3D-cGAN are reasonable, and also our two-stage deep learning method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in AD diagnosis.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00931-1; 978-3-030-00930-4";;2018;11072;10.1007/978-3-030-00931-1_52;S

To realize the full potential of deep learning for PET imaging, large datasets are required for training. However, dataset sizes are restricted due to limited availability. Meanwhile, most of the AD classification studies have been based on structural MRI rather than PET. In this paper, we propose a novel application of conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs) to the generation of F-18-florbetapir PET images from corresponding MRI images. Furthermore, we show that generated PET images can be used for synthetic data augmentation, and improve the performance of 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for predicting progression to AD. Our method is applied to a dataset of 79 PET images, obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We generate high quality PET images from corresponding MRIs using cGANs, and we evaluate the quality of generated PET images by comparison to real images. We then use the trained cGANs to generate synthetic PET images from additional MRI dataset. Finally we build a 152-layer ResNet to compare the MCI classification performance using both traditional data augmentation method and our proposed synthetic data augmentation method.

The proposed framework exploits the merits of 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) and stacked bidirectional recurrent neural network (SBi-RNN). Specifically, we devise simple 3D-CNN architecture to obtain the deep feature representation from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) images, respectively. We further apply SBi-RNN on the local deep cascaded and flattened descriptors for performance boosting. Extensive experiments are performed on the ADNI dataset to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

While a growing number of studies have demonstrated the promise of machine learning algorithms for rs-fMRI based clinical or behavioral prediction, most prior models have been limited in their capacity to exploit the richness of the data. For example, classification techniques applied to rs-fMRI often rely on region-based summary statistics and/or linear models. In this work, we propose a novel volumetric Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework that takes advantage of the full-resolution 3D spatial structure of rs-fMRI data and fits non-linear predictive models.

Traditional methods usually construct connectivity networks (CNs) by simply calculating Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) between time series of brain regions, and then extract low-level network measures as features to train the learning model. However, the valuable observation information in network construction (e.g., specific contributions of different time points) and high-level (i.e., high-order) network properties are neglected in these methods. In this paper, we first define a novel weighted correlation kernel (called wc-kernel) to measure the correlation of brain regions, by which weighting factors are determined in a data-driven manner to characterize the contribution of each time point, thus conveying the richer interaction information of brain regions compared with the PCC method. Furthermore, we propose a wc-kernel based convolutional neural network (CNN) (called wck-CNN) framework for extracting the hierarchical (i.e., from low-order to high-order) functional connectivities for disease diagnosis, by using fMRI data. Specifically, we first define a layer to build dynamic CNs (DCNs) using the defined wc-kernels. Then, we define three layers to extract local (region specific), global (network specific) and temporal high-order properties from the constructed low-order functional connectivities as features for classification. Results on 174 subjects (a total of 563 scans) with rs-fMRI data from ADNI suggest that the our method can not only improve the performance compared with state-of-the-art methods, but also provide novel insights into the interaction patterns of brain activities and their changes in diseases.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00919-9; 978-3-030-00918-2";;2018;11046;10.1007/978-3-030-00919-9_1;S

Specifically, we parcellate a brain into predefined regions by using anatomical knowledge, i.e., template, and find complex nonlinear relations among voxels, whose intensity denotes the volumetric measure in our case, within each region. Unlike the existing methods that mostly use a cubical or rectangular shape, we regard the anatomical shape of regions as atypical forms of patches. Using the complex nonlinear relations among voxels in each region learned by deep neural networks, we extract a regional abnormality representation. We then make a final clinical decision by integrating the regional abnormality representations over a whole brain. It is noteworthy that the regional abnormality representations allow us to interpret and understand the symptomatic observations of a subject with AD or MCI by mapping and visualizing them in a brain space individually. We validated the efficacy of our method in experiments with baseline MRI dataset in the ADNI cohort by achieving promising performances in three binary classification tasks.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00919-9; 978-3-030-00918-2";;2018;11046;10.1007/978-3-030-00919-9_8;S

This shortcoming can be explained by the relatively small number of available labeled subjects, the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data, and difficulties in interpreting the results of deep learning methods. In this paper, we propose a simple 3D Convolutional Neural Networks and exploit its model parameters to tailor the end-to-end architecture for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our model can diagnose AD with an accuracy of 94.1% on the popular ADNI dataset using only MRI data, which outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

Moreover, the lack of actual ground truth might limit the performance of any machine learning method to that of human performance. Yet, the automatic identification of those lesions is relevant to quantify cerebrovascular burden associated with dementia, such as identifying co-morbidity for Alzheimer's disease. In this paper, we investigated a novel approach consisting of simulating synthetic CMB on SWI MRI scans from healthy individuals to create a large and well characterized training dataset, as a data augmentation strategy. Firstly, we characterized actual CMBs from MRI SWI scans and designed a method to create realistic synthetic CMBs whose location, shape, appearance, and size are similar to actual CMBs. We then tested a supervised neural network classifier using various combinations of actual CMB and synthetic CMBs for training. Augmenting data with synthetic CMBs resulted in a large improvement over training on only actual CMBs only when tested on unseen lesions, and provided better results than other standard data augmentation approaches. Our results suggest that data augmentation using synthetic lesions can address the lack of ground truth and low prevalence limitations for medical imaging analysis allowing the deployment of data hungry supervised learning techniques such as deep learning.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-00536-8; 978-3-030-00535-1";;2018;11037;10.1007/978-3-030-00536-8_2;S

Deep Learning is state-of-the-art learning algorithm in classification and exceptionally efficacious in extracting high level features from multi-dimensional data. In this system we use Convolutional Neural Network particularly for classification of fMRI clinical data on stages of Alzheimer's disease brain from Diseased(AD), Early Mild Cognitive Impairment(EMCI) to those who are normal, having healthy brains. Usage of MRI data has already been done[1] for binary classification. We aim to generalize the classifier into categorizing the images into three different distinct classes. The deep learning pipeline involved critical steps of correctly preprocessing 4D fMRI images i.e. 3D images varying with time. The preprocessing steps involved, proved to be critical in having distinct 2D image slices of Normal, EMCI and AD for better accuracy in understanding the most discriminative features of the fMRI brain scans. Transfer Learning is the concept involved wherein we utilize pretrained complex deep models for classification of images.

And the optimization algorithm is used to replace the network model. The valence function is optimized iteratively, the weight matrix is studied and the new feature expression is obtained. Finally, the Softmax classifier and the auxiliary fine-tuning method are used to identify the disease.

Many different methods and algorithms have been applied to extract patterns from neuroimaging data in order to distinguish different stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the similarity of the brain patterns in older adults and in different stages makes the classification of different stages a challenge for researchers. In this paper, convolutional neuronal network architecture AlexNet was applied to fMRI datasets to classify different stages of the disease. We classified five different stages of Alzheimer's using a deep learning algorithm. The method successfully classified normal healthy control (NC), significant memory concern (SMC), early mild cognitive impair (EMCI), late cognitive mild impair (LMCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The model was implemented using GPU high performance computing. Before applying any classification, the fMRI data were strictly preprocessed. Then, low to high level features were extracted and learned using the AlexNet model. Our experiments show significant improvement in classification. The average accuracy of the model was 97.63%. We then tested our model on test datasets to evaluate the accuracy of the model per class, obtaining an accuracy of 94.97% for AD, 95.64% for EMCI, 95.89% for LMCI, 98.34% for NC, and 94.55% for SMC.;;;978-1-5386-1399-3;;2018;;;B

In the recent decade, a variety of machine learning algorithms have been explored and used for AD diagnosis, focusing on its subtle prodromal stage of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to assess essential features that characterize its early manifestation and to plan for early treatment. However, diagnosis of early MCI (EMCI) remains most challenging as it is extremely difficult to delineate from cognitively normal controls (CN), and as a consequence, most of the classification algorithms for these two groups are mixed with low classification accuracy results. In this study, a machine learning approach based on deep neural network (DNN) has been proposed in order to detect AD in its early stage using multimodal imaging, combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET) and standard neuropsychological test scores. The proposed approach makes use of the optimization method of Adam to update the learning weights in order to improve its accuracy. The algorithm is able to classify cognitively normal control group from EMCI with an unprecedented accuracy of 84.0%. Although the focus here is distinguishing the two groups of CN and EMCI for early diagnosis and treatment planning, this study also shows how the proposed deep learning algorithm can be extended for multiclass classification involving CN and all the stages of EMCI, late MCI (LMCI) and AD.;;;978-1-5386-6805-4;;2018;;10.1109/ICMLA.2018.00218;B

Computer-aided detection methods can uncover crucial information recorded by electroencephalograms. A systematic literature search presents the wavelet transform as a frequently used technique in Alzheimer's detection. However, it requires a defined basis function considered a significant problem. In this work, the concept of empirical mode decomposition is introduced as an alternative to process Alzheimer signals. The performance of empirical mode decomposition heavily relies on a parameter called threshold. In our previous works, we found that the existing thresholding techniques were not able to highlight relevant information. The use of Tsallis entropy as a thresholder is evaluated through the combination of empirical mode decomposition and neural networks. Thanks to the extraction of better features that boost the classification accuracy, the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of peak signal to noise ratio and root mean square error. Hence, our methodology is more likely to succeed than methods based on other landmarks such as Bayes, Normal and Visu shrink.

The subcortical and ventricular volumes change for AD patients. These volumes can be extracted from MRI by tools such as FreeSurfer and the multi-atlas-based likelihood fusion (MALF) algorithm. Studies use MRI from many medical imaging centers. However, individual centers typically use distinctive MRI protocols for brain scanning. The protocol differences include different scanner models with various operating parameters. Some scanner models have different field strengths. A key factor in classifying multicentric MR subject images having different protocols is how different scanner models affect the extraction of feature, and the subsequent classification performance of a supervised classifier. We have investigated the classification performance of FreeSurfer and MALF based volume features together with Radial Basis Function Support Vector Machine and Extreme Learning Machine across different imaging protocols. We have also investigated for both FreeSurfer and MALF, which brain regions are most effective for the detection of the disease under different protocols.

This is typically done by applying convolutional neural networks to slices of a 3D brain image volume. Each slice of the brain volume, however, represents only a small cross-sectional area of the cortical layer. On the other hand, convolutional neural networks are less well developed for 3D volumes. Therefore we sought to apply deep networks to the 2D cortical surface, for the purpose of classifying Alzheimer's disease (AD). AD is known to affect the thickness and geometry of the cortical surface of the brain. Although the cortical surface has a complex geometry, here we present a novel data processing method to feed the information of an entire cortical surface into existing deep networks for more accurate early disease detection. A brain 3D MRI volume is registered and its cortical surface is flattened to a 2D plane. The flattened distributions of the thickness, curvature and surface area are combined into an RBG image which can be readily fed to existing deep networks. In this paper, the ADNI dataset of brain MRI scans are used and flattened cortical images are applied to different deep networks including ResNet and Inception. Two pre-clinical stages of AD are considered; stable mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) and converting mild cognitive impairment (MCIc). Experiments show that using flattened cortical images consistently leads to higher accuracy compared to using brain slices with the same network architecture. Specifically, the highest accuracy of 81% is achieved by Inception with flattened cortical images, as compared to 68% by the same network on brain slices and 75.9% accuracy by the best method in the literature which also used a deep network on brain slices.

Florbetapir positron emission tomography (F-18-AV-45 PET) is proven to be the most powerful imaging technique to investigate the deposition of amyloid plaques, one of the potential hallmarks of AD, signifying the onset of AD before it changes the brains structure. In this paper, we propose a novel classification algorithm to discriminate the patients having AD, early mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late MCI, and normal control in F-18-AV-45 PET using shearlet based deep convolutional neural network (CNN). It is known that the conventional CNNs involve convolution and pooling layers, which in fact produce the smoothed representation of data, and this results in losing detailed information. In view of this fact, the conventional CNN is integrated with shearlet transform incorporating the multiresolution details of the data. Once the model is pretrained to transform the input data into a better stacked representation, the resulting final layer is passed to softmnax classifier, which returns the probabilities of each class. Through experimental results, it is shown that the performance of the proposed classification framework is superior to that of the traditional CNN in Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database in terms of classification accuracy.

However, a common bottleneck of the diagnostic performance is overfitting due to having lot of irrelevant features in the training data. In view of this fact, we propose a novel classification framework which uses unsupervised autoencoder network to select the subset from given structural and clinical features by exploring the linear and nonlinear relationship among them followed by a supervised multinomial logistic layer to automatically identify the patients having AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and cognitively normal (CN) clinical status. Through experimental results on Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) database, it is shown that the proposed classification algorithm achieves better performance in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in 5-fold cross validation when compared to the state-of-the-art methods.;1548-3746;;978-1-5386-7392-8;;2018;;;S

As a result, multi-modality data are usually incomplete, raising the multi-modality missing data completion problem. In this work, we formulate the problem as a conditional image generation task and propose an encoder-decoder deep neural network to tackle this problem. Specifically, the model takes the existing modality as input and generates the missing modality. By employing an auxiliary adversarial loss, our model is able to generate high-quality missing modality images. At the same time, we propose to incorporate the available category information of subjects in training to enable the model to generate more informative images. We evaluate our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, where positron emission tomography (PET) modalities are missing. Experimental results show that the trained network can generate high-quality PET modalities based on existing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) modalities, and provide complementary information to improve the detection and tracking of the Alzheimer's disease. Our results also show that the proposed methods generate higher quality images than baseline methods as measured by various image quality statistics.;;;978-1-4503-5552-0;;2018;;10.1145/3219819.3219963;B

For each radiotracer, in silico MLogP, V-x, and in vitro K-D were input into the model to predict the in vivo K-1, k(2), and BPND under healthy control (HC), mild cognitive impaired (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD) conditions. These kinetic parameters were used to simulate the time activity curves (TACs) in the target regions of HC, MCI, and AD and a reference region. Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVR) were determined from the integrated area under the TACs of the target region over the reference region within a default time window of 90-110min. The predicted K-1, k(2), and BPND values were compared with the clinically observed values. The TACs and SUVR distributions were also simulated with population variations and noise. Finally, the clinical usefulness index (CUI) ranking was compared with clinical comparison results. The TACs and SUVR distributions differed for tau radiotracers with lower tau selectivity. The CUI values ranged from 0.0 to 16.2, with 6 out of 9 clinically applied tau radiotracers having CUI values higher than the recommend CUI value of 3.0. The differences between the clinically observed TACs and SUVR results showed that the evaluation of the clinical usefulness of tau radiotracer based on single target binding could not fully reflect in vivo tau binding. The screening methodology requires further study to improve the accuracy of screening tau radiotracers. However, the higher CUI rankings of clinically applied tau radiotracers with higher signal-to-noise ratio supported the use of the screening methodology in radiotracer development by allowing comparison of candidate radiotracers with clinically applied radiotracers based on SUVR, with respect to binding to a single target.;1748-670X;1748-6718;;;2018;2018;10.1155/2018/6287913;J

This paper proposes to improve the prediction of AD with a deep 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3D-CNN), which can show generic features capturing AD biomarkers extracted from brain images, adapt to different domain datasets, and accurately classify subjects with improved fine-tuning method. The 3D-CNN is built upon a convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans for source domain. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification in target domain. In this paper, deep supervision algorithm is used to improve the performance of already proposed 3D Adaptive CNN. Experiments on the ADNI MRI dataset without skull-stripping preprocessing have shown that the proposed 3D Deeply Supervised Adaptable CNN outperforms several proposed approaches, including 3D-CNN model, other CNN-based methods and conventional classifiers by accuracy and robustness.

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both largescale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM- SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information.

Currently, 46.8 million people have dementia worldwide, and that figure is predicted to increase threefold to 130 million people by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cost of care for AD patients in 2015 was 818 billion US dollars and is expected to increase dramatically in the future, due to the increasing number of patients as a result of the aging society. However, it is still very difficult to cure AD; thus, the detection of AD is crucial. This study proposes the use of machine learning to detect AD using brain image data, with the goal of reducing the cost of diagnosing and caring for AD patients. Most machine learning algorithms rely on good feature representations, which are commonly obtained manually and require domain experts to provide guidance. Feature extraction is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. In contrast, the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) automatically learns feature representation from images and is not greatly affected by image processing.

Scholars often use computer vision and machine learning methods to develop an automatic diagnosis system. Objective: In this study, we developed a novel machine learning system that can make diagnoses automatically from brain magnetic resonance images. Methods: First, the brain imaging was processed, including skull stripping and spatial normalization. Second, one axial slice was selected from the volumetric image, and stationary wavelet entropy (SWE) was done to extract the texture features. Third, a single-hidden-layer neural network was used as the classifier. Finally, a predator-prey particle swarm optimization was proposed to train the weights and biases of the classifier. Results: Our method used 4-level decomposition and yielded 13 SWE features. The classification yielded an overall accuracy of 92.73 +/- 1.03%, a sensitivity of 92.69 +/- 1.29%, and a specificity of 92.78 +/- 1.51%. The area under the curve is 0.95 +/- 0.02. Additionally, this method only cost 0.88 s to identify a subject in online stage, after its volumetric image is preprocessed.

Magnetic Resonance Imaging provides a unique tool for non-invasive investigation of these brain diseases. However, it is extremely difficult for neurologists to identify complex disease patterns from large amounts of three-dimensional images. In contrast, machine learning excels at automatic pattern recognition from large amounts of data. In particular, deep learning has achieved impressive results in image classification. Unfortunately, its application to medical image classification remains difficult. We consider two reasons for this difficulty: First, volumetric medical image data is considerably scarcer than natural images. Second, the complexity of 3D medical images is much higher compared to common 2D images. To address the problem of small data set size, we assemble the largest dataset ever used for training a deep 3D convolutional neural network to classify brain images as healthy (HC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimers disease (AD). We use more than 20.000 images from subjects of these three classes, which is almost 9x the size of the previously largest data set. The problem of high dimensionality is addressed by using a deep 3D convolutional neural network, which is state-of-the-art in large-scale image classification. We exploit its ability to process the images directly, only with standard preprocessing, but without the need for elaborate feature engineering.

"Cui, RX; Liu, MH";"Cui, Ruoxuan; Liu, Manhua";Hippocampus Analysis Based on 3D CNN for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis;TENTH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON DIGITAL IMAGE PROCESSING (ICDIP 2018);Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common brain dementia, which effects human memory, thinking and behavior. It has been proven that hippocampus is an important region related to AD diagnosis. Most of the existing methods on hippocampus analysis are based on the shape and volume analysis of the bilateral hippocampi. However, the 3D structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) can capture more useful information of hippocampus and its adjacent regions. In this paper, we propose a new method based on deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) for hippocampus analysis using 3D MR images for AD diagnosis. First, two hippocampi are segmented from other regions and the centers of hippocampus regions are calculated. Then, based on each hippocampus center, a local 3D image patch is extracted from the 3D MR image to cover each hippocampus region. Next, a deep 3D CNN model is constructed to extract the hierarchical imaging features for each hippocampus, followed by a softmax layer to generate a class prediction score for AD diagnosis. Finally, the classification is made by combination of the prediction scores from two hippocampi. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted structural MR images on 231 subjects including 101 AD patients and 130 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 86.98% for classification of AD vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance.;0277-786X;1996-756X;978-1-5106-2200-5;;2018;10806;10.1117/12.2503194;S

Static graph networks are the mathematical structure to capture these interactions modeled by Pearson correlations between the representative area signals. Dynamical functional resting state networks seen in most fMRI experiments can not be represented by the classic correlation graph network. The changes in brain connectivity observed in many neuro-degenerative diseases in longitudinal data series suggest that more sophisticated graph networks to capture the dynamical properties of the brain networks are required. Furthermore, certain brain areas seem to act as disease epicenters being responsible for the spread of neuro-degenerative diseases. To mathematically describe these aspects, we propose a novel framework based on pinning controllability applied to dynamic graphs and seek to determine the changes in the driver nodes during the course of the disease. In contrast to other current research in pinning controllability, we aim to identify the best driver nodes describing disease evolution with respect to connectivity changes and location of the best driver nodes in functional F-18-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography ((18)FDG-PET) and structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) connectivity graphs in healthy controls (CN), and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We present the theoretical framework for determining the best driver nodes in connectivity graphs and their relation to disease evolution in dementia. We revolutionize the current graph analysis in brain networks and apply the concept of dynamic graph theory in connection with pinning controllability to reveal differences in the location of disease epicenters that play an important role in the temporal evolution of dementia.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) revealed abnormalities in AD in intrinsic synchronization between spatially separate regions in the so-called default mode network (DMN) of the brain. To understand the relationship between this disruption in large-scale synchrony and the cognitive impairment in AD, it is critical to determine whether and how the deficit in the low frequency hemodynamic fluctuations recorded by fMRI translates to much faster timescales of memory and other cognitive processes. The present study employed magnetoencephalography (MEG) and a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) approach to estimate spontaneous synchrony variations in the functional neural networks with high temporal resolution. In a group of cognitively healthy (CH) older adults, we found transient (mean duration of 150-250 ms) network activity states, which were visited in a rapid succession, and were characterized by spatially coordinated changes in the amplitude of source-localized electrophysiological oscillations. The inferred states were similar to those previously observed in younger participants using MEG, and the estimated cortical source distributions of the state-specific activity resembled the classic functional neural networks, such as the DMN. In patients with AD, inferred network states were different from those of the CH group in short-scale timing and oscillatory features. The state of increased oscillatory amplitudes in the regions overlapping the DMN was visited less often in AD and for shorter periods of time, suggesting that spontaneous synchronization in this network was less likely and less stable in the patients. During the visits to this state, in some DMN nodes, the amplitude change in the higher-frequency (8-30 Hz) oscillations was less robust in the AD than CH group. These findings highlight relevance of studying short-scale temporal evolution of spontaneous activity in functional neural networks to understanding the AD pathophysiology. Capacity of flexible intrinsic synchronization in the DMN may be crucial for memory and other higher cognitive functions. Our analysis yielded metrics that quantify distinct features of the neural synchrony disorder in AD and may offer sensitive indicators of the neural network health for future investigations.;2213-1582;;;;2018;20;10.1016/j.nicl.2018.05.028;J

Radiomic features obtained from brain MRI have shown a great potential as non-invasive biomarkers for this disease; however, their usefulness has not yet been explored for individual brain regions. In this paper, we hypothesize that distinct regions are affected differently by AD and, thus, that shape or texture changes occurring in separate regions can be expressed by different radiomic features. Moreover, to improve the classification of AD and healthy control (HC) subjects, we propose novel features based on the entropy of the convolution neural network (CNN) feature maps. The proposed approach is evaluated comprehensively using the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies database. Our experiments assess the significance of 45 different radiomic features from individual subcortical regions, via the Wilcoxon test. We also use the random forest classifier to identify the subcortical regions that best differentiate AD patients from HC subjects. Our analysis identified the features derived from several subcortical regions that show significant differences between AD and HC (corrected p < 0.01). Specifically, we found correlation and volume features from the hippocampus (AUC = 81.19% - 84.09%) and amygdala (AUC = 79.70% - 80.27%) regions to have the greatest discriminative power. Furthermore, the proposed entropy features derived from CNN layers yielded the highest classification AUC of 92.58%, compared to 84.45% for the combined radiomic features of all subcortical.

The handheld device and cloud computing resources can provide a seamless interface between patients and physicians, and realtime intracranial EEG can be used to classify brain state (wake/sleep, preseizure, and seizure), implement control policies for electrical stimulation, and track patient health.

An important question in the field is whether and how organization of fiber pathways is affected by disease. It remains unknown whether fibers act as conduits of degenerative pathologies, or if they also degenerate with the gray matter network. This work uses graph theoretic modeling in a longitudinal design to investigate the impact of WM network organization on AD pathology spread. We hypothesize if altered WM network organization mediates disease progression, then a previously published network diffusion model will yield higher prediction accuracy using subject-specific connectomes in place of a healthy template connectome. Neuroimaging data in 124 subjects from ADNI were assessed. Graph topology metrics show preserved network organization in patients compared to controls. Using a published diffusion model, we further probe the effect of network alterations on degeneration spread in AD. We show that choice of connectome does not significantly impact the model's predictive ability. These results suggest that, despite measurable changes in integrity of specific fiber tracts, WM network organization in AD is preserved. Further, there is no difference in the mediation of putative pathology spread between healthy and AD-impaired networks. This conclusion is somewhat at variance with previous results, which report global topological disturbances in AD. Our data indicates the combined effect of edge thresholding, binarization, and inclusion of subcortical regions to network graphs may be responsible for previously reported effects.;1387-2877;1875-8908;;;2018;65;10.3233/JAD-170798;J

Event-related spectral perturbation of 17 MCI patients and 21 healthy control participants was studied with 128-channel EEG during the Sternberg working memory task. Source localization was performed by using the eLORETA software. Among the participants, 13 MCI and 15 control participants underwent a structural brain MRI examination.

Beta ERS correlated significantly with the size of the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and parahippocampal gyrus.

METHODS. A total of 16 MS patients and 26 normal subjects underwent 30 seconds of scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO)-based eye tracking during OCT scanning of retinal layer thickness. Study groups consisted of normal eyes, MS eyes without prior optic neuritis (MS wo ON), and MS eyes with prior optic neuritis (MS + ON). Kernel density estimation quantified fixation instability from the distribution of fixation points on the retina. In MS wo ON eyes, fixation instability was compared to other measures of visual and neurologic function. RESULTS. Fixation instability was increased in MS wo ON eyes (0.062 deg(2)) compared to normal eyes (0.030 deg(2), P = 0.015). A further increase was seen for MS + ON eyes (0.11 deg(2)) compared to MS wo ON (P = 0.04) and normal (P = 0.006) eyes. Fixation instability correlated weakly with ganglion cell layer (GCL) volume and showed no correlation with low-contrast letter acuity, EDSS score, or SDMT score. CONCLUSIONS. Fixation instability reflects the integrity of a widespread neural network germane to visual processing and ocular motor control, and is disturbed in MS. Further study of visual fixation, including the contribution of microsaccades to fixation instability, may provide insight into the localization of fixation abnormalities in MS and introduce innovative and easily measured outcomes for monitoring progression and treatment response.;0146-0404;1552-5783;;JAN;2018;59;10.1167/iovs.17-22391;J

The aim of our study is to evaluate the usefulness of a methodology based on electroencephalography (EEG) to detect AD and MCI. EEG rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects and 37 HC subjects. Artifact-free trials were analyzed by means of several spectral and nonlinear features: relative power in the conventional frequency bands, median frequency, individual alpha frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central tendency measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information. Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The selected features were used to train three different models aimed at classifying the trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP). Afterwards, each subject was automatically allocated in a particular group by applying a trial-based majority vote procedure. After feature extraction, the FCBF method selected the optimal set of features: individual alpha frequency, relative power at delta frequency band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of features, MLP showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a subject is not healthy (sensitivity of 82.35% and positive predictive value of 84.85% for HC vs. all classification task) and whether a subject does not suffer from AD (specificity of 79.41% and negative predictive value of 84.38% for AD vs. all comparison). Our findings suggest that our methodology can help physicians to discriminate AD, MCI and HC.;1099-4300;;;JAN;2018;20;10.3390/e20010035;J

In large human cohort studies, bilateral hippocampal structures are frequently identified and measured to gain insight into human behaviour or genomic variability in neuropsychiatric disorders of interest. Automatic segmentation is performed using various algorithms, with FreeSurfer being a popular option. In this manuscript, we present a method to segment the bilateral hippocampus using a deep-learned appearance model. Deep convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) have shown great success in recent years, due to their ability to learn meaningful features from a mass of training data. Our method relies on the following key novelties: (i) we use a wide and variable training set coming from multiple cohorts (ii) our training labels come in part from the output of the FreeSurfer algorithm, and (iii) we include synthetic data and use a powerful data augmentation scheme. Our method proves to be robust, and it has fast inference (<30s total per subject), with trained model available online (https://github.com/bthyreau/hippodeep). We depict illustrative results and show extensive qualitative and quantitative cohort-wide comparisons with FreeSurfer. Our work demonstrates that deep neural network methods can easily encode, and even improve, existing anatomical knowledge, even when this knowledge exists in algorithmic form. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

D.; Gandhi, Tapan K.";Early Detection of Alzheimer's Disease using Graph Signal Processing on Neuroimaging Data;2018 2ND EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND COMPUTER SCIENCE (EECS 2018);Brain imaging signals obtained using different imaging modalities mostly reside on irregular structures. While most of the classical signal processing methods are designed for signals having a regular structure, a new field of signal processing called Graph Signal Processing (GSP) is growing rapidly which deals with the irregularly structured data. So, GSP has become a natural choice for many brain image analysis applications. In this paper, we consider the problem of detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) in the early stages using fMRI data obtained from ADNI dataset. Firstly, we extract efficient discriminating features from resting state fMRI data using our novel hypothesis which is based on the outcomes of two neurological experiments carried out independently. Then we classify these graph signals by designing a classifier based on recently proposed graph convolutional neural network (GCNN). GCNN is the generalization of convolutional neural network (CNN) to the irregular domain using the concepts of GSP. We constructed brain graphs using different connectivity measures and compared the performance obtained using these graphs to find the best suitable connectivity measure for our application. Our proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art AD detection methods with a classification accuracy of 92.44%. This improvement can be associated with the fact that we first extracted highly discriminating features using graph frequency analysis performed with suitably constructed graphs and then applied properly designed GCNN classifier to classify the input graph signals.;;;978-1-7281-1929-8;;2018;;10.1109/EECS.2018.00062;B

A large number of recent studies has explored pathologic staging of Alzheimer disease using the Mean Diffusivity maps extracted from the Diffusion Tensor Imaging modality. The Deep Neural Networks are seducing tools for classification of subjects' imaging data in computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The major problem here is the lack of a publicly available large amount of training data in both modalities. The lack number of training data yields over-fitting phenomena. We propose a method of a cross-modal transfer learning: from Structural MRI to Diffusion Tensor Imaging modality. Models pre-trained on a structural MRI dataset with domain-depended data augmentation are used as initialization of network parameters to train on Mean Diffusivity data. The method shows a reduction of the over-fitting phenomena, improves learning performance, and thus increases the accuracy of prediction. Classifiers are then fused by a majority vote resulting in augmented scores of classification between Normal Control, Alzheimer Patients and Mild Cognitive Impairment subjects on a subset of ADNI dataset.;2372-9198;;978-1-5386-6060-7;;2018;;10.1109/CBMS.2018.00067;S

The neurodegenerative disease is currently the 6th leading source of death in the US. In 2017 this disease would cost the nation $1.1 trillion. 1 in 3 seniors die in Alzheimer's disease or another dementia. It kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. [14] As of the this papers writing, detecting Alzheimer's is a difficult and time consuming task, but requires brain imaging report and human expertise. Needless to say, this conventional approach to detect Alzheimer's is costly and often error prone. In this paper an alternative approach has been discussed, that is fast, costs less and more reliable. Deep Learning represents the true bleeding edge of Machine Intelligence. Convolutional Neural Networks are biologically inspired Multilayer perceptron specially capable of image processing.

A relative power (RP) metric which quantifies the abnormal EEG pattern 'slowing' has widely been used as a major feature to distinguish HC and MCI, however, the optimal spectral ranges of the RP are influenced by the given dataset. In this study, we proposed the deep neural network based classifier using the RP to fully exploit and recombine the features through its own learning structure. The DNN enhanced the diagnosis results compared to shallow neural network, and enabled to interpret the results as we used the well-known RP features as the domain knowledge.

Deep learning techniques have emerged as a breakthrough tools in analyzing this data. In this paper, we employ a Convolution Neural Network (CNN) on three dimensional structural MRI (sMRI) images of human brain for diagnosis of Alzheimers Disease (AD). The longitudinal images of various subjects are obtained at different time points from the ADNI dataset and subjected to our proposed classification framework. We construct six different datasets based on the number of image slices of GM images with combinations of different time points of scans or only the baseline visit. The classification results obtained from our proposed CNN model shows better performance for Gray Matter (GM) images that are obtained at different time points.

Image decomposition techniques such as Principal Component Analysis have been used for a long time, evolving towards complex non-linear decomposition algorithms. Convolutional networks, and particularly convolutional autoencoders are known for providing high-level abstract features that describe the internal distribution of data in high-dimensional manifolds. In this work, we aim at gaining a deeper understanding the progression of the disease by predicting neuropsychological test outcomes based solely on MRI data. In order to do so, we perform a self-supervised decomposition of the MRI data using a deep convolutional autoencoder. The distribution of features in the z-layer is then used within a neural network based regression, in order to test whether these imaging-derived biomarkers are related to several neuropsychological tests. The prediction of neuropsychological test outcomes achieved R-2 rates up to more than 0.3, with correlations higher than 0.5 in the case of variables heavily linked to neurogedeneration and cognitive state such as the MMSE or the ADAS11 scores.;;;978-1-5386-8494-8;;2018;;;B

Such a state is known as Alzheimer's disease (AD). At this moment, AD remains without a decent cure, and its diagnosis mostly depends on the experience of clinicians; therefore, early diagnostics is critical because AD is progressive and at the beginning, its' development can be slowed down. In this paper, we use a deep learning advances to developed a classification system based on a 3D convolutional neural network for analyzing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data collected for healthy individuals, patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with AD. The dataset of MR images was collected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); spatially normalized with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) toolbox and the skull-stripped for better 3D-CNN (HadNet) training. The backbone of the HadNet architecture is to use stacked convolutions (inception approach) which allows accessing more internal features of the MR image related to the AD. The hyperparameters of the HadNet were fine-tuned through the Bayesian optimization process. The developed classifier does not use segmented brain regions and can automatically process the whole MR image and based on learned features, during training, detect to which class input belongs. In our work, we select three classes: Healthy, MCI and AD; the final 3D-CNN architecture consists of three inception blocks. The HadNet was end-to-end trained using MR brain scans of 530 subjects including 185 AD patients, 185 MCI patients and 160 healthy individuals (HC). Evaluation results show that the trained classifier can distinguish between AD, MCI and HC with accuracy of 88.31% what is a promising classification results.";;;978-1-5386-8494-8;;2018;;;B

Most computer-aided approaches consist of extraction of image features to describe the pathological changes and construction of a classifier for dementia identification. Deep learning technique provides a unified framework for simultaneous representation learning and feature classification, and thus avoids the troublesome hand-crafted feature extraction and feature engineering. In this paper, we propose an ensemble of AlexNets (EnAlexNets) algorithm for early diagnosis of AD using positron emission tomography (PET). We first use the automated anatomical labeling (AAL) cortical parcellation map to detect 62 brain anatomical volumes, then extract image patches in each kind of volumes to fine-tune a pre-trained AlexNet, and finally use the ensemble of those well-performed AlexNets as the classifier. We have evaluated this algorithm against seven existing algorithms on an ADNI dataset. Our results indicate that the proposed EnAlexNets algorithm outperforms those seven algorithms in differentiating AD cases from normal controls.;0302-9743;1611-3349;"978-3-030-02698-1; 978-3-030-02697-4";;2018;11266;10.1007/978-3-030-02698-1_53;S
