abstract={Here we test the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's disease (PD) moves stereotypically along neural networks, possibly reflecting the spread of toxic alpha-synuclein molecules. PD patients (n = 105) and matched controls (n = 57) underwent T1-MRI at entry and 1 year later as part of the Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Over this period, PD patients demonstrate significantly greater cortical thinning than controls in parts of the left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally or structurally) to a "disease reservoir" evaluated by MRI at baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex in PD follows neuronal connectivity and that disease spread to the cortex may herald the onset of cognitive impairment. © 2017 The Author(s).},

abstract={We propose an adaptation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) scheme proposed for segmenting brain lesions with considerable mass-effect, to segment white matter hyperintensities (WMH) characteristic of brains with none or mild vascular pathology in routine clinical brain magnetic resonance images (MRI). This is a rather difficult segmentation problem because of the small area (i.e., volume) of the WMH and their similarity to non-pathological brain tissue. We investigate the effectiveness of the 2D CNN scheme by comparing its performance against those obtained from another deep learning approach: Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM), two conventional machine learning approaches: Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF), and a public toolbox: Lesion Segmentation Tool (LST), all reported to be useful for segmenting WMH in MRI. We also introduce a way to incorporate spatial information in convolution level of CNN for WMH segmentation named global spatial information (GSI). Analysis of covariance corroborated known associations between WMH progression, as assessed by all methods evaluated, and demographic and clinical data. Deep learning algorithms outperform conventional machine learning algorithms by excluding MRI artefacts and pathologies that appear similar to WMH. Our proposed approach of incorporating GSI also successfully helped CNN to achieve better automatic WMH segmentation regardless of network's settings tested. The mean Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) values for LST-LGA, SVM, RF, DBM, CNN and CNN-GSI were 0.2963, 0.1194, 0.1633, 0.3264, 0.5359 and 5389 respectively. © 2018},

abstract={For effective treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD), it is important to identify subjects who are most likely to exhibit rapid cognitive decline. We aimed to develop an automatic image interpretation system based on a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) which can accurately predict future cognitive decline in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) patients using flurodeoxyglucose and florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET). PET images of 139 patients with AD, 171 patients with MCI and 182 normal subjects obtained from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database were used. Deep CNN was trained using 3-dimensional PET volumes of AD and normal controls as inputs. Manually defined image feature extraction such as quantification using predefined region-of-interests was unnecessary for our approach. Furthermore, it used minimally processed images without spatial normalization which has been commonly used in conventional quantitative analyses. Cognitive outcome of MCI subjects was predicted using this network. The prediction accuracy of the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD was compared with the conventional feature-based quantification approach. Accuracy of prediction (84.2%) for conversion to AD in MCI patients outperformed conventional feature-based quantification approaches. ROC analyses revealed that performance of CNN-based approach was significantly higher than that of the conventional quantification methods (p < 0.05). Output scores of the network were strongly correlated with the longitudinal change in cognitive measurements (p < 0.05). These results show the feasibility of deep learning as a practical tool for developing predictive neuroimaging biomarker. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases with a commonly seen prodromal mild cognitive impairment (MCI) phase where memory loss is the main complaint progressively worsening with behavior issues and poor self-care. However, not all individuals clinically diagnosed with MCI progress to AD. A fraction of subjects with MCI either progress to non-AD dementia or remain stable at the MCI stage without progressing to dementia. Although a curative treatment of AD is currently unavailable, it is extremely important to correctly identify the individuals in the MCI phase that will go on to develop AD so that they may benefit from a curative treatment when one becomes available in the near future. At the same time, it would be highly desirable to also correctly identify those in the MCI phase that do not have AD pathology so they may be spared from unnecessary pharmocologic interventions that, at best, may provide them no benefit, and at worse, could further harm them with adverse side-effects. Additionally, it may be easier and simpler to identify the cause of the cognitive impairment in these non-AD cases, and hence proper identification of prodromal AD will be of benefit to these individuals as well. Fluorodeoxy glucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) captures the metabolic activity of the brain, and this imaging modality has been reported to identify changes related to AD prior to the onset of structural changes. Prior work on designing classifier using FDG-PET imaging has been promising. Since deep-learning has recently emerged as a powerful tool to mine features and use them for accurate labeling of the group membership of given images, we propose a novel deep-learning framework using FDG-PET metabolism imaging to identify subjects at the MCI stage with presymptomatic AD and discriminate them from other subjects with MCI (non-AD / non-progressive). Our multiscale deep neural network obtained 82.51% accuracy of classification just using measures from a single modality (FDG-PET metabolism data) outperforming other comparable FDG-PET classifiers published in the recent literature. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: To provide an up-to-date systematic review of the characteristics, methodology and findings of studies that have investigated the neurochemistry of agitation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Methods: Electronic databases were searched for published peer-reviewed articles which provided data on any neurotransmitter system in relation to agitation in AD. Screening of titles and abstracts and data extraction from full texts were conducted in duplicate. Results: Forty-five studies were included. Monoamines (serotonin, dopamine and noradrenaline) were most commonly investigated. A variety of methods were used to investigate the neurochemistry underlying agitation in AD and, although there were several conflicting findings, there was evidence of serotonergic deficit, relatively preserved dopaminergic function and compensatory overactivity of postsynaptic noradrenergic neurons in agitation in AD. Conclusions: Disruption of the dynamic balance between multiple neurotransmitter systems could impair functional neural networks involved in affective regulation and executive function. Differences in study design and methodology may have contributed to conflicting findings. Future studies that overcome these limitations (e.g. using standardized criteria to define agitation) and employ neuroimaging methods such as MRI/PET to investigate specific neural networks are needed to clarify the role of neurotransmitter alterations in these patients. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the APOE4 genotype is associated with accelerated memory decline, likely due to the impact of neuropathology on main cerebral networks required for successful memory retrieval and/or to decreased capacity for recruiting secondary networks that might compensate for that brain damage. Here, we tested this hypothesis in twenty-six healthy older adults and thirty-four MCI patients, of which sixteen were APOE4 carriers. Compared to controls, MCI showed hippocampal volume reduction, cortical thinning in frontal, temporal and parietal regions, and dysfunctional EEG oscillations across fronto-temporal networks. But importantly, APOE4 status was the critical factor in determining the impact of temporal lobe degeneration on memory in MCI individuals. Specifically, path analyses revealed that hippocampal damage in MCI was responsible for memory deterioration in APOE4 carriers, a relationship mediated by the serial intervention of three related factors in noncarriers. Temporal cortical thickness (first mediator) accounted for activation of functional networks through synchronized theta activity across temporal regions (second mediator), which, in turn, coordinated memory reactivation through desynchronized alpha/beta activity across sensorimotor areas (third mediator). Results revealed that, contrary to APOE4-carrier patients, noncarriers are successful in recruiting secondary cortical networks to improve memory performance as long as the integrity and functionality of the temporal lobe is preserved, a fact primarily dependent on hippocampal degeneration. © 2018},

Immunohistochemistry is a simple and powerful technique that can also be applied to archival tissues. However, staining of brain vessels on paraffin sections has been challenging. In this study, we developed an optimized method that can be used in paraffin-embedded mouse and human brain tissues derived from healthy controls and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. We subsequently showed that this method is fully compatible with the detection of glial cells and key markers of Alzheimer’s disease including amyloid beta and phosphorylated Tau protein. Furthermore, we observed that the length of microvasculature in hippocampus of TgCRND8 Alzheimer’s disease mouse model is reduced, which is correlated with the decreased blood flow in hippocampus as determined by arterial spin labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, we determined that the microvasculature length in two other Alzheimer’s disease mouse models, APP and PS1 double-transgenic mice and P301S Tau-transgenic mice, is also shortened in the dentate gyrus. Thus, we have established a new, simple and robust method to characterize the brain vasculature in the mouse and human brain. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={An early intervention of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is highly essential due to the fact that this neuro degenerative disease generates major life-threatening issues, especially memory loss among patients in society. Moreover, categorizing NC (Normal Control), MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment) and AD early in course allows the patients to experience benefits from new treatments. Therefore, it is important to construct a reliable classification technique to discriminate the patients with or without AD from the bio medical imaging modality. Hence, we developed a novel FCM based Weighted Probabilistic Neural Network (FWPNN) classification algorithm and analyzed the brain images related to structural MRI modality for better discrimination of class labels. Initially our proposed framework begins with brain image normalization stage. In this stage, ROI regions related to Hippo-Campus (HC) and Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC) from the brain images are extracted using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) method. Subsequently, nineteen highly relevant AD related features are selected through Multiple-criterion feature selection method. At last, our novel FWPNN classification algorithm is imposed to remove suspicious samples from the training data with an end goal to enhance the classification performance. This newly developed classification algorithm combines both the goodness of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. The experimental validation is carried out with the ADNI subset and then to the Bordex-3 city dataset. Our proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of about 98.63%, 95.4%, 96.4% in terms of classification with AD vs NC, MCI vs NC and AD vs MCI. The experimental results suggest that the removal of noisy samples from the training data can enhance the decision generation process of the expert systems. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Background: Hippocampal atrophy is a supportive feature for the diagnosis of probable Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even for an expert neuroradiologist, tracing the hippocampus and measuring its volume is a time consuming and extremely challenging task. Accordingly, the development of reliable fully-automated segmentation algorithms is of paramount importance. Materials and methods: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and the robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network (HUMAN) segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD diagnosis. For these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects and their T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The cohort included 145 controls (CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects and 94 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the baseline, repeat, 12 and 24 month follow-up scans were available. Results: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3% precision; volume measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC) AUC1=0.08±0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler effects present in MCI subjects, AUC2=0.76±0.05. The algorithm is stable and reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans. Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN, can effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become a useful tool for other neuroimaging applications. © 2018 The Author(s).},

abstract={Feature representations extracted from hippocampus in magnetic resonance (MR) images are widely used in computer-aided Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis, and thus accurate segmentation for the hippocampus has been remaining an active research topic. Previous studies for hippocampus segmentation require either human annotation which is tedious and error-prone or pre-processing MR images via time-consuming non-linear registration. Although many automatic segmentation approaches have been proposed, their performance is often limited by the small size of hippocampus and complex confounding information around the hippocampus. In particular, human-engineered features extracted from segmented hippocampus regions (e.g., the volume of the hippocampus) are essential for brain disease diagnosis, while these features are independent of diagnosis models, leading to sub-optimal performance. To address these issues, we propose a multi-task deep learning (MDL) method for joint hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression using MR images. The prominent advantages of our MDL method lie on that we don’t need any time-consuming non-linear registration for pre-processing MR images, and features generated by MDL are consistent with subsequent diagnosis models. Specifically, we first align all MR images onto a standard template, followed by a patch extraction process to approximately locate hippocampus regions in the template space. Using image patches as input data, we develop a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN) for joint hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression. The proposed CNN network contains two subnetworks, including 1) a U-Net with a Dice-like loss function for hippocampus segmentation, and 2) a convolutional neural network with a mean squared loss function for clinical regression. Note that these two subnetworks share a part of network parameters, to exploit the inherent association between these two tasks. We evaluate the proposed method on 407 subjects with MRI data from baseline Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The experimental results suggest that our MDL method achieves promising results in both tasks of hippocampus segmentation and clinical score regression, compared with several state-of-the-art methods. © 2018 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive loss of memory and cognitive deficit. The observed amnesia in the early stages of AD is suggested to be a retrieval problem, rather than encoding and consolidation deficit. According to the cholinergic hypothesis of AD, scopolamine is used to induce an animal model of amnesia. Howbeit the effect of scopolamine on memory retrieval is contradictory. This study aimed to assess the effect of scopolamine on passive avoidance memory retrieval. Additionally according to the reported changes of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MAPKs (ERK, P38 and JNK) in AD pathology the hippocampal contents of these proteins were determined. Male NMRI mice weighing 20–25 g were trained in passive avoidance apparatus. The drug or its vehicle was injected 24 h after training (30 min before retention test). The hippocampal tissue was isolated and western blot analysis was done for MMP-2, MMP-9 and MAPKs (ERK, P38 and JNK). The results indicated that scopolamine (1 mg/kg) disrupts passive avoidance memory retrieval. This scopolamine treatment resulted in hippocampal MMP-2 and MMP-9 decline while increased MAPKs in the hippocampus. These results suggest that cholinergic system has an important role in learnt memory retrieval. It might also suggest the positive role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in this phase of memory while propose that MAPKs affect negatively the reactivation of memory which is compatible with MAPKs activation in AD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize hand-crafted (e.g., voxel-based or region-based) biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images as feature representations. However, these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest (ROIs) defined by experts. In addition, because of the possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a landmark based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) dataset. Experimental results of both tasks of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval demonstrate that the proposed LDFL method improves the performance of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval.

Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={In conventional Magnetic Resonance (MR) image based methods, two stages are often involved to capture brain structural information for disease diagnosis, i.e., 1) manually partitioning each MR image into a number of regions-of-interest (ROIs), and 2) extracting pre-defined features from each ROI for diagnosis with a certain classifier. However, these pre-defined features often limit the performance of the diagnosis, due to challenges in 1) defining the ROIs and 2) extracting effective disease-related features. In this paper, we propose a landmark-based deep multi-instance learning (LDMIL) framework for brain disease diagnosis. Specifically, we first adopt a data-driven learning approach to discover disease-related anatomical landmarks in the brain MR images, along with their nearby image patches. Then, our LDMIL framework learns an end-to-end MR image classifier for capturing both the local structural information conveyed by image patches located by landmarks and the global structural information derived from all detected landmarks. We have evaluated our proposed framework on 1526 subjects from three public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and MIRIAD), and the experimental results show that our framework can achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Dementia has become a social problem in the aging society of advanced countries. Currently, 46.8 million people have dementia worldwide, and that figure is predicted to increase threefold to 130 million people by 2050. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. The cost of care for AD patients in 2015 was 818 billion US dollars and is expected to increase dramatically in the future, due to the increasing number of patients as a result of the aging society. However, it is still very difficult to cure AD; thus, the detection of AD is crucial. This study proposes the use of machine learning to detect AD using brain image data, with the goal of reducing the cost of diagnosing and caring for AD patients. Most machine learning algorithms rely on good feature representations, which are commonly obtained manually and require domain experts to provide guidance. Feature extraction is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task. In contrast, the 3D Convolutional Neural Network (3DCNN) automatically learns feature representation from images and is not greatly affected by image processing. However, the performance of CNN depends on its layer architecture. This study proposes a novel 3DCNN architecture for MRI image diagnosis of AD. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.},

abstract={The discrimination of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal form (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) from cognitively healthy control (HC) subjects is crucial since the treatment is more effective in the first stages of the dementia. The aim of our study is to evaluate the usefulness of a methodology based on electroencephalography (EEG) to detect AD and MCI. EEG rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI subjects and 37 HC subjects. Artifact-free trials were analyzed by means of several spectral and nonlinear features: relative power in the conventional frequency bands, median frequency, individual alpha frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central tendency measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information. Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The selected features were used to train three different models aimed at classifying the trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural network (MLP). Afterwards, each subject was automatically allocated in a particular group by applying a trial-based majority vote procedure. After feature extraction, the FCBF method selected the optimal set of features: individual alpha frequency, relative power at delta frequency band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of features, MLP showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a subject is not healthy (sensitivity of 82.35% and positive predictive value of 84.85% for HC vs. all classification task) and whether a subject does not suffer from AD (specificity of 79.41% and negative predictive value of 84.38% for AD vs. all comparison). Our findings suggest that our methodology can help physicians to discriminate AD, MCI and HC. © 2018 by the authors.},

abstract={Introduction Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients exhibit temporally graded memory loss with remote memories remaining more intact than recent memories. It is unclear whether this temporal pattern is observable in clinically normal adults with amyloid pathology (i.e. preclinical AD). Methods Participants were asked to recall the names of famous figures most prominent recently (famous after 1990) and remotely (famous from 1960–1980) and were provided with a phonemic cue to ensure that memory failure was not purely due to verbal retrieval weaknesses. In addition, participants identified line drawings of objects. Clinically normal older adults (n = 125) were identified as amyloid β positive or negative (Aβ+/−) using Pittsburgh compound B positron emission tomography. The relationship between Aβ+/− and recall of remote and recent famous face-names and objects was examined using repeated measures analyses and general linear models controlling for demographics and media usage. Results When provided with a phonemic cue, Aβ+ participants recalled the names of fewer recent famous faces compared with Aβ− participants. However, recall of remote famous face-names and objects did not differ by Aβ group. Discussion Relative sparing of remotely learned information compared with recently learned information is (1) detectable in the preclinical stages of AD and (2) related to amyloid pathology. Both this temporal gradient and assessment of person-centered rather than object-centered semantic information may be particularly meaningful for tracking early memory changes in the AD trajectory. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Purpose: This work presents an automatic characterization of the Alzheimer's disease describing the illness as a multidirectional departure from a baseline defining the control state, being these directions determined by a distance between functional-equivalent anatomical regions. Methods: After a brain parcellation, a region is described by its histogram of gray levels, and the Earth mover's distance establishes how close or far these regions are. The medoid of the control group is set as the reference and any brain is characterized by its set of distances to this medoid. Evaluation: This hypothesis was assessed by separating groups of patients with mild Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment from control subjects, using a subset of the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database. An additional experiment evaluated the method generalization and consisted in training with the OASIS data and testing with the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's disease (MIRIAD) database. Results: Classification between controls and patients with AD resulted in an equal error rate of 0.1 (90% of sensitivity and specificity at the same time). The automatic ranking of regions resulting is in strong agreement with those regions described as important in clinical practice. Classification with different databases results in a sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 91%. Conclusions: This method automatically finds out a multidimensional expression of the AD, which is directly related to the anatomical changes in specific areas such as the hippocampus, the amygdala, the planum temporale, and thalamus. © 2018 Published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The importance of the hippocampus in the study of several neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease makes it a structure of great interest in neuroimaging. However, few segmentation methods have been proposed to measure its subfields due to its complex structure and the lack of high resolution magnetic resonance (MR) data. In this work, we present a new pipeline for automatic hippocampus subfield segmentation using two available hippocampus subfield delineation protocols that can work with both high and standard resolution data. The proposed method is based on multi-atlas label fusion technology that benefits from a novel multi-contrast patch match search process (using high resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted images). The proposed method also includes as post-processing a new neural network-based error correction step to minimize systematic segmentation errors. The method has been evaluated on both high and standard resolution images and compared to other state-of-the-art methods showing better results in terms of accuracy and execution time. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Computerized healthcare has undergone rapid development thanks to the advances in medical imaging and machine learning technologies. Especially, recent progress on deep learning opens a new era for multimedia based clinical decision support. In this paper, we use deep learning with brain network and clinical relevant text information to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer&#x0027;s Disease (AD). The clinical relevant text information includes age, gender and ApoE gene of the subject. The brain network is constructed by computing functional connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data. A targeted autoencoder network is built to distinguish normal aging from mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of AD. The proposed method reveals discriminative brain network features effectively and provides a reliable classifier for AD detection. Compared to traditional classifiers based on R-fMRI time series data, 31.21% improvement of the prediction accuracy on average is achieved by the proposed deep learning method, and standard deviation reduces by 51.23% on average that means our prediction model is more stable and reliable compared to traditional methods. Our work excavates deep learning&#x0027;s advantages of classifying high-dimensional multimedia data in medical services, and could help predict and prevent AD at an early stage. IEEE},

abstract={In neuroimaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the brain. The degree of correlation of the BOLD signal in spatially independent regions of the brain defines the functional connectivity of those regions. During a cognitive fMRI task, a psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis can be used to examine changes in the functional connectivity during specific contexts defined by the cognitive task. An example of such a task is one that engages the memory system, asking participants to learn pairs of unrelated words (encoding) and recall the second word in a pair when presented with the first word (retrieval). In the present study, we used this type of associative memory task and a generalized PPI (gPPI) analysis to compare changes in hippocampal connectivity in older adults who are carriers of the Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk factor apolipoprotein-E epsilon-4 (APOEε4). Specifically, we show that the functional connectivity of subregions of the hippocampus changes during encoding and retrieval, the two active phases of the associative memory task. Context-dependent changes in functional connectivity of the hippocampus were significantly different in carriers of APOEε4 compared to non-carriers. PPI analyses make it possible to examine changes in functional connectivity, distinct from univariate main effects, and to compare these changes across groups. Thus, a PPI analysis may reveal complex task effects in specific cohorts that traditional univariate methods do not capture. PPI analyses cannot, however, determine directionality or causality between functionally connected regions. Nevertheless, PPI analyses provide powerful means for generating specific hypotheses regarding functional relationships, which can be tested using causal models. As the brain is increasingly described in terms of connectivity and networks, PPI is an important method for analyzing fMRI task data that is in line with the current conception of the human brain. © 2017 Journal of Visualized Experiments.},

abstract={The rise of neuroimaging in research and clinical practice, together with the development of new machine learning techniques has strongly encouraged the Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of different diseases and disorders. However, these algorithms are often tested in proprietary datasets to which the access is limited and, therefore, a direct comparison between CAD procedures is not possible. Furthermore, the sample size is often small for developing accurate machine learning methods. Multi-center initiatives are currently a very useful, although limited, tool in the recruitment of large populations and standardization of CAD evaluation. Conversely, we propose a brain image synthesis procedure intended to generate a new image set that share characteristics with an original one. Our system focuses on nuclear imaging modalities such as PET or SPECT brain images. We analyze the dataset by applying PCA to the original dataset, and then model the distribution of samples in the projected eigenbrain space using a Probability Density Function (PDF) estimator. Once the model has been built, we can generate new coordinates on the eigenbrain space belonging to the same class, which can be then projected back to the image space. The system has been evaluated on different functional neuroimaging datasets assessing the: resemblance of the synthetic images with the original ones, the differences between them, their generalization ability and the independence of the synthetic dataset with respect to the original. The synthetic images maintain the differences between groups found at the original dataset, with no significant differences when comparing them to real-world samples. Furthermore, they featured a similar performance and generalization capability to that of the original dataset. These results prove that these images are suitable for standardizing the evaluation of CAD pipelines, and providing data augmentation in machine learning systems-e.g. in deep learning-, or even to train future professionals at medical school. © 2017 Martnez-Murcia, Górriz, Ramírez, Illán, Segovia, Castillo-Barnes, and Salas-Gonzalez for the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.},

abstract={Episodic memory is a conglomerate of autobiographical events, times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, where, why knowledge that can be explicitly stated. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred at a particular time and place. An emotion plays a pivotal role in the formation of memory; it can either enhance memory or impair cognition. Memory plays a crucial role in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Dementia. Analyzing the retrieval of memory helps in better understanding of the disorders. The main aim of this paper is to find an integrated relationship between different regions of brain and the episodic memory recall, through functional connectivity parameters such as coherence, direct transfer function (DTF), partial directed coherence (PDC) for four different emotions namely fear, happy, anger and gratefulness. It was observed that there was a significant variation in DTF and PDC of temporal and frontopolar regions during retrieval of angry and fear events in theta and beta bands. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The paper describes the research made toward im-proving medical case retrieval for Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease (AD). Our approach considers using Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) as an input for the search. To improve the retrieval process we used longitudinal information extracted from different sets of scans ac-quired at different time points and automatically extracted de-scriptors to represent input images. All experiments were per-formed with and without quality control (QC) to determine the in-fluence of the errors caused by the automated processing to the results relevance. For the experiments, a total of 267 subjects from the Alzheimer&#x2019;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database with available scans at baseline, the 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups were selected. The obtained results showed that the selection of the time points for extraction of the longitudinal information influences the retrieval performance. Results also showed that not all automatically generated descriptors lead to im-provement of the results. Longitudinal volume changes provide the most relevant representation. Adding QC phase in the experi-ments leads to improvements in all examined scenarios. The re-sults showed that the most frequently automatically selected fea-tures are common semantic markers for AD.

abstract={Older adults experience impairments in episodic memory, ranging from mild to clinically significant. Given the critical role of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) in episodic memory, age-related changes in MTL structure and function may partially account for individual differences in memory. Using ultra-high-field 7T structural MRI and high-resolution 3T functional MRI (hr-fMRI), we evaluated MTL subfield thickness and function in older adults representing a spectrum of cognitive health. Participants performed an associative memory task during hr-fMRI in which they encoded and later retrieved face-name pairs. Motivated by prior research, we hypothesized that differences in performance would be explained by the following: (i) entorhinal cortex (ERC) and CA1 apical neuropil layer [CA1-stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM)] thickness, and (ii) activity in ERC and the dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3 region. Regression analyses revealed that this combination of factors significantly accounted for variability in memory performance. Among these metrics, CA1-SRLM thickness was positively associated with memory, whereas DG/CA3 retrieval activity was negatively associated with memory. Furthermore, including structural and functional metrics in the same model better accounted for performance than did single-modality models. These results advance the understanding of how independent but converging influences of both MTL subfield structure and function contribute to age-related memory impairment, complementing findings in the rodent and human postmortem literatures. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Brain extraction or whole brain segmentation is an important first step in many of the neuroimage analysis pipelines. The accuracy and the robustness of brain extraction, therefore, are crucial for the accuracy of the entire brain analysis process. The state-of-the-art brain extraction techniques rely heavily on the accuracy of alignment or registration between brain atlases and query brain anatomy, and/or make assumptions about the image geometry, and therefore have limited success when these assumptions do not hold or image registration fails. With the aim of designing an accurate, learning-based, geometry-independent, and registration-free brain extraction tool, in this paper, we present a technique based on an auto-context convolutional neural network (CNN), in which intrinsic local and global image features are learned through 2-D patches of different window sizes. We consider two different architectures: 1) a voxelwise approach based on three parallel 2-D convolutional pathways for three different directions (axial, coronal, and sagittal) that implicitly learn 3-D image information without the need for computationally expensive 3-D convolutions and 2) a fully convolutional network based on the U-net architecture. Posterior probability maps generated by the networks are used iteratively as context information along with the original image patches to learn the local shape and connectedness of the brain to extract it from non-brain tissue. The brain extraction results we have obtained from our CNNs are superior to the recently reported results in the literature on two publicly available benchmark data sets, namely, LPBA40 and OASIS, in which we obtained the Dice overlap coefficients of 97.73% and 97.62%, respectively. Significant improvement was achieved via our auto-context algorithm. Furthermore, we evaluated the performance of our algorithm in the challenging problem of extracting arbitrarily oriented fetal brains in reconstructed fetal brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. In this application, our voxelwise auto-context CNN performed much better than the other methods (Dice coefficient: 95.97%), where the other methods performed poorly due to the non-standard orientation and geometry of the fetal brain in MRI. Through training, our method can provide accurate brain extraction in challenging applications. This, in turn, may reduce the problems associated with image registration in segmentation tasks. © 1982-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Network-sensitive neuroimaging methods have been used to characterize large-scale brain network degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and its prodrome. However, few studies have investigated the combined effect of Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease on brain network degeneration. Our study sought to examine the intrinsic functional connectivity and structural covariance network changes in 235 prodromal and clinical Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease. We focused particularly on two higher-order cognitive networks - the default mode network and the executive control network. We found divergent functional connectivity and structural covariance patterns in Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease. Alzheimer's disease patients without cerebrovascular disease, but not Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease, showed reductions in posterior default mode network functional connectivity. By comparison, while both groups exhibited parietal reductions in executive control network functional connectivity, only Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease showed increases in frontal executive control network connectivity. Importantly, these distinct executive control network changes were recapitulated in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease. Across Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease, higher default mode network functional connectivity z-scores correlated with greater hippocampal volumes while higher executive control network functional connectivity z-scores correlated with greater white matter changes. In parallel, only Alzheimer's disease patients without cerebrovascular disease showed increased default mode network structural covariance, while only Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease showed increased executive control network structural covariance compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate the differential neural network structural and functional changes in Alzheimer's disease with and without cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that the underlying pathology of Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease might differ from those without cerebrovascular disease and reflect a combination of more severe cerebrovascular disease and less severe Alzheimer's disease network degeneration phenotype. © The Author (2017).

abstract={Introduction To facilitate radiotracers' development, a screening methodology using a biomathematical model and clinical usefulness index (CUI) was proposed to evaluate radiotracers' diagnostic capabilities. Methods A total of 31 amyloid positron emission tomography radiotracers were evaluated. A previously developed biomathematical model was used to simulate 1000 standardized uptake value ratios with population and noise simulations, which were used to determine the integrated receiver operating characteristics curve (Az), effect size (Es), and standardized uptake value ratio (Sr) of conditions-pairs of healthy control–mild cognitive impaired and mild cognitive impaired–Alzheimer's disease. CUI was obtained from the product of averaged Az(Az¯), Es(Es¯), and Sr(Sr¯). Results The relationships of Az¯, Es¯, and Sr¯ with CUI were different, suggesting that they assessed different radiotracer properties. The combination of Az, Es, and Sr complemented each other and resulted in CUI of 0.10 to 5.72, with clinically applied amyloid positron emission tomography radiotracers having CUI greater than 3.0. Discussion The CUI rankings of clinically applied radiotracers were close to their reported clinical results, attesting to the applicability of the screening methodology. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Modern pattern recognition and artificial intelligence systems can help in providing better health care and medical solutions. The performance of human diagnosis degrades due to fatigue, cognitive biases, systems faults, and distractions. However, artificial intelligence based diagnosis systems are less error prone and give safe support to clinicians in detection and decision making. This work presents a smart and reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible early stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease and leads to severe memory loss and inability to cope with daily life tasks. The diagnosis of AD from structural images requires great skill and is challenging for human diagnostics. The presented framework is based on deep learning and detects Alzheimer's and its initial stages accurately from structural MRI scans. The framework analyzes four different classes simultaneously in a single setup. The testing accuracy of diagnosis obtained by the method is 98.88%. Experiments are also performed on binary data and transfer learning is applied for multiclass classification achieving 99.7% accuracy. Once a good trained model is obtained, the decision for an unseen test scan is given within a few seconds. These models are free from the factors that are responsible for causing human diagnostic errors. Therefore, these models are dependable and can provide much faster diagnosis. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={As a key dimensionality reduction technique in pattern recognition, feature selection has been widely used in information retrieval, text classification and genetic data analysis. In recent years, structural information contained in samples for guiding feature selection has become a new hot spot in machine learning field. Although tremendous feature selection methods have been developed, less important features are still used to construct the structure in those conventional structure based feature selection approaches. In this paper, we propose a new filter-type feature selection method called iterative sparsity score, which is independent of any learning algorithm. The proposed method can preserve the structural information by sparse representation, which can be efficiently solved by a ℓ1-norm minimization problem. To exclude data noise, at one time we discard last m features and iteratively optimize the ℓ1-norm minimization problem. We perform clustering and classification experiments on numerous bench mark datasets. Furthermore, its extension for multimodal data is also developed. We adopt the multi-modality alzheimer's disease data for classification to evaluate the extended method. The experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed methods compared with several popular feature selection approaches. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={The goal of this review is to describe in what ways feedback or adaptive stimulation may be delivered and adjusted based on relevant biomarkers. Specific treatment mechanisms underlying therapeutic brain stimulation remain unclear, in spite of the demonstrated efficacy in a number of nervous system diseases. Brain stimulation appears to exert widespread influence over specific neural networks that are relevant to specific disease entities. In awake patients, activation or suppression of these neural networks can be assessed by either symptom alleviation (i.e., tremor, rigidity, seizures) or physiological criteria, which may be predictive of expected symptomatic treatment. Secondary verification of network activation through specific biomarkers that are linked to symptomatic disease improvement may be useful for several reasons. For example, these biomarkers could aid optimal intraoperative localization, possibly improve efficacy or efficiency (i.e., reduced power needs), and provide long-term adaptive automatic adjustment of stimulation parameters. Possible biomarkers for use in portable or implanted devices span from ongoing physiological brain activity, evoked local field potentials (LFPs), and intermittent pathological activity, to wearable devices, biochemical, blood flow, optical, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes, temperature changes, or optogenetic signals. First, however, potential biomarkers must be correlated directly with symptom or disease treatment and network activation. Although numerous biomarkers are under consideration for a variety of stimulation indications the feasibility of these approaches has yet to be fully determined. Particularly, there are critical questions whether the use of adaptive systems can improve efficacy over continuous stimulation, facilitate adjustment of stimulation interventions and improve our understanding of the role of abnormal network function in disease mechanisms. © 2017 Hoang, Cassar, Grill and Turner.},

abstract={Although neurons attract the most attention in neurobiology, our current knowledge of neural circuit can only partially explain the neurological and psychiatric conditions of the brain. Thus, it is also important to consider the influence of brain interstitial system (ISS), which refers to the space among neural cells and capillaries. The ISS is the major compartment of the brain microenvironment that provides the immediate accommodation space for neural cells, and it occupies 15% to 20% of the total brain volume. The brain ISS is a dynamic and complex space connecting the vascular system and neural networks and it plays crucial roles in substance transport and signal transmission among neurons. Investigation of the brain ISS can provide new perspectives for understanding brain architecture and function and for exploring new strategies to treat brain disorders. This review discussed the anatomy of the brain ISS under both physiological and pathological conditions, biophysical modeling of the brain ISS and in vivo measurement and imaging techniques, including recent findings on brain ISS divisions. Moreover, the implications of ISS knowledge for basic neuroscience and clinical applications are addressed. © 2016 The Authors},

Electroencephalography (EEG) is a tool capable of measuring the dynamics of the brain's neural networks, and is thus an important means in analysis and understanding of aMCI. In this proof-of-concept study, we compared the brain activation patterns of ten aMCI subjects with those of four healthy subjects during sleep by employing a 64-channel EEG data collection system. The power spectrum was analyzed to identify sleep stages, while spectral topography and source imaging techniques were employed to study the fluctuating patterns of the brain. Results of this study show an increase in activation power across all sleep stages in the delta and theta frequency bands alongside a decrease in alpha band activity for aMCI subjects. Source imaging analysis of the resting EEG identified default mode network, which becomes decoupled as sleep stages deepen. In the proof-of-concept study, our exploratory analysis demonstrated the feasibility of imaging dynamic network organization using EEG in aMCI. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The goal of this study is to introduce a nonparametric technique for predicting conversion from Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI)-To-Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progression of a slowly progressing disease such as AD benefits from the use of longitudinal data; however, research till now is limited due to the insufficient patient data and short follow-up time. A small dataset size invalidates the estimation of underlying disease progression model; hence, a supervised nonparametric method is proposed. While depicting a real-world setting, longitudinal data of three years are employed for training, whereas only the baseline visit's data is used for validation. The train set is preprocessed for extraction of two dense clusters representing the subjects who remain stable at MCI or progress to AD after three years of the baseline visit. Similarity between these clusters and the test point is calculated in Euclidean space. Multiple features from two modalities of biomarkers, i.e., neuropsychological measures (NM) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry are also analyzed. Due to the limited MCI dataset size (NM: 145, MRI: 52, NM+MRI: 29), leave-one-out cross validation setup is employed for performance evaluation. The algorithm performance is noted for both unimodal case and bimodal cases. Superior performance (accuracy: 89.66%, sensitivity: 87.50%, specificity: 92.31%, precision: 93.33%) is delivered by multivariate predictors. Three notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Longitudinal data are more powerful than the temporal data, 2) MRI is a better predictor of MCI-To-AD conversion than NM, and 3) multivariate predictors outperform single predictor models. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating age-related neurodegenerative disorder. Accurate identification of individuals at risk is complicated as AD shares cognitive and brain features with aging. We applied linked independent component analysis (LICA) on three complementary measures of gray matter structure: cortical thickness, area and gray matter density of 137 AD, 78 mild (MCI) and 38 subjective cognitive impairment patients, and 355 healthy adults aged 18–78 years to identify dissociable multivariate morphological patterns sensitive to age and diagnosis. Using the lasso classifier, we performed group classification and prediction of cognition and age at different age ranges to assess the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of the LICA patterns in relation to AD, as well as early and late healthy aging. Three components showed high sensitivity to the diagnosis and cognitive status of AD, with different relationships with age: one reflected an anterior-posterior gradient in thickness and gray matter density and was uniquely related to diagnosis, whereas the other two, reflecting widespread cortical thickness and medial temporal lobe volume, respectively, also correlated significantly with age. Repeating the LICA decomposition and between-subject analysis on ADNI data, including 186 AD, 395 MCI and 220 age-matched healthy controls, revealed largely consistent brain patterns and clinical associations across samples. Classification results showed that multivariate LICA-derived brain characteristics could be used to predict AD and age with high accuracy (area under ROC curve up to 0.93 for classification of AD from controls). Comparison between classifiers based on feature ranking and feature selection suggests both common and unique feature sets implicated in AD and aging, and provides evidence of distinct age-related differences in early compared to late aging. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Anesthetics produce unconsciousness by modulating ion channels that control neuronal excitability. Research has shown that specific GABAA receptor (GABAAR) subtypes in particular regions of the central nervous system contribute to different hyperpolarizing conductances, and behaviorally to distinct components of the anesthetized state. The expression of these receptors on the neuron cell surface, and thus the strength of inhibitory neurotransmission, is dynamically regulated by intracellular trafficking mechanisms. Pharmacologic or activity-based perturbations to these regulatory systems have been implicated in pathology of several neurological conditions, and can alter the individual response to anesthesia. Furthermore, studies are beginning to uncover how anesthetic exposure itself elicits enduring changes in subcellular physiology, including the processes that regulate ion channel trafficking. Here, we review the mechanisms that determine GABAAR surface expression, and elaborate on influences germane to anesthesia and emergence. We address known trafficking differences between the intrasynaptic receptors that mediate phasic current and the extra-synaptic receptors mediating tonic current. We also describe neurophysiologic consequences and network-level abnormalities in brain function that result from receptor trafficking aberrations. We hypothesize that the relationship between commonly used anesthetic agents and GABAAR surface expression has direct consequences on mature functioning neural networks and by extension ultimately influence the outcome of patients that undergo general anesthesia. Rational design of new anesthetics, anesthetic techniques, EEG-based monitoring strategies, or emergence treatments will need to take these effects into consideration. © Speigel, Bichler and García.},

Clearly, predicting this disease in the early stages and preventing it from progressing is of great importance. The diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) requires a variety of medical tests, which leads to huge amounts of multivariate heterogeneous data. It can be difficult and exhausting to manually compare, visualize, and analyze this data due to the heterogeneous nature of medical tests, therefore, an efficient approach for accurate prediction of the condition of the brain through the classification of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images is greatly beneficial and yet very challenging. In this paper, a novel approach is proposed for the diagnosis of very early stages of AD through an efficient classification of brain MRI images, which uses label propagation in a manifold-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first apply voxel morphometry analysis to extract some of the most critical AD-related features of brain images from the original MRI volumes and also gray matter (GM) segmentation volumes. The features must capture the most discriminative properties that vary between a healthy and Alzheimer-affected brain. Next, we perform a principal component analysis (PCA)-based dimension reduction on the extracted features for faster yet sufficiently accurate analysis. To make the best use of the captured features, we present a hybrid manifold learning framework which embeds the feature vectors in a subspace. Next, using a small set of labeled training data, we apply a label propagation method in the created manifold space to predict the labels of the remaining images and classify them in the two groups of mild Alzheimer’s and normal condition (MCI/NC). The accuracy of the classification using the proposed method is 93.86% for the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) database of MRI brain images, providing, compared to the best existing methods, a 3% lower error rate. © 2017 by the authors.

abstract={The most definitive classification systems for dementia are based on the underlying pathology which, in turn, is categorized largely according to the observed accumulation of abnormal protein aggregates in neurons and glia. These aggregates perturb molecular processes, cellular functions and, ultimately, cell survival, with ensuing disruption of large-scale neural networks subserving cognitive, behavioural and sensorimotor functions. The functional domains affected and the evolution of deficits in these domains over time serve as footprints that the clinician can trace back with various levels of certainty to the underlying neuropathology. The process of phenotyping and syndromic classification has substantially improved over decades of careful clinicopathological correlation, and through the discovery of in vivo biomarkers of disease. Here, we present an overview of the salient features of the most common dementia subtypes-Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia, frontotemporal dementia and related syndromes, Lewy body dementias, and prion diseases-with an emphasis on neuropathology, relevant epidemiology, risk factors, and signature signs and symptoms. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.

abstract={2-Deoxy-2-[fluorine-18] fluoro-D-glucose (18F-FDG) Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging offers meaningful information for various types of diseases diagnosis. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), the hypometabolism of glucose which observed on the low intensity voxel in PET image may relate to the onset of the disease. The importance of early detection of AD is inevitable because the resultant brain damage is irreversible. Several statistical analysis and machine learning algorithm have been proposed to investigate the rate and the pattern of the hypometabolism. This study focus on the same aim with further investigation was performed on several hypometabolism pattern. Some pre-processing steps were implemented to standardize the data in order to minimize the effect of resolution and anatomical differences. The features used are the mean voxel intensity within the AD pattern mask, which derived from several z-score and FDR threshold values. The global mean voxel (GMV) and slice-based mean voxel (SbMV) intensity were observed and used as input to the neural network. Several neural network architectures were tested and compared to the nearest neighbour method. The highest accuracy equals to 0.9 and recorded at z-score ≤−1.3 with 1 node neural network architecture (sensitivity=0.81 and specificity=0.95) and at z-score ≤−0.7 with 10 nodes neural network (sensitivity=0.83 and specificity=0.94). © 2016},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the kind of dementia that affects the most people around the world. Therefore, an early identification supporting effective treatments is required to increase the life quality of a wide number of patients. Recently, computer-aided diagnosis tools for dementia using Magnetic Resonance Imaging scans have been successfully proposed to discriminate between patients with AD, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy controls. Most of the attention has been given to the clinical data, provided by initiatives as the ADNI, supporting reliable researches on intervention, prevention, and treatments of AD. Therefore, there is a need for improving the performance of classification machines. In this paper, we propose a kernel framework for learning metrics that enhances conventional machines and supports the diagnosis of dementia. Our framework aims at building discriminative spaces through the maximization of center kernel alignment function, aiming at improving the discrimination of the three considered neurological classes. The proposed metric learning performance is evaluated on the widely-known ADNI database using three supervised classification machines (k-nn, SVM and NNs) for multi-class and bi-class scenarios from structural MRIs. Specifically, from ADNI collection 286 AD patients, 379 MCI patients and 231 healthy controls are used for development and validation of our proposed metric learning framework. For the experimental validation, we split the data into two subsets: 30% of subjects used like a blindfolded assessment and 70% employed for parameter tuning. Then, in the preprocessing stage, each structural MRI scan a total of 310 morphological measurements are automatically extracted from by FreeSurfer software package and concatenated to build an input feature matrix. Obtained test performance results, show that including a supervised metric learning improves the compared baseline classifiers in both scenarios. In the multi-class scenario, we achieve the best performance (accuracy 60.1%) for pretrained 1-layered NN, and we obtain measures over 90% in the average for HC vs. AD task. From the machine learning point of view, our proposal enhances the classifier performance by building spaces with a better class separability. From the clinical application, our enhancement results in a more balanced performance in each class than the compared approaches from the CADDementia challenge by increasing the sensitivity of pathological groups and the specificity of healthy controls. © 2017 Cárdenas-Peña, Collazos-Huertas and Castellanos-Dominguez.},

abstract={With millions of people suffering from dementia worldwide, the global prevalence of dementia has a significant impact on the patients' lives, their caregivers' physical and emotional states, and the global economy. Early diagnosis of dementia helps in finding suitable therapies that reduce or even prevent further deterioration of patients' cognitive abilities. In recent years, state-of-the-art literature has proposed various computer-aided diagnosis systems based on 3-dimensional brain imagery analysis to identify early symptoms of dementia. These systems aim to assist radiologists in increasing the accuracy of diagnoses and reducing false positives. However, the early diagnosis of dementia is a challenging task due to the image quality, noise, and human brain irregularities. The state-of-the-art has focused on differentiating multi-stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, the diagnosis of various types of dementia is still a gap. This paper proposes a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis approach for the early detection of multi-type of dementia. To show the performance of the proposed CAD algorithm, three conventional CAD methods are implemented for comparison. The proposed algorithm yields a 74.93% accuracy in early diagnosis of multi-type of dementia and outperforms the state of the art CAD methods. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={This work proposes multiclass deep learning classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using novel texture and other associated features extracted from structural MRI. Two distinct learning models (Model 1 and 2) are presented where both include subcortical area specific feature extraction, feature selection and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) deep neural network (DNN). The models learn highly complex and subtle differences in spatial atrophy patterns using white matter volumes, gray matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and different types of Fractal Brownian Motion co-occurrence matrices for texture as features to classify AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in dementia patients. A five layer SAE with state-of-the-art dropout learning is trained on a publicly available ADNI dataset and the model performances are evaluated at two levels: one using in-house tenfold cross validation and another using the publicly available CADDementia competition. The in-house evaluations of our two models achieve 56.6% and 58.0% tenfold cross validation accuracies using 504 ADNI subjects. For the public domain evaluation, we are the first to report DNN to CADDementia and our methods yield competitive classification accuracies of 51.4% and 56.8%. Further, both of our proposed models offer higher True Positive Fraction (TPF) for AD class when compared to the top-overall ranked algorithm while Model 1 also ties for top diseased class sensitivity at 58.2% in the CADDementia challenge. Finally, Model 2 achieves strong disease class sensitivity with improvement in specificity and overall accuracy. Our algorithms have the potential to provide a rapid, objective, and non-invasive assessment of AD. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={The monitoring of volumetric changes in the brain during neurological diseases is done with three dimensional structural MR images. Numerical methods are needed to evaluate the volumetric difference between healthy and diseased MR image groups. Voxel based morphometry is a numerical method used to perform inter-group and intra-group analysis of MR images. With this method, the volume differences between the groups can be analyzed in the coordinate dimension. In this study, volumetric differences between Alzheimer and Normal MR images were investigated by voxel based morphometry. From these differences, three dimensional volume loss masks of groups were obtained. The mask of loss was masked with the gray matter area where the basic volume losses of Alzheimer's begin. In each gray matter image, the voxel values corresponding to the same coordinates as the loss mask were transformed into a vector. The voxel values corresponding to the same point as the loss point were ranked by t-test and the most significant coordinate values were ranked. After this ranking, classification was done with support vector machines using voxel values. As a result of this model, the number of voxel coordinates giving the best classification was determined and the performance of the method was measured. © 2017 IEEE.},

abstract={Background. Error-free diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from healthy control (HC) patients at an early stage of the disease is a major concern, because information about the condition's severity and developmental risks present allows AD sufferer to take precautionary measures before irreversible brain damage occurs. Recently, there has been great interest in computer-aided diagnosis in magnetic resonance image (MRI) classification. However, distinguishing between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 60) is challenging because of their highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. Recently, cutting-edge feature extraction technologies have found extensive application in numerous fields, including medical image analysis. Here, we propose a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT) for extracting features from an image. The dimensionality of feature vector is reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA). The reduced feature vector is sent to feed-forward neural network (FNN) to distinguish AD and HC from the input MR images. These proposed and implemented pipelines, which demonstrate improvements in classification output when compared to that of recent studies, resulted in high and reproducible accuracy rates of 90.06 ± 0.01% with a sensitivity of 92.00 ± 0.04%, a specificity of 87.78 ± 0.04%, and a precision of 89.6 ± 0.03% with 10-fold cross-validation. © 2017 Debesh Jha et al.},

abstract={Objective: To determine whether logopenic features of phonologic loop dysfunction reflect Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology in primary progressive aphasia (PPA). Methods: We performed a retrospective case-control study of 34 patients with PPA with available autopsy tissue. We compared baseline and longitudinal clinical features in patients with primary AD neuropathology to those with primary non-AD pathologies. We analyzed regional neuroanatomic disease burden in pathology-defined groups using postmortem neuropathologic data. Results: A total of 19/34 patients had primary AD pathology and 15/34 had non-AD pathology (13 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Lewy body disease). A total of 16/19 (84%) patients with AD had a logopenic spectrum phenotype; 5 met published criteria for the logopenic variant (lvPPA), 8 had additional grammatical or semantic deficits (lvPPA+), and 3 had relatively preserved sentence repetition (lvPPA-). Sentence repetition was impaired in 68% of patients with PPA with AD pathology; forward digit span (DF) was impaired in 90%, substantially higher than in non-AD PPA (33%, p < 0.01). Lexical retrieval difficulty was common in all patients with PPA and did not discriminate between groups. Compared to non-AD, PPA with AD pathology had elevated microscopic neurodegenerative pathology in the superior/midtemporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and midfrontal cortex (p < 0.01). Low DF scores correlated with high microscopic pathologic burden in superior/midtemporal and angular gyri (p ≤ 0.03). Conclusions: Phonologic loop dysfunction is a central feature of AD-associated PPA and specifically correlates with temporoparietal neurodegeneration. Quantitative measures of phonologic loop function, combined with modified clinical lvPPA criteria, may help discriminate AD-associated PPA. © 2017 American Academy of Neurology.},

abstract={Early diagnosis of Alzheimer disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is always useful. Preventive measures might have an impact on reducing AD risk factors. Structural magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, one of the vital sensitive biomarkers for cerebral atrophy in the brain, is used to extract volumetric feature by FreeSurfer and the CIVET toolbox. All of the structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI) data that we used were downloaded from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu) of imaging data. This novel approach is applied for the diagnosis of AD and MCI from healthy controls (HCs) combining extracted features with the MMSE (mini-mental state examination) scores, applying a two sample t-test to select a subset of features. The subset of features is fed to kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) module to project data onto the reduced principal component coefficients at higher dimensional kernel space to increase the linear separability. Then, the kernel PCA coefficients are projected into the more efficient linear discriminant space using linear discriminant analysis. A multi-kernel learning support vector machine (SVM) is used on newly projected data for stratification of AD and MCI from HCs. Using this approach, we obtain 93.85% classification accuracy when detecting AD from HCs for segmented volumetric features (using FreeSurfer) with high sensitivity and specificity. When distinguishing MCI from HCs and AD using volumetric features after subcortical segmentation, the detection rate reaches 86.54% and 75.12%, respectively. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Object-location memory is particularly fragile and specifically impaired in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients. Electroencephalogram (EEG) was utilized to objectively measure memory impairment for memory formation correlates of EEG oscillatory activities. We aimed to construct an object-location memory paradigm and explore EEG signs of it. Two groups of 20 probable mild AD patients and 19 healthy older adults were included in a cross-sectional analysis. All subjects took an object-location memory task. EEG recordings performed during object-location memory tasks were compared between the two groups in the two EEG parameters (spectral parameters and phase synchronization). The memory performance of AD patients was worse than that of healthy elderly adults The power of object-location memory of the AD group was significantly higher than the NC group (healthy elderly adults) in the alpha band in the encoding session, and alpha and theta bands in the retrieval session. The channels-pairs the phase lag index value of object-location memory in the AD group was clearly higher than the NC group in the delta, theta, and alpha bands in encoding sessions and delta and theta bands in retrieval sessions. The results provide support for the hypothesis that the AD patients may use compensation mechanisms to remember the items and episode. © 2017 Han, Wang, Jia and Wu.},

abstract={Generative models focused on multifactorial causal mechanisms in brain disorders are scarce and generally based on limited data. Despite the biological importance of the multiple interacting processes, their effects remain poorly characterized from an integrative analytic perspective. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal multifactorial causal model (MCM) of brain (dis)organization and therapeutic intervention that accounts for local causal interactions, effects propagation via physical brain networks, cognitive alterations, and identification of optimum therapeutic interventions. In this article, we focus on describing the model and applying it at the population-based level for studying late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). By interrelating six different neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measurements, this model accurately predicts spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-β (Aβ) burden, glucose metabolism, vascular flow, resting state functional activity, structural properties, and cognitive integrity. The results suggest that a vascular dysregulation may be the most-likely initial pathologic event leading to LOAD. Nevertheless, they also suggest that LOAD it is not caused by a unique dominant biological factor (e.g. vascular or Aβ) but by the complex interplay among multiple relevant direct interactions. Furthermore, using theoretical control analysis of the identified population-based multifactorial causal network, we show the crucial advantage of using combinatorial over single-target treatments, explain why one-target Aβ based therapies might fail to improve clinical outcomes, and propose an efficiency ranking of possible LOAD interventions. Although still requiring further validation at the individual level, this work presents the first analytic framework for dynamic multifactorial brain (dis)organization that may explain both the pathologic evolution of progressive neurological disorders and operationalize the influence of multiple interventional strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most promising noninvasive techniques for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In this paper, we explore the application of different machine learning techniques to the classification of fMRI data for this purpose. The functional images were first preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox to output individual maps of statistically activated voxels. A fast filter was applied afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and nondemented groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14% average accuracy. Results repeatedly pointed out Brodmann regions with distinct activation patterns between demented and nondemented profiles, indicating that the machine learning analysis described is a powerful method to detect differences in several brain regions between both groups. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={A common finding in human functional brain-imaging studies is that damage to neural systems paradoxically results in enhanced functional connectivity between network regions, a phenomenon commonly referred to as ‘hyperconnectivity’. Here, we describe the various ways that hyperconnectivity operates to benefit a neural network following injury while simultaneously negotiating the trade-off between metabolic cost and communication efficiency. Hyperconnectivity may be optimally expressed by increasing connections through the most central and metabolically efficient regions (i.e., hubs). While adaptive in the short term, we propose that chronic hyperconnectivity may leave network hubs vulnerable to secondary pathological processes over the life span due to chronically elevated metabolic stress. We conclude by offering novel, testable hypotheses for advancing our understanding of the role of hyperconnectivity in systems-level brain plasticity in neurological disorders. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The main objective of our research is to introduce an approach that uses noninvasive MRI images to predict the conversion from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. It detects normal controls that are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment patients that are likely to establish Alzheimer's disease within two years or, contrarily, their stage remains same. The proposed approach uses two types of features i.e. Volumetric features and textural features. Volumetric features consist of volume of grey matter, volume of white matter and volume of cerebrospinal fluid. A total of 364 textural features have been calculated. To avoid the curse of dimensionality, textural features are reduced to 15 features using gain ratio, a ranking based search algorithm. All features are tested against four classifiers i.e. AODEsr, VFI, RBF and LBR. Leave-One- Out cross validation strategy is used for the evaluation of proposed approach. Results show accuracy of 98.33% with volumetric features and 100% with textural features using VFI and LBR. Our approach is innovative because of its higher accuracy results as compared to existing approaches yet with a smaller feature set.},

abstract={We developed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that uses feature-ranking and a genetic algorithm to analyze structural magnetic resonance imaging data; using this system, we can predict conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD) at between one and three years before clinical diagnosis. The CAD system was developed in four stages. First, we used a voxel-based morphometry technique to investigate global and local gray matter (GM) atrophy in an AD group compared with healthy controls (HCs). Regions with significant GM volume reduction were segmented as volumes of interest (VOIs). Second, these VOIs were used to extract voxel values from the respective atrophy regions in AD, HC, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) patient groups. The voxel values were then extracted into a feature vector. Third, at the feature-selection stage, all features were ranked according to their respective t-test scores and a genetic algorithm designed to find the optimal feature subset. The Fisher criterion was used as part of the objective function in the genetic algorithm. Finally, the classification was carried out using a support vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation. We evaluated the proposed automatic CAD system by applying it to baseline values from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (160 AD, 162 HC, 65 sMCI and 71 pMCI subjects). The experimental results indicated that the proposed system is capable of distinguishing between sMCI and pMCI patients, and would be appropriate for practical use in a clinical setting. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Introduction The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015. Methods We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data. Results (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition (Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by “classic” AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal classifiers. Discussion Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and improves clinical trial design. © 2017},

abstract={Background. Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEG without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the disease. Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones. Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7–14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age range 7–12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant features vector input of EEG on which supervised machine learning systems acted as blind classifiers. Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature. Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={In the last decade, pattern recognition methods using neuroimaging data for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been the subject of extensive research. Deep learning has recently been a great interest in AD classification. Previous works had done almost on single modality dataset, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), shown high performances. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. The corporation of multimodalities can solve this issue since it discovers and uses the further complementary of hidden biomarkers from other modalities instead of only one, which itself cannot provide. We therefore propose a deep learning method on fusion multimodalities. In details, our approach includes Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) train and test on combined PET-MRI data to diagnose the disease status of a patient. We focus on advantages of multimodalities to help providing complementary information than only one, lead to improve classification accuracy. We conducted experiments in a dataset of 1272 scans from ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 90% between AD patients and healthy controls, demonstrate the improvement than using only one modality. © 2017 IEEE.},

Method Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and WMH were assessed in 78 subjects with increased amyloid levels on AV-45 positron emission tomography (PET) in different clinical stages of AD. We tested the association between WMH volume in major atlas-based fiber tract regions of interest (ROIs) and changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the tracts' projection areas within the default mode network (DMN). Results WMH volume within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was the highest among all tract ROIs and associated with reduced FC in IFOF-connected DMN areas, independently of global AV-45 PET. Higher AV-45 PET contributed to reduced FC in IFOF-connected, temporal, and parietal DMN areas. Conclusions High fiber tract WMH burden is associated with reduced FC in connected areas, thus adding to the effects of amyloid pathology on neuronal network function. © 2016 The Authors},

abstract={Deep learning (DL) is a family of machine learning methods that has gained considerable attention in the scientific community, breaking benchmark records in areas such as speech and visual recognition. DL differs from conventional machine learning methods by virtue of its ability to learn the optimal representation from the raw data through consecutive nonlinear transformations, achieving increasingly higher levels of abstraction and complexity. Given its ability to detect abstract and complex patterns, DL has been applied in neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are characterised by subtle and diffuse alterations. Here we introduce the underlying concepts of DL and review studies that have used this approach to classify brain-based disorders. The results of these studies indicate that DL could be a powerful tool in the current search for biomarkers of psychiatric and neurologic disease. We conclude our review by discussing the main promises and challenges of using DL to elucidate brain-based disorders, as well as possible directions for future research. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Impairments of word recognition in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) have been less widely investigated than impairments affecting word retrieval and production. In particular, we know little about what makes individual words easier or harder for patients with AD to recognize. We used a lexical selection task in which participants were shown sets of four items, each set consisting of one word and three non-words. The task was simply to point to the word on each trial. Forty patients with mild-to-moderate AD were significantly impaired on this task relative to matched controls who made very few errors. The number of patients with AD able to recognize each word correctly was predicted by the frequency, age of acquisition, and imageability of the words, but not by their length or number of orthographic neighbours. Patient Mini-Mental State Examination and phonological fluency scores also predicted the number of words recognized. We propose that progressive degradation of central semantic representations in AD differentially affects the ability to recognize low-imageability, low-frequency, late-acquired words, with the same factors affecting word recognition as affecting word retrieval. © 2015 The British Psychological Society},

abstract={Purpose: To investigate associations between neuroimaging markers of cerebrovascular disease, including lesion topography and extent and severity of strategic and global cerebral tissue injury, and cognition in carotid artery disease (CAD). Materials and Methods: All participants gave written informed consent to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised. One hundred eight patients with symptomatic CAD but no dementia were included, and a score less than 82 represented cognitive impairment. Group comparison and interrelations between global cognitive and?uency performance, lesion topography, and ultrastructural damage were assessed with voxelbased statistics. Associations between cognition, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA), lesion volumes, and global white matter ultrastructural damage indexed as increased mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers selected from a multivariate prediction model was tested with receiver operating characteristic analysis. Results: Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 [49.1%], classifed as having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older than nonimpaired patients (P =.027) and had more frequent MTA (P <.001), more cortical infarctions (P =.016), and larger volumes of acute (P =.028) and chronic (P =.009) subcortical ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not correlate with global cognitive performance (lacunar infarctions, P =.060; acute lesions, P =.088; chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, P =.085). In contrast, cognitive performance correlated with presence of chronic ischemic lesions within the interhemispheric tracts and thalamic radiation (P,.05, false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton mean diffusivity showed the closest correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.311, P,.001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cognitive disorder (area under the curve, 0.82 [95% confdence interval: 0.75, 0.90]). Findings were confrmed in subjects with a low risk of preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by the absence of MTA (n = 85). Conclusion: Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion locations and severity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that subcortical disconnection within large-scale cognitive neural networks is a key mechanism of vascular cognitive disorder. © 2016 RSNA.},

abstract={A novel technique of quantitative EEG for differentiating patients with early-stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from other forms of rapidly progressive dementia (RPD) is proposed. The discrimination is based on the extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency representation of the EEG signals through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy (PE) is also included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer neural networks (MLP-NN). A subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC) is considered for differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able to achieve an average accuracy of 89%, an average sensitivity of 92%, and an average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC. © 2017 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={Medical Images data is widely acknowledged for its large volumes, high complexities and limited labels information, which makes learning-based tasks challenging to obtain promising performance based on such images data. Also, Alzheimer’s disease, one of the five most severe non-communicable diseases all around the world, receives much attention in both academic research and clinical diagnosis for the time being. It is generally acknowledged that magnetic resonance imaging, a popular imaging tool because of its free of radiation exposure in terms of patients safety issues, has been vastly employed in Alzheimer’s disease diagnosis in recent years. However, most contemporary clinical diagnosis efforts still heavily rely on clinicians’ expertise to realize the disease diagnosis task. In this study, inspired by the recent rapid development of deep learning and low-resource learning techniques, a novel image-based disease diagnosis scheme is proposed to automatically fulfil the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease based on arterial spin labeling magnetic resonance images. This new end-to-end low-resource learning scheme is conducted following four steps. First, raw arterial spin labeling images need to be acquired and essential pre-processing steps should be carried out on raw images. Second, the popular convolutional neural network technique is adopted to automatically extract latent trainable features from processed arterial spin labelling images, instead of traditional hand-crafted features. Third, a novel low-resource pair-wise learning method inspired by the semi-supervised learning theory is carried out based on latent trainable features for automatically determining disease similarity functions. Forth, learned outcomes are then fed into a multi-nominal logistic regression model and a regression process with the highest posterior probability is capable to reveal the corresponding disease diagnosis outcome. Extensive experiments based on a database composed of magnetic resonance images acquired from 350 real demented patients are carried out with the newly poroposed scheme being compared towards several other well-known diagnosis tools. All diagnosis results have undergone rigorous and comprehensive statistical analysis composed of analysis of variance and multiple comparison tests. The superiority of the new scheme has been demonstrated therein. © 2017 Springer Science+Business Media New York},

abstract={Cognitive reserve (CR) prevents cognitive decline and delays neurodegeneration. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of dementia by ∼4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bilingualism and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied brain metabolism, a direct index of synaptic function and density, and neural connectivity to shed light on the effects of bilingualism in vivo in Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with probable AD and matched for disease duration (45 German-Italian bilingual speakers and 40 monolingual speakers) were included. Notably, bilingual individuals were on average 5 y older than their monolingual peers. In agreement with our predictions and with models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more severe in the group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic connectivity analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of bilingualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared with the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of lifelong bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was significantly correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural networks, suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory mechanisms. These findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts as a powerful CR proxy in dementia and exerts neuroprotective effects against neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of modern societies, and the present in vivo neurobiological evidence should stimulate social programs and interventions to support bilingual or multilingual education and the maintenance of the second language among senior citizens. ï¿½ 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

abstract={Aim: Alzheimer’s disease patients are increasing rapidly every year. Scholars tend to use computer vision methods to develop automatic diagnosis system. (Background) In 2015, Gorji et al. proposed a novel method using pseudo Zernike moment. They tested four classifiers: learning vector quantization neural network, pattern recognition neural network trained by Levenberg-Marquardt, by resilient backpropagation, and by scaled conjugate gradient. Method: This study presents an improved method by introducing a relatively new classifier-linear regression classification. Our method selects one axial slice from 3D brain image, and employed pseudo Zernike moment with maximum order of 15 to extract 256 features from each image. Finally, linear regression classification was harnessed as the classifier. Results: The proposed approach obtains an accuracy of 97.51%, a sensitivity of 96.71%, and a specificity of 97.73%. Conclusion: Our method performs better than Gorji’s approach and five other state-of-the-art approach- es. Therefore, it can be used to detect Alzheimer’s disease. ï¿½ 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Despite a great deal of research into Alzheimer's disease (AD) over the last 20 years, an effective treatment to halt or slow its progression has yet to be developed. With many aspects of the disease progression still to be elucidated, focus has shifted from reducing levels of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brains of AD patients towards tau, another pathology, which initiates much earlier in deeper brainstem networks and is thought to propagate via cell-to-cell processes prior to the onset of amyloid pathology and cognitive impairments. In-vitro, ex-vivo molecular biology/biochemistry read-outs, and various transgenic animal models have been developed, yet clinical failures have highlighted a clear disconnect and inadequate use of such animal models in translational research across species. AD pathology is now estimated to begin at least 10–20 years before clinical symptoms, and imaging and cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers are leading the way in assessing the disease progression at a stage where neuronal damage has already occurred. Here, we emphasize the relevance of assessing early disruptions in network connectivity and plasticity that occur before neuropathological damage and progressive memory dysfunction, which can have high translational value for discovery of pre-symptomatic AD biomarkers and early mechanism-based disease interception therapeutics. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

We also focused our attention on techniques applied in order to preprocess data and reduce their dimensionality via feature selection or projection in a more representative domain (Principal Component Analysis – PCA – or Partial Least Squares – PLS – are examples of such methods); this is a crucial step while dealing with medical data, since it is necessary to compress patient information and retain only the most useful in order to discriminate subjects into normal and pathological classes. Main literature papers on the application of these techniques to classify patients with neurodegenerative disease extracting data from molecular imaging modalities are reported, showing that the increasing development of computer aided diagnosis systems is very promising to contribute to the diagnostic process. ï¿½ 2017 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders has gained increasing attention in recent years. Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However, the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the ones discussed in this paper. Emerging big data technologies and advanced data-intensive machine learning methodologies such as deep learning have coincided with an increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single subject prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time. In this report, we survey the past and offer some opinions regarding the road ahead. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

Research efforts in the area of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease have used various aspects of computer-aided multi-class diagnosis approaches with varied degrees of success. However, there is still need for more efficient and reliable approaches to successful diagnosis of the disease. This research used deep learning framework with modified k-sparse autoencoder (oKSA) classification to locate neutrally degenerated areas of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low amyloid beta 1-42 imaging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid; each with a sample of 150 images. Results show a correlation between computational demarcation of infected regions and the images. Degeneration in the studied areas was evidenced by high phosphorylated t-/p-tau levels in CSF, regional fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and the presence of atrophy patterns. The use of oKSA algorithm in boosting classification helped to improve the classifier performance. The KSA method with deep learning framework is used for the first time to produce accurate results in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Brain network modelling has been shown effective to study the brain connectivity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Although the topological features of AD affected brain networks have been widely investigated, combining hierarchical networks features for predicting AD receives little attention. In this study, we propose a spectral convolutional neural network (SCNN) framework to learn combinations of hierarchical network features for a reliable AD prediction outcomes. Due to the complex high-dimensional structure of brain networks, conventional convolutional neural networks (CNN) are not able to learn the complete geometrical information of brain networks. To address this limitation, our SCNN is spectrally designed to learn a complete set of network topological features. Specifically, we construct structural brain networks using magnetic resonance images (MRI) from 288 ADs, 272 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 272 normal controls (NC). Then, we deploy SCNN to classify ADs from MCIs and NCs. Experiment results show that SCNN is able to achieve the accuracy of 91.07% in AD/NC classification, 87.72 in AD/MCI classification and 85.45% in MCI/HC classification. In addition, we show that SCNN is able to predict clinical scores associated with AD with high precision. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

SPARE-AD provides individualized scores of diagnostic and predictive value found to be far beyond standard structural measures. The index was incorporated in the image signature as a representation of the brain atrophy. To evaluate its influence to the retrieval results, Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) provided by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used. For this research, baseline images of the patients with diagnosed AD and normal controls (NL) were selected from the dataset, including 416 subjects in total. The obtained experimental results showed that the approach used in this research provides improved retrieval performance, by using semantically precise and powerful, yet low dimensional image descriptor. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

In this paper we focus on the hippocampus morphology which is known to be affected in relation with the progress of the illness. We use a subset of the ADNI (Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) database to clas- sify images belonging to Alzheimer’s disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and normal control (NC) subjects. As the number of images in such studies is rather limited regarding the needs of CNN, we pro- pose a data augmentation strategy adapted to the specificity of sMRI scans. We also propose a 2-D+ϵ approach, where only a very limited amount of consecutive slices are used for training and classification. The tests conducted on only one - saggital - projection show that this app- roach provides good classification accuracies: AD/NC 82.8% MCI/NC 66% AD/MCI 62.5% that are promising for integration of this 2-D+ϵ strategy in more complex multi-projection and multi-modal schemes. ï¿½ Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. Its early diagnosis is crucial for development of future treatment. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) play important role to help understand the brain anatomical changes related to AD. Conventional methods extract the hand-crafted features such as gray matter volumes and cortical thickness and train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. Different from these methods, this paper proposes to construct multiple deep 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) to learn the various features from local brain images which are combined to make the final classification for AD diagnosis. First, a number of local image patches are extracted from the whole brain image and a 3D-CNN is built upon each local patch to transform the local image into more compact high-level features. Then, the upper convolution and fully connected layers are fine-tuned to combine the multiple 3D-CNNs for image classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from imaging data for classification. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted structural MR brain images on 428 subjects including 199 AD patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 87.15% and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.26% for AD classification, demonstrating the promising classification performances. © 2017 SPIE.},

abstract={Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in pre-clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with risk factors for AD exhibit altered brain function several decades prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related fMRI study of spatial context memory we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged adults (MA; 40–58yrs) with a family history of late onset AD (MA+FH), or a combined +FH and apolipoprotein E ε4 allele risk factors for AD (MA+FH+APOE4), will exhibit differences in encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to −FH −APOE4 MA controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will exhibit distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and memory performance, compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we conducted multivariate task, and behavior, partial least squares analysis of fMRI data obtained during successful context encoding and retrieval. Our results indicate that even though there were no significant group differences in context memory performance, there were significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior correlations involving the hippocampus, inferior parietal cortex, cingulate, and precuneus cortex in MA with AD risk factors, compared to controls. In addition, we observed that brain activity and brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in ventral visual cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and from MAcontrols. Our results indicate that functional differences in episodic memory-related regions are present by early midlife in adults with +FH and +APOE-4 risk factors for late onset AD, compared to middle-aged controls. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia, which causes serious health and socioeconomic problems. A progressive neurodegenerative disorder, Alzheimer's causes the structural change in the brain, thereby affecting behavior, cognition, emotions, and memory. Numerous multivariate analysis algorithms have been used for classifying AD, distinguishing it from healthy controls (HC). Efficient early classification of AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from HC is imperative as early preventive care could help to mitigate risk factors. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), a noninvasive biomarker, displays morphometric differences and cerebral structural changes. A novel approach for distinguishing AD from HC using dual-tree complex wavelet transforms (DTCWT), principal coefficients from the transaxial slices of MRI images, linear discriminant analysis, and twin support vector machine is proposed here. The prediction accuracy of the proposed method yielded up to 92.65 ± 1.18 over the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset, with a specificity of 92.19 ± 1.56 and sensitivity of 93.11 ± 1.29, and 96.68 ± 1.44 over the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset, with a sensitivity of 97.72 ± 2.34 and specificity of 95.61 ± 1.67. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity achieved using the proposed method are comparable or superior to those obtained by various conventional AD prediction methods. © 2017 Saruar Alam et al.},

abstract={Classifying neurodegenerative brain diseases in MRI aims at correctly assigning discrete labels to MRI scans. Such labels usually refer to a diagnostic decision a learner infers based on what it has learned from a training sample of MRI scans. Classification from MRI voxels separately typically does not provide independent evidence towards or against a class; the information relevant for classification is only present in the form of complicated multivariate patterns (or “features”). Deep learning solves this problem by learning a sequence of non-linear transformations that result in feature representations that are better suited to classification. Such learned features have been shown to drastically outperform hand-engineered features in computer vision and audio analysis domains. However, applying the deep learning approach to the task of MRI classification is extremely challenging, because it requires a very large amount of data which is currently not available. We propose to instead use a three dimensional scattering transform, which resembles a deep convolutional neural network but has no learnable parameters. Furthermore, the scattering transform linearizes diffeomorphisms (due to e.g. residual anatomical variability in MRI scans), making the different disease states more easily separable using a linear classifier. In experiments on brain morphometry in Alzheimer's disease, and on white matter microstructural damage in HIV, scattering representations are shown to be highly effective for the task of disease classification. For instance, in semi-supervised learning of progressive versus stable MCI, we reach an accuracy of 82.7%. We also present a visualization method to highlight areas that provide evidence for or against a certain class, both on an individual and group level. © 2017 The Authors},

abstract={Intentional facial expression of emotion is critical to healthy social interactions. Patients with neurodegenerative disease, particularly those with right temporal or prefrontal atrophy, show dramatic socioemotional impairment. This was an exploratory study examining the neural and behavioral correlates of intentional facial expression of emotion in neurodegenerative disease patients and healthy controls. One hundred and thirty three participants (45 Alzheimer's disease, 16 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, 8 non-fluent primary progressive aphasia, 10 progressive supranuclear palsy, 11 right-temporal frontotemporal dementia, 9 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia patients and 34 healthy controls) were video recorded while imitating static images of emotional faces and producing emotional expressions based on verbal command; the accuracy of their expression was rated by blinded raters. Participants also underwent face-to-face socioemotional testing and informants described participants' typical socioemotional behavior. Patients' performance on emotion expression tasks was correlated with gray matter volume using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) across the entire sample. We found that intentional emotional imitation scores were related to fundamental socioemotional deficits; patients with known socioemotional deficits performed worse than controls on intentional emotion imitation; and intentional emotional expression predicted caregiver ratings of empathy and interpersonal warmth. Whole brain VBMs revealed a rightward cortical atrophy pattern homologous to the left lateralized speech production network was associated with intentional emotional imitation deficits. Results point to a possible neural mechanisms underlying complex socioemotional communication deficits in neurodegenerative disease patients. © 2017 The Authors},

Then, the best performing CNN is chosen and we create brain models for each filter at the CNN first layer as they convolve throughout MRI images of patient cases. The brain models are further explored as their corresponding filter activations throughout brain regions reveals different anatomical patterns for different patient class, and thus, allowing us to identify the CNN filters with greatest discriminating power and which brain regions contribute most. Specifically, the CNN shows the largest differentiation between patients in the frontal pole region, which is known to host intellectual deficits related to the disease.

abstract={The majority of logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) cases harbour Alzheimer pathology, suggesting that lv-PPA constitutes an atypical presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even if caused by Alzheimer pathology, the clinical manifestations of lv-PPA differ from those observed in the typical or amnestic AD presentation: in lv-PPA, aphasia is the main feature while amnestic AD is characterised by impaired episodic memory. Anomia or impaired naming, however, is present in both AD presentations. Whether these presentations share anatomical and mechanistic processes of anomia has not been fully investigated. Accordingly, we studied naming performance and its relationship with regions of brain atrophy in 23 amnestic AD and 22 lv-PPA cases with presumed underlying Alzheimer pathology. Both AD groups displayed some degree of anomia and impaired word comprehension but these were particularly severe in lv-PPA and accompanied by a range of linguistic deficits, comprising phonological substitutions, superordinate semantic paraphasias and abnormal single-word repetition. Analysis of cortical thickness revealed that anomia was correlated with thinning in left superior temporal gyrus in both groups. In amnestic AD, however, anomia was also associated with thinning in right inferior temporal regions. Single-word comprehension (SWC), by contrast, was associated with cortical thinning involving bilateral fusiform gyri in both groups. These findings suggest that anomia in both amnestic AD and lv-PPA results from the involvement at multiple steps of word processing, in particular, semantic and lexical retrieval; in addition lv-PPA patients display a more marked involvement of phonological processing. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={Objective: Nowadays, it is of great interest to identify neuroimaging biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is considered that approximately half of patients with a diagnosis of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) eventually develop Alzheimer's disease, and the other half remain stable. In this context, a novel convolutional neural network (CNN) based on voxel-based morphometric analysis is proposed to predict the prognosis of patients with MCI using their baseline structural magnetic resonance (MR) images. Methods: Two groups of patients were identified among 305 patients with a diagnosis of MCI, those who developed Alzheimer’s disease during their follow-up (n=140), and those who remained stable in the MCI state (n=165). The baseline structural MR images of the patients were used for training and evaluating the proposed prediction model. Voxel-based morphometry generated from the baseline structural MR images was used to obtain significant volume of interests (VOIs) related with gray matter damage. Then, a convolutional neural network was trained to extract prognostic features from MR images using a set of convolutional feature detectors acquired by the training of a patch-based autoencoder. Results: This work achieved an accuracy of 78.7%, slightly superior (more than 4%) to a reference study, for predicting the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease for patients with MCI. Conclusion: The results of this study show that the use of a convolutional neural network using significant topographic regions of the brain is successful in predicting the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease for patients with MCI. © 2017, Ege University Press.

abstract={Automatic knowledge extraction from medical images constitutes a key point in the construction of computer aided diagnosis tools (CAD). This takes a special relevance in the case of neurodegenerative diseases such as the Alzheimer’s disease (AD), where an early diagnosis makes the treatments easier and more effective. Moreover, the study of the evolution of the illness results crucial to differentiate the neurodegenerative process associated to the disease from the natural degeneration due to the ageing process. In this paper we present a method to construct longitudinal models from subjects using a series of MRI images. Specifically, the method presented here aims to model Gray matter (GM) variation at different brain areas of a subject across subsequent examinations, being possible to relate those regions which degenerate jointly. Hence, it allows determining variation patterns that differentiate controls from AD patients. Additionally, White matter (WM) density is also incorporated to the longitudinal model to complement the information provided by GM. The results obtained demonstrated the effectiveness of the method in the extraction of these patterns, that can be used to classify between Controls (CN) and AD subjects with 94% of accuracy, outperforming other previous methods. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measures the decline in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, offering a reliable metabolic biomarker even on presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. PET scans provide functional information that is unique and unavailable using other types of imaging. However, the computational efficacy of FDG-PET data alone, for the classification of various Alzheimers Diagnostic categories, has not been well studied. This motivates us to correctly discriminate various AD Diagnostic categories using FDG-PET data. Deep learning has improved state-of-the-art classification accuracies in the areas of speech, signal, image, video, text mining and recognition. We propose novel methods that involve probabilistic principal component analysis on max-pooled data and mean-pooled data for dimensionality reduction, and multilayer feed forward neural network which performs binary classification. Our experimental dataset consists of baseline data of subjects including 186 cognitively unimpaired (CU) subjects, 336 mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects with 158 Late MCI and 178 Early MCI, and 146 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. We measured F1-measure, precision, recall, negative and positive predictive values with a 10-fold cross validation scheme. Our results indicate that our designed classifiers achieve competitive results while max pooling achieves better classification performance compared to mean-pooled features. Our deep model based research may advance FDG-PET analysis by demonstrating their potential as an effective imaging biomarker of AD. © 2017 SPIE.},

abstract={Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) plays important role for the patient care and development of future treatment. Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality which can help physicians to predict AD. In recent years, machine learning methods have been widely studied on analysis of PET brain images for quantitative evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft imaging features from images, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. This paper proposes to construct cascaded 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) to hierarchically learn the multi-level imaging features which are ensembled for classification of AD using PET brain images. First, multiple deep 3D-CNNs are constructed on different local image patches to transform the local image into more compact high-level features. Then, a deep 3D CNNs is learned to ensemble the high-level features for final classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from PET imaging data for classification. No image segmentation and rigid registration are required in preprocessing the PET images. Our method is evaluated on the PET images from 193 subjects including 93 AD patients and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.2% for classification of AD vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract={Previous evidence showed a 75.5% best accuracy in the classification of 120 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with dementia and 100 matched normal elderly (Nold) subjects based on cortical source current density and linear lagged connectivity estimated by eLORETA freeware from resting state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms (Babiloni et al., 2016a). Specifically, that accuracy was reached using the ratio between occipital delta and alpha1 current density for a linear univariate classifier (receiver operating characteristic curves). Here we tested an innovative approach based on an artificial neural network (ANN) classifier from the same database of rsEEG markers. Frequency bands of interest were delta (2-4 Hz), theta (4-8 Hz Hz), alpha1 (8-10.5 Hz), and alpha2 (10.5-13 Hz). ANN classification showed an accuracy of 77% using the most 4 discriminative rsEEG markers of source current density (parietal theta/alpha 1, temporal theta/alpha 1, occipital theta/alpha 1, and occipital delta/alpha 1). It also showed an accuracy of 72% using the most 4 discriminative rsEEG markers of source lagged linear connectivity (inter-hemispherical occipital delta/alpha 2, intra-hemispherical right parietal-limbic alpha 1, intra-hemispherical left occipital-temporal theta/alpha 1, intra-hemispherical right occipital-temporal theta/alpha 1). With these 8 markers combined, an accuracy of at least 76% was reached. Interestingly, this accuracy based on 8 (linear) rsEEG markers as inputs to ANN was similar to that obtained with a single rsEEG marker (Babiloni et al., 2016a), thus unveiling their information redundancy for classification purposes. In future AD studies, inputs to ANNs should include other classes of independent linear (i.e., directed transfer function) and non-linear (i.e., entropy) rsEEG markers to improve the classification. ï¿½ 2017 Triggiani, Bevilacqua, Brunetti, Lizio, Tattoli, Cassano, Soricelli, Ferri, Nobili, Gesualdo, Barulli, Tortelli, Cardinali, Giannini, Spagnolo, Armenise, Stocchi, Buenza, Scianatico, Logroscino, Lacidogna, Orzi, Buttinelli, Giubilei, Del Percio, Frisoni and Babiloni.},

abstract={In this paper, we aim to maximally utilize multimodality neuroimaging and genetic data to predict Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal status, i.e., a multi-status dementia diagnosis problem. Multimodality neuroimaging data such as MRI and PET provide valuable insights to abnormalities, and genetic data such as Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) provide information about a patient’s AD risk factors. When used in conjunction, AD diagnosis may be improved. However, these data are heterogeneous (e.g., having different data distributions), and have different number of samples (e.g., PET data is having far less number of samples than the numbers of MRI or SNPs). Thus, learning an effective model using these data is challenging. To this end, we present a novel three-stage deep feature learning and fusion framework, where the deep neural network is trained stage-wise. Each stage of the network learns feature representations for different combination of modalities, via effective training using maximum number of available samples. Specifically, in the first stage, we learn latent representations (i.e., high-level features) for each modality independently, so that the heterogeneity between modalities can be better addressed and then combined in the next stage. In the second stage, we learn the joint latent features for each pair of modality combination by using the high-level features learned from the first stage. In the third stage, we learn the diagnostic labels by fusing the learned joint latent features from the second stage. We have tested our framework on Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset for multi-status AD diagnosis, and the experimental results show that the proposed framework outperforms other methods. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

The proposed technique uses Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) to extract the wavelet energy features from PET brain images. The extracted energy features are sent to BPNN for training. Parameters of BPNN are optimized through PSO algorithm. This method was applied on 130 PET brain images (70 normal,60 AD) and achieved the classification accuracy of 96.32%. Simulation results suggest that the BPNN offer high potential in the diagnosis of AD at an early stage.},

abstract={Cocaine dependence continues to devastate millions of human lives. According to the 2013 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 1.5 million Americans are currently addicted to cocaine. It is important to understand how cocaine addicts and non-addicted individuals differ in the functional organization of the brain. This work advances the identification of cocaine dependence based on fMRI classification and innovates by employing deep learning methods. Deep learning has proved its utility in machine learning community, mainly in computational vision and voice recognition. Recently, studies have successfully applied it to fMRI data for brain decoding and classification of pathologies, such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s disease. These fMRI data were relatively large, and the use of deep learning in small data sets still remains a challenge. In this study, we fill this gap by (i) using Deep Belief Networks and Deep Neural Network to classify cocaine dependents from fMRI, and (ii) presenting a novel stratification method for robust training and evaluation of a relatively small data set. Our results show that deep learning outperforms traditional techniques in most cases, and present a great potential for improvement. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Mathematical representations of brain networks in neuroscience through the use of graph theory may be very useful for the understanding of neurological diseases and disorders and such an explanatory power is currently under intense investigation. Graph metrics are expected to vary across subjects and are likely to reflect behavioural and cognitive performances. The challenge is to set up a framework that can explain how behaviour, cognition, memory, and other brain properties can emerge through the combined interactions of neurons, ensembles of neurons, and larger-scale brain regions that make information transfer possible. “Hidden” graph theoretic properties in the construction of brain networks may limit or enhance brain functionality and may be representative of aspects of human psychology. As theorems emerge from simple mathematical properties of graphs, similarly, cognition and behaviour may emerge from the molecular, cellular and brain region substrate interactions. In this review report, we identify some studies in the current literature that have used graph theoretical metrics to extract neurobiological conclusions, we briefly discuss the link with the human connectome project as an effort to integrate human data that may aid the study of emergent patterns and we suggest a way to start categorizing diseases according to their brain network pathologies as these are measured by graph theory. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.},

abstract={Initial stages of Alzheimer's disease are easily confused with the normal aging process. Additionally, the methodology involved in the diagnosis by radiologists can be subjective and difficult to document. In this scenario, the development of accessible approaches capable of supporting the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. Various approaches have been employed with this objective, specially using brain MRI scans. Although certain satisfactory accuracy results have been achieved, most of the approaches requires very specific pre-processing steps based on the brain anatomy. In this paper, we present a novel image retrieval approach for supporting the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic, based on general use features and unsupervised post-processing step. The brain MRI scans are processed and retrieved through general features without any pre-processing step. In the following, a rankbased unsupervised distance learning procedure is performed for improving the effectiveness of the initial results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve effective retrieval results, being suitable in aiding the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background and objective This paper presents an automatic computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on feature ranking for detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data. Methods The proposed CAD system is composed of four systematic stages. First, global and local differences in the gray matter (GM) of AD patients compared to the GM of healthy controls (HCs) are analyzed using a voxel-based morphometry technique. The aim is to identify significant local differences in the volume of GM as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel intensity values of the VOIs are extracted as raw features. Third, the raw features are ranked using a seven-feature ranking method, namely, statistical dependency (SD), mutual information (MI), information gain (IG), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC), t-test score (TS), Fisher's criterion (FC), and the Gini index (GI). The features with higher scores are more discriminative. To determine the number of top features, the estimated classification error based on training set made up of the AD and HC groups is calculated, with the vector size that minimized this error selected as the top discriminative feature. Fourth, the classification is performed using a support vector machine (SVM). In addition, a data fusion approach among feature ranking methods is introduced to improve the classification performance. Results The proposed method is evaluated using a data-set from ADNI (130 AD and 130 HC) with 10-fold cross-validation. The classification accuracy of the proposed automatic system for the diagnosis of AD is up to 92.48% using the sMRI data. Conclusions An automatic CAD system for the classification of AD based on feature-ranking method and classification errors is proposed. In this regard, seven-feature ranking methods (i.e., SD, MI, IG, PCC, TS, FC, and GI) are evaluated. The optimal size of top discriminative features is determined by the classification error estimation in the training phase. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed system is comparative to that of state-of-the-art classification models. © 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd},

abstract={Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show impairment of episodic memory and related metacognitive processes. The present study examined subjective metacognitive judgments preceding objective memory retrieval and investigated the neural correlates of pessimistic predictions for successfully retrieved memories in AD patients. AD patients and healthy older (HO) participants provided predictive judgments on their recognition performance before retrieval of famous (semantic) and recently learned (episodic) names. Correlations between gray matter volume (GMV) in T1 images and behavioral scores were examined with multivariate (partial least square – PLS) and univariate (general linear model – GLM) analyses in AD patients. AD patients showed a significant proportion of successful name recognition preceded by pessimistic prediction in episodic memory. PLS revealed that the behavioral pattern in AD patients was related with a mainly right lateralized pattern of GMV decrease including medial temporal lobe and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), but also right ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC). GLM further confirmed that pessimistic prediction negatively correlated with GMV in VLPFC. Thus, impaired monitoring processes (possibly influenced by inaccurate beliefs) allowing inferences about one's own memory performance are primarily related to decrease GMV in VLPFC in AD patients. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={The emergence of life-logging technologies has led neuropsychologist to focus on understanding how this new technology could help patients with memory disorders. Despite the growing number of studies using life-logging technologies, a theoretical framework supporting its effectiveness is lacking. This review focuses on the use of life-logging in the context of memory rehabilitation, particularly the use of SenseCam, a wearable camera allowing passive image capture. In our opinion, reviewing SenseCam images can be effective for memory rehabilitation only if it provides more than an assessment of prior occurrence in ways that reinstates previous thoughts, feelings and sensory information, thus stimulating recollection. Considering the fact that, in memory impairment, self-initiated processes are impaired, we propose that the environmental support hypothesis can explain the value of SenseCam for memory retrieval. Twenty-five research studies were selected for this review and despite the general acceptance of the value of SenseCam as a memory technique, only a small number of studies focused on recollection. We discuss the usability of this tool to improve episodic memory and in particular, recollection. © 2016 Elsevier Masson SAS},

abstract={One of the current challenges in Alzheimer's Disease (AD)-related research is to achieve an early and definite diagnosis. Automatic classification of AD is typically based on the use of feature vectors of high dimensionality, containing few training patterns, which leads to the curse-of-dimensionality problem. It is indispensable to find good approaches for selecting a subset of the original set of features. In this work, a method to perform early diagnosis of AD is proposed, combining different feature reduction approaches on both brain MRI studies and expression values of blood plasma proteins. Each selected set of features is used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM), then the set of SVM is combined by weighted sum rule. Moreover, a novel approach for considering the feature vector as an image is proposed, different texture descriptors are extracted from the image and used to train a SVM. The superior performance of the proposed system is obtained without any ad hoc parameter optimization (i.e., the same ensemble of classifiers and the same parameter settings are used in all datasets). The MATLAB code for the ensemble of classifiers will be publicly available3 ï¿½ 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Cortical and subcortical nuclei degenerate in the dementias, but less is known about changes in the white matter tracts that connect them. To better understand white matter changes in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD), we used a novel approach to extract full 3D profiles of fiber bundles from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and map white matter abnormalities onto detailed models of each pathway. The result is a spatially complex picture of tract-by-tract microstructural changes. Our atlas of tracts for each disease consists of 21 anatomically clustered and recognizable white matter tracts generated from whole-brain tractography in 20 patients with bvFTD, 23 with age-matched EOAD, and 33 healthy elderly controls. To analyze the landscape of white matter abnormalities, we used a point-wise tract correspondence method along the 3D profiles of the tracts and quantified the pathway disruptions using common diffusion metrics – fractional anisotropy, mean, radial, and axial diffusivity. We tested the hypothesis that bvFTD and EOAD are associated with preferential degeneration in specific neural networks. We mapped axonal tract damage that was best detected with mean and radial diffusivity metrics, supporting our network hypothesis, highly statistically significant and more sensitive than widely studied fractional anisotropy reductions. From white matter diffusivity, we identified abnormalities in bvFTD in all 21 tracts of interest but especially in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus, frontal callosum, anterior thalamic radiations, cingulum bundles and left superior longitudinal fasciculus. This network of white matter alterations extends beyond the most commonly studied tracts, showing greater white matter abnormalities in bvFTD versus controls and EOAD patients. In EOAD, network alterations involved more posterior white matter – the parietal sector of the corpus callosum and parahipoccampal cingulum bilaterally. Widespread but distinctive white matter alterations are a key feature of the pathophysiology of these two forms of dementia. © 2015, The Author(s).},

abstract={The exploration and retrieval of words during category fluency involves different strategies to improve or maintain performance. Deficits in that task, which are common in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), mirror either impaired semantic memory or dysfunctional executive control mechanisms. Relating category fluency to tasks that place greater demands on either semantic knowledge or executive functions might help to determine the underlying cognitive process. The aims of this study were to compare performance and strategy use of 20 patients with aMCI to 30 healthy elderly controls (HC) and to identify the dominant component (either executive or semantic) for better task performance in category fluency. Thus, the relationship between category fluency, design fluency and naming was examined. As fluency tasks have been associated with the superior frontal gyrus (SFG), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the temporal pole, we further explored the relationship between gray matter volume in these areas and both performance and strategy use. Patients with aMCI showed significantly lower performance and significantly less strategy use during fluency tasks compared to HC. However, both groups equally improved their performance when repeatedly confronted with the same task. In aMCI, performance during category fluency was significantly predicted by design fluency performance, while in HC, it was significantly predicted by naming performance. In HC, volume of the SFG significantly predicted both category and design fluency performance, and strategy use during design fluency. In aMCI, the SFG and the IFG predicted performance during both category and design fluency. The IFG significantly predicted strategy use during category fluency in both groups. The reduced category fluency performance in aMCI seems to be primarily due to dysfunctional executive control mechanisms rather than impaired semantic knowledge. This finding is directly relevant to patients in the different stages of Alzheimer's disease as it links the known semantic fluency deficit in this population to executive functions. Although patients with aMCI are impaired in both performance and strategy use compared to HC, they are able to increase performance over time. However, only HC were able to significantly improve the utilization of fluency strategies in both category and design fluency over time. HC seem to rely more heavily on the SFG during fluency tasks, while in patients with aMCI additional frontal brain areas are involved, possibly reflecting compensational processes. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

abstract={In spite of the worldwide financial and research efforts made, the pathophysiological mechanism at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still poorly understood. Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Computer Aided Detection and Diagnosis, known as CAD, is a fundamental tool for assisting radiologists in the image interpretation task. Since the 1980s, its popularity has grown, and it has become an important area of research in computer science, generating a great amount of published papers and many software systems. A wide variety of computer algorithms, such as image processing techniques, classification systems and artificial intelligence approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), have been used in this field. CAD applications have extended to an increasing number of image modalities, as for example radiography, ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), mammography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) and to a great number of diseases, such as lung cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, spine cancer, aneurysm, interstitial lung diseases... In this paper, a review of the fundamentals of some of these CAD systems, with special emphasis on those schemes based on ANNs, will be conducted. An analysis of methods and results obtained in clinical practice and a report of the advantages derived from its use (mainly focused in mammography, thoracic and colonic CT) will also be presented. In the last section, a compilation of CAD papers related with medical education and specialists' training reveals that this area has not been developed by many researchers. CAD schemes with educational purposes have been created for learning patterns in error making by radiology trainees, identifying regions where false positive detection is more probable, and predicting case difficulty for improving the learning process. The use of Computer Aided Education related with CAD software and Content-based image retrieval techniques have also been utilized as methods for enhancing learning. © 2016 ACM.},

abstract={Whereas the cerebral cortex has long been regarded by neuroscientists as the major locus of cognitive function, the white matter of the brain is increasingly recognized as equally critical for cognition. White matter comprises half of the brain, has expanded more than gray matter in evolution, and forms an indispensable component of distributed neural networks that subserve neurobehavioral operations. White matter tracts mediate the essential connectivity by which human behavior is organized, working in concert with gray matter to enable the extraordinary repertoire of human cognitive capacities. In this review, we present evidence from behavioral neurology that white matter lesions regularly disturb cognition, consider the role of white matter in the physiology of distributed neural networks, develop the hypothesis that white matter dysfunction is relevant to neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease and the newly described entity chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and discuss emerging concepts regarding the prevention and treatment of cognitive dysfunction associated with white matter disorders. Investigation of the role of white matter in cognition has yielded many valuable insights and promises to expand understanding of normal brain structure and function, improve the treatment of many neurobehavioral disorders, and disclose new opportunities for research on many challenging problems facing medicine and society. © 2016 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract={Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) constitutes an important tool for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which, in turn, allows the application of treatments that can be simpler and more likely to be effective. This paper explores the construction of classification methods based on deep learning architectures applied on brain regions defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the classification architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/AD classification, 0.84 and AUC of 0.91 for stable MCI/AD classification and 0.83 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/MCI converters classification. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

abstract={The assessment of in vivo 18F images targeting amyloid deposition is currently carried on by visual rating with an optional quantification based on standardized uptake value ratio (SUVr) measurements. We target the difficulties of image reading and possible shortcomings of the SUVr methods by validating a new semi-quantitative approach named ELBA. ELBA involves a minimal image preprocessing and does not rely on small, specific regions of interest (ROIs). It evaluates the whole brain and delivers a geometrical/intensity score to be used for ranking and dichotomic assessment. The method was applied to adniimages 18F-florbetapir images from the ADNI database. Five expert readers provided visual assessment in blind and open sessions. The longitudinal trend and the comparison to SUVr measurements were also evaluated. ELBA performed with area under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.997 versus the visual assessment. The score was significantly correlated to the SUVr values (r = 0.86, p &lt; 10-4). The longitudinal analysis estimated a test/retest error of ≃2.3. Cohort and longitudinal analysis suggests that the ELBA method accurately ranks the brain amyloid burden. The expert readers confirmed its relevance in aiding the visual assessment in a significant number (85) of difficult cases. Despite the good performance, poor and uneven image quality constitutes the major limitation. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Automated study of brain sub-anatomic region like Corpus Callosum (CC) is challenging due to its complex topology and varying shape. The development of reliable Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems would help in the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and to perform drug trails to palliate the effect of AD. In this work, an attempt has been made to analyse the shape changes of CC using shape based Laplace Beltrami (LB) eigen value features and machine learning techniques. CC from the normal and AD T1-weighted magnetic resonance images are segmented using Reaction Diffusion (RD) level set method and the obtained results are validated against the Ground Truth (GT) images. Ten LB eigen values are extracted from the segmented CC images. LB eigen values are positive sequence of infinite series that describe the intrinsic geometry of objects. These values capture the shape information of CC by solving the eigen value problem of LB operator on the triangular meshes. The significant features are selected based on Information Gain (IG) ranking and subjected to classification using K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). The performance of LB eigen values in the AD diagnosis is evaluated using classifiers' accuracy, specificity and sensitivity measures. Results show that, RD level set is able to segment CC in normal and AD images with high percentage of similarity with GT. The extracted LB eigen values are found to show high difference in the mean values between normal and AD subjects with high statistical significance. The LB eigen modes λ2, λ7 and λ8 are identified as prominent features by IG based ranking. KNN is able to give maximum classification accuracy of 93.37% compared to linear SVM and NB classifiers. This value is observed to be high than the results obtained using geometric features. The proposed CAD system focuses solely on the geometric variations of CC extracted using LB eigen value spectrum. The extraction of eigen modes in the LB spectrum is easy to compute, does not involve too many parameters and less time consuming. Thus this CAD study seems to be clinically significant in the shape investigation of brain structures for AD diagnosis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Five minutes of EEG activity were recorded from 37 patients with dementia due to AD and 29 elderly controls. Our results showed that Cross-SampEn values were lower in the AD group than in the control one for all the interactions among EEG channels. This finding indicates that EEG activity in AD is characterized by a lower statistical dissimilarity among channels. Significant differences were found mainly for fronto-central interactions (p < 0.01, permutation test). Additionally, the application of graph theory measures revealed diverse neural network changes, i.e. lower CC and higher PL values in AD group, leading to a less efficient brain organization. This study suggests the usefulness of our approach to provide further insights into the underlying brain dynamics associated with AD. © 2016 IEEE.},

Higher FC between the parahippocampus, parietal cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus was observed in both AD and mild cognitive impairment compared to HC (false-discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05). The increase in FC between the parahippocampus and middle frontal gyrus was associated with reduced episodic memory in aMCI, independent of amyloid-beta positron emission tomography binding and apolipoprotein E ε4-carrier status. In conclusion, increased parahippocampal-prefrontal FC is predictive of impaired episodic memory in aMCI and may reflect a dysfunctional change within the episodic memory-related neural network. © 2016 Elsevier Inc..},

abstract={Cortical thinning patterns in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been widely reported through conventional regional analysis. In addition, the coordinated variance of cortical thickness in different brain regions has been investigated both at the individual and group network levels. In this study, we aim to investigate network architectural characteristics of a structural covariance network (SCN) in AD, and further to show that the structural covariance connectivity becomes disorganized across the brain regions in AD, while the normal control (NC) subjects maintain more clustered and consistent coordination in cortical atrophy variations. We generated SCNs directly from T1-weighted MR images of individual patients using surface-based cortical thickness data, with structural connectivity defined as similarity in cortical thickness within different brain regions. Individual SCNs were constructed using morphometric data from the Samsung Medical Center (SMC) dataset. The structural covariance connectivity showed higher clustering than randomly generated networks, as well as similar minimum path lengths, indicating that the SCNs are "small world." There were significant difference between NC and AD group in characteristic path lengths (z = -2.97, p < 0.01) and small-worldness values (z = 4.05, p < 0.01). Clustering coefficients in AD was smaller than that of NC but there was no significant difference (z = 1.81, not significant). We further observed that the AD patients had significantly disrupted structural connectivity. We also show that the coordinated variance of cortical thickness is distributed more randomly from one region to other regions in AD patients when compared to NC subjects. Our proposed SCN may provide surface-based measures for understanding interaction between two brain regions with co-atrophy of the cerebral cortex due to normal aging or AD. We applied our method to the AD Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) data to show consistency in results with the SMC dataset. © 2016 Kim, Shin, Han, Kim, Na, Seo, Seong and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.},

abstract={Synaptic dysfunction, a key pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), may account for abnormal memory-related EEG patterns in prodromal AD. Here, we investigate to what extent oscillatory EEG changes during memory encoding and/or retrieval enhance the accuracy of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in predicting conversion from amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) to AD. As expected, aMCI individuals that, within a 2-year follow-up period, developed dementia (N = 16) compared to healthy older (HO) (N = 26) and stable aMCI (N = 18) showed poorer associative memory, greater MTL atrophy, and lower capacity to recruit alpha oscillatory cortical networks. Interestingly, encoding-induced abnormal alpha desynchronized activity over the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) at baseline showed significantly higher accuracy in predicting AD than the magnitude of amygdala atrophy. Nevertheless, the best accuracy was obtained when the two markers were fitted into the model (sensitivity = 78%, specificity = 82%). These results support the idea that synaptic integrity/function in the PCC is affected during prodromal AD and has the potential of improving early detection when combined with MRI biomarkers. © The Author(s) 2016.},

abstract={Normative data for volumetric estimates of brain structures are necessary to adequately assess brain volume alterations in individuals with suspected neurological or psychiatric conditions. Although many studies have described age and sex effects in healthy individuals for brain morphometry assessed via magnetic resonance imaging, proper normative values allowing to quantify potential brain abnormalities are needed. We developed norms for volumetric estimates of subcortical brain regions based on cross-sectional magnetic resonance scans from 2790 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94 years using 23 samples provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software. Models predicting subcortical regional volumes of each hemisphere were produced including age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The mean explained variance by the models was 48%. For most regions, age, sex and eTIV predicted most of the explained variance while manufacturer, magnetic field strength and interactions predicted a limited amount. Estimates of the expected volumes of an individual based on its characteristics and the scanner characteristics can be obtained using derived formulas. For a new individual, significance test for volume abnormality, effect size and estimated percentage of the normative population with a smaller volume can be obtained. Normative values were validated in independent samples of healthy adults and in adults with Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={After decades of active research using in vivo functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), there has been numerous evidence that human brain functions emerge from and are realized by the interaction of multiple concurrent neural networks. Due to the lack of effective computational brain mapping approaches and the limitation of functional neuroimaging data quality/quantity, it is still challenging to faithfully and robustly reconstruct concurrent functional networks from fMRI data and to quantitatively investigate their interactions at network level. Therefore it is largely unknown how multiple interacting functional networks spatially overlap and jointly perform brain functions. In response, by developing innovative sparse representation of whole-brain fMRI signals, we found that many robust and reproducible functional networks, including both task-evoked and intrinsic connectivity networks, are simultaneously activated and distributed in distant neuroanatomic regions with substantially spatial overlaps, thus forming an initial collection of holistic atlases of functional networks and interactions (HAFNI). © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the ADNI dataset. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: The aim of this volumetric study was to explore the neuroanatomical correlates of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Delayed Matching-to-Sample - 48 items (DMS-48), two tests widely used in France to assess verbal and visual anterograde memory. We wanted to determine to what extent the two tests rely on the medial temporal lobe, and could therefore be predictive of Alzheimer's disease, in which pathological changes typically start in this region. Methods: We analysed data from a cohort of 138 patients with mild cognitive impairment participating in a longitudinal multicentre clinical research study. Verbal memory was assessed using the FCSRT and visual recognition memory was evaluated using the DMS-48. Performances on these two tests were correlated to local grey matter atrophy via structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry. Results: Our results confirm the existence of a positive correlation between the volume of the medial temporal lobe and the performance on the FCSRT, prominently on the left, and the performance on the DMS-48, on the right, for the whole group of patients (family-wise error, P < 0.05). Interestingly, this region remained implicated only in the subgroup of patients who had deficient scores on the cued recall of the FCSRT, whereas the free recall was associated with prefrontal aspects. For the DMS-48, it was only implicated for the group of patients whose performances declined between the immediate and delayed trial. Conversely, temporo-parietal cortices were implicated when no decline was observed. Within the medial temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus was prominently involved for the FCSRT and the immediate trial of the DMS-48, whereas the hippocampus was solely involved for the delayed trial of the DMS-48. Conclusions: The two tests are able to detect an amnestic profile of the medial temporal type, under the condition that the scores remain deficient after the cued recall of the FCSRT or decline on the delayed recognition trial of the DMS-48. Strategic retrieval as well as perceptual/attentional processes, supported by prefrontal and temporo-parietal cortices, were also found to have an impact on the performances. Finally, the implication of the hippocampus appears time dependent, triggered by a longer delay than the parahippocampus, rather than determined by the sense of recollection or the encoding strength associated with the memory trace. © 2016 Philippi et al.},

abstract={Modern e-health systems have undergone rapid development thanks to the advances in communications, computing and machine learning technology. Especially, deep learning has great superiority in image analysis and disease prediction. In this paper, we use Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as an example to show advantages of deep learning in diagnosing brain diseases and providing clinical decision support. Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), about 25% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The e-health field becomes more complete and effective owing to that. Our work helps predict AD at an early stage and take measures to slow down or even prevent the onset of it. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={Objective: Differentially worse performance on category versus letter fluency suggests greater semantic versus retrieval difficulties. This discrepancy, combined with reduced episodic memory, has widespread clinical utility in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our objective was to investigate whether changes in semantic processing, as measured by the discrepancy between category and letter fluency, was detectable in preclinical AD: in clinically normal older adults with abnormal β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition on positron emission tomography (PET) neuroimaging. Method: Clinically normal older adults (mean Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score = 29) were classified as Aβ+ (n = 70) or Aβ- (n = 205) using Pittsburgh Compound B-(PET) imaging. Participants completed letter fluency (FAS; word generation to letters F-A-S) and category fluency (CAT; word generation to animals, vegetables, fruits) annually (mean follow-up = 2.42 years). The effect of Aβ status on fluency over time was examined using linear mixed models controlling for age, sex, and education. To dissociate effects related to semantic (CAT) versus retrieval processes (CAT and FAS), we repeated models predicting CAT over time, controlling for FAS and likewise for CAT controlling for FAS. Results: At baseline, the Aβ+ group performed better on FAS compared with the Aβ- group but comparably on CAT. Longitudinally, the Aβ+ group demonstrated greater decline on CAT compared with the Aβ- group (p = .0011). This finding remained significant even when covarying for FAS (p = .0107). Aβ+ participants similarly declined compared with Aβ- participants on FAS (p = .0112), but this effect became insignificant when covarying for CAT (p = .1607). Conclusion: These findings provide biomarker validation for the greater specificity of declines in category versus letter fluency to underlying AD pathology. Our results also suggest that changes in semantic processing occur earlier in the AD trajectory than previously hypothesized.},

abstract={Neuroimaging provides for non-invasive evaluation of brain structure and activity and has been employed to suggest possible mechanisms for cognitive aging in humans. However, these imaging procedures have limits in terms of defining cellular and molecular mechanisms. In contrast, investigations of cognitive aging in animal models have mostly utilized techniques that have offered insight on synaptic, cellular, genetic, and epigenetic mechanisms affecting memory. Studies employing magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI and MRS, respectively) in animal models have emerged as an integrative set of techniques bridging localized cellular/molecular phenomenon and broader in vivo neural network alterations. MRI methods are remarkably suited to longitudinal tracking of cognitive function over extended periods permitting examination of the trajectory of structural or activity related changes. Combined with molecular and electrophysiological tools to selectively drive activity within specific brain regions, recent studies have begun to unlock the meaning of fMRI signals in terms of the role of neural plasticity and types of neural activity that generate the signals. The techniques provide a unique opportunity to causally determine how memory-relevant synaptic activity is processed and how memories may be distributed or reconsolidated over time. The present review summarizes research employing animal MRI and MRS in the study of brain function, structure, and biochemistry, with a particular focus on age-related cognitive decline. © 2016 Febo and Foster.},

Different types of neuroimaging have been developed to help such diagnosis, and significant research efforts are put into the automation and quantification of such diagnosis by computer algorithms over the past decades. In this paper we propose an ensemble learning framework to create effective models for AD/MCI related classification tasks from multiple modalities of neuroimaging and multiple baseline estimators. The framework is based on artificial neural networks and it resembles a composite model that solves the feature fusion learning problem as well as the prediction problem simultaneously, which targets at exploiting the prediction power of both fusing multiple data modalities and leveraging multiple mutually complementary classification models. We conduct extensive experiments on the well-known ADNI dataset and find that the proposed model works demonstrate advantages for both of the classification tasks studied. © 2016 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract={Background: Regarding the importance of right diagnosis in medical applications, various methods have been exploited for processing medical images solar. The method of segmentation is used to analyze anal to miscall structures in medical imaging. Objective: This study describes a new method for brain Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) segmentation via a novel algorithm based on genetic and regional growth. Methods: Among medical imaging methods, brains MRI segmentation is important due to high contrast of non-intrusive soft tissue and high spatial resolution. Size variations of brain tissues are often accompanied by various diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. As our knowledge about the relation between various brain diseases and deviation of brain anatomy increases, MRI segmentation is exploited as the first step in early diagnosis. In this paper, regional growth method and auto-mate selection of initial points by genetic algorithm is used to introduce a new method for MRI segmentation. Primary pixels and similarity criterion are automatically by genetic algorithms to maximize the accuracy and validity in image segmentation. Results: By using genetic algorithms and defining the fixed function of image segmentation, the initial points for the algorithm were found. The proposed algorithms are applied to the images and results are manually selected by regional growth in which the initial points were compared. The results showed that the proposed algorithm could reduce segmentation error effectively. Conclusion: The study concluded that the proposed algorithm could reduce segmentation error effectively and help us to diagnose brain diseases. © 2016, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

abstract={Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) occurs as a result of mild and accumulative brain damage. A prototype of rTBI is chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), which is a degenerative disease that occurs in patients with histories of multiple concussions or head injuries. Boxers have been the most commonly studied patient group because they may experience thousands of subconcussive hits over the course of a career. This study examined the consequences of rTBI with structural brain imaging and biomolecular imaging and investigated whether the neuropsychological features of rTBI were related to the findings of the imaging studies. Five retired professional boxers (mean age, 46.8 ± 3.19 years) and four age-matched controls (mean age, 48.5 ± 3.32 years) were studied. Cognitive-motor related functional impairment was assessed, and all subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation and behavioral tasks, as well as structural brain imaging and functional-molecular imaging. In neuropsychological tests, boxers showed deficits in delayed retrieval of visuospatial memory and motor coordination, which had a meaningful relationship with biomolecular imaging results indicative of neuronal injury. Morphometric abnormalities were not found in professional boxers by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Glucose metabolism was impaired in frontal areas associated with cognitive dysfunction, similar to findings in Alzheimer's disease. Low binding potential (BP) of 18F-flumazenil (FMZ) was found in the angular gyrus and temporal cortical regions, revealing neuronal deficits. These results suggested that cognitive impairment and motor dysfunction reflect chronic damage to neurons in professional boxers with rTBI. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2016.},

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a clinically, anatomically and biologically heterogeneous disorder encompassing a wide spectrum of cognitive profiles, ranging from the typical amnestic syndrome to visuospatial changes in posterior cortical atrophy, language deficits in primary progressive aphasia and behavioural/executive dysfunctions in anterior variants. With the emergence of functional imaging and neural network analysis using graph theory for instance, some authors have hypothesized that this phenotypic variability is produced by the differential involvement of large-scale neural networks – a model called ‘molecular nexopathy’. At the moment, however, the hypothesized mechanisms underlying AD’s divergent network degeneration remain speculative and mostly involve selective premorbid network vulnerability. Herein we present an overview of AD’s clinicoanatomical variability, outline functional imaging and graph theory contributions to our understanding of the disease and discuss ongoing debates regarding the biological roots of its heterogeneity. We finally discuss the clinical promises of statistical signal processing disciplines (graph theory and information theory) in predicting the trajectory of AD variants. This paper aims to raise awareness about AD clinicoanatomical heterogeneity and outline how statistical signal processing methods could lead to a better understanding, diagnosis and treatment of AD variants in the future. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central nervous system that has no cure and leads to death. One of the most prevalent tools for AD diagnosis is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because of its capability to visualize brain anatomical structures. There is a variety of classification methods for automatic diagnosis of AD, such as support vector machines, genetic algorithms, Bayes classifiers, neural networks, random forests, etc., but none of them provides robust information about the stage of the AD, they can just reveal the presence of disease. In this paper, a new approach for classification of MRI images using a fuzzy inference system is proposed. Two statistical moments (mean and standard deviation) of 116 anatomical regions of interests (ROIs) are used as input features for the classification system. A t-test feature selection method is used to identify the most discriminative ROIs. In order to evaluate the proposed system, MRI images from a database consisting of 818 subjects (229 normal, 401 mild cognitive impairment and 188 AD subjects) collected from the Alzheimer’s disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is analyzed. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) of the proposed fuzzy inference system fed by statistical input features are employed as the evaluation criteria with k-fold cross validation. The proposed system yields promising results in normal vs. AD classification with AUC of 0.99 on the training set and 0.8622±0.0033 on the testing set. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={Although measurement of total hippocampal volume is considered as an important hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), recent evidence demonstrated that atrophies of hippocampal subregions might be more sensitive in predicting this neurodegenerative disease. The vast majority of neuroimaging papers investigating this topic are focused on the difference between AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), not considering the impact of MCI patients who will or not convert in AD. For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal volume for discriminating these groups. Hippocampal subfields volumetry was extracted in 55 AD, 32 converted and 89 not-converted MCI (c/nc-MCI) and 47 healthy controls, using an atlas-based automatic algorithm based on Markov random fields embedded in the Freesurfer framework. To evaluate the impact of hippocampal atrophy in discriminating the insurgence of AD-like phenotypes we used three classification methods: Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayesian Classifier and Neural Networks Classifier. Taking into account only the total hippocampal volume, all classification models, reached a sensitivity of about 66% in discriminating between c-MCI and nc-MCI. Otherwise, classification analysis considering all segmenting subfields increased accuracy to diagnose c-MCI from 68% to 72%. This effect resulted to be strongly dependent upon atrophies of the subiculum and presubiculum. Our multivariate analysis revealed that the magnitude of the difference considering hippocampal subfield volumetry, as segmented by the considered atlas-based automatic algorithm, offers an advantage over hippocampal volume in distinguishing early AD from nc-MCI. © 2016 Bentham Science Publishers.

abstract={Retrieving medical images that present similar diseases is an active research area for diagnostics and therapy. However, it can be problematic given the visual variations between anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method for similarity computation in medical imaging. Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional molecular imaging, which helps to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), by evaluating cerebral metabolic rate of glucose after administration of (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)FDG). A quantitative evaluation, using computer aided methods, is of importance to improve medical care. In this paper a novel ranking method of the effectiveness of brain region of interest to classify healthy and AD brain is developed. Brain images are first segmented into 116 regions according to an anatomical atlas. A spatial normalization and four gray level normalization methods are used for comparison. Each extracted region is then characterized by a feature set based on gray level histogram moments, as well as age and gender of a subject. Using a receiver operating characteristic curve for each region, it was possible to define a Separating Power Factor (SPF) to rank region's ability to separate healthy from AD brain images. Using a set of selected regions, according to their rank, and when inputting them to a support vector machine classifier, it was possible to show that classification results were similar or slightly better than those obtained when using the whole gray matter voxels of the brain or the 116 regions as input features to the classifier. Computational time was reduced compared to the other methods to which our approach was compared. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ϵ4 allele is a well-established genetic risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Some evidence suggests a negative role of the ApoE ϵ4 allele for cognitive performance in late life, while beneficial effects on cognition have been shown in young age. We investigated age-related effects of the ApoE gene on brain function by assessing cognitive performance, as well as functional activation patterns during retrieval of Face-Name pairs in a group of young (n = 50; age 26.4±4.6 years, 25 ϵ4 carriers) and old (n = 40; age 66.1±7.0 years, 20 ϵ4 carriers) participants. A cross-sectional factorial design was used to examine the effects of age, ApoE genotype, and their interaction on both cognitive performance and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) brain response during retrieval of Face-Name pairs. While there were no genotype-related differences in cognitive performance, we found a significant interaction of age and ApoE genotype on task-related activation bilaterally in anterior cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, as well as left and right insula. Old age was associated with increased activity in ϵ4 carriers. The increased BOLD response in old ϵ4 carriers during retrieval could indicate a neurocognitive disadvantage associated with the ϵ4 allele with increasing age. Furthermore, recruitment of neuronal resources resulted in enhanced memory performance in young ϵ4 carriers, pointing to a better neurofunctional capacity associated with the ApoE4 genotype in young age. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={According to the UN World Health Organization, nearly one in every six of the world's population is affected by a neurological disorder. This research study focused on neural networks and analyzed the connections between neurological disorders defined by similar single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP). By utilizing the Genome-wide Association studies, SNPs associated with a select group of neurological disorders were identified. Drug molecules that target these SNPs were gathered from the DrugBank. The results showed that Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder were the most genetically similar based on the SNPs associated with them. Also, Schizophrenia had the highest number of SNPs associated with it as well as the highest betweenness rank. The gene TRNAI25 was the gene found among four of the disorders and it is implicated in various biological roles such as coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. The drug, Felodipine, targets two SNPs, one associated with Schizophrenia and the other with Bipolar Disorder. Neurological disorders are being visualized through patient CT or MRI scans; however, this study focused on the shared SNPs in different neurological disorders generated from preexisting data. With this project, genetic similarities were found within a select group of neurological disorders and may further biological research in neurological disorders through the use of network science. © 2016 IEEE.},

abstract={High-dimensional classification approaches have been widely used to investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for automatic classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper describes the use of t-test based feature-ranking approach as part of a novel feature selection procedure, where the number of top features is determined using the Fisher Criterion. The proposed classification system involves five systematic levels. First, voxel-based morphometry technique is used to compare the global and local differences of gray matter in patients with AD versus healthy controls (HCs). The significant local differences in gray matter volume are then selected as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel clusters are employed as VOIs, where each voxel is considered to be a feature. Third, all the features are ranked using t-test scores. In this regard, the Fisher Criterion between the AD and HC groups is calculated for a changing number of ranked features, where the vector size maximizing the Fisher Criterion is selected as the optimal number of top discriminative features. Fourth, the classification is performed using support vector machine. Finally, data fusion methods among atrophy clusters are used to improve the classification performance. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the proposed system could compete well with the state-of-the-art techniques reported in the literature. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Verbal fluency (VF) impairments occur early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to a lesser extent also in normal aging. However, the neural underpinnings of these impairments are not fully understood. The present study evaluated whether VF impairments in early AD and normal aging rely upon common or different neuroanatomical correlates. We examined the association between VF performance and brain structure in 18 mild AD patients and 24 healthy elderly. Linear regressions were performed between accuracy and time intervals in VF scores and structural measurements of cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) using MRI. Results showed that semantic VF correlated exclusively with GM in cerebellum, left temporal fusiform cortex, and WM in uncinate fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus callosum. Phonemic VF showed unique associations between intervals and WM in left-hemisphere tracts. The association between GM in hippocampus, subcortical structures and semantic accuracy differentiated patients from controls. Results showed that VF impairments are primarily associated with same structural brain changes in AD as in healthy elderly but at exaggerated levels. However, specific VF deficiencies and their underlying neural correlates exist and these clearly differentiate the initial stages of AD. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

The subjects consisted of patients with AD, and normal subjects are used as the control. Brain signals are recorded for 3 minutes in a relaxed condition and with eyes closed. The data is processed using power spectral analysis, brain mapping and chaos test to observe the level of complexity of EEG's data. The results show a shift in the power spectral in the low frequency band (delta and theta) in AD patients. The increase of delta and theta occurs in lobus frontal area and lobus parietal respectively. However, there is a decrease of alpha activity in AD patients where in the case of normal subjects with relaxed condition, brain alpha wave dominates the posterior area. This is confirmed by the results of brain mapping. While the results of chaos analysis show that the average value of MMLE is lower in AD patients than in normal subjects. The level of chaos associated with neural complexity in AD patients with lower neural complexity is due to neuronal damage caused by the beta amyloid plaques and tau protein in neurons. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is associated with underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and characterized by impaired single word retrieval and repetition of phrases and sentences. Objective: We set out to study whether logopenic aphasia is indeed the prototypic language profile in PPA patients with biomarker evidence of underlying AD pathology and to correlate language profiles with cortical atrophy patterns on MRI. Methods: Inclusion criteria: (I) clinical diagnosis of PPA; (II) CSF profile and/or PiB-PET scan indicative for amyloid pathology; (III) availability of expert language evaluation. Based on language evaluation, patients were classified as lvPPA (fulfilling lvPPA core criteria), lvPPA extended (fulfilling core criteria plus other language disturbances), or PPA unclassifiable (not fulfilling lvPPA core criteria). Cortical atrophy patterns on MRI were visually rated and quantitative measurements of cortical thickness were performed using FreeSurfer. Results: We included 22 patients (age 67±7 years, 50% female, MMSE 21±6). 41% were classified as lvPPA, 36% as lvPPA extended with additional deficits in language comprehension and/or confrontation naming, and 23% as PPA unclassifiable. By both qualitative and quantitative measurements, patients with lvPPA showed mild global cortical atrophy on MRI, whereas patients with lvPPA extended showed more focal cortical atrophy, predominantly at the left tempo-parietal side. For PPA unclassifiable, qualitative measurements revealed a heterogeneous atrophy pattern. Conclusion: Although most patients fulfilled the lvPPA criteria, we found that their language profiles were heterogeneous. The clinical and radiological spectrum of PPA due to underlying AD pathology is broader than pure lvPPA. © 2016 IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Objective: To explore a new index for reflecting the topological information of brain functional networks in patients at high risk of Alzheimer disease using characteristics of resting-state functional connectivity strengths(FCS) in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Methods: Thirty-one aMCI patients and 42 age, gender and years of education matched normal controls were enrolled between September 2009 and April 2011 in this study. The resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) data of all participants were acquired and preprocessed. Then the whole-brain functional connectivities were constructed for exploring the distribution characteristics of hub regions which had higher FCS values. Using two-sample t test to compare group differences in age, years of education and each neuropsychological assessment. In addition, using Chi-squared test to compare group differences in gender. Group differences in FCS values were analyzed by general linear model. Finally, correlation analyses were used to evaluate the relationships between the FCS values of the brain regions with group differences and behavioral scores in aMCI patients. Results: The hub regions of the functional networks in the aMCI patients were mainly located in the association cortices such as the precuneuses, posterior cingulate cortices, medial prefrontal cortices, angular gyri, superior occipital gyri, fusiform gyri and lingual gyri. The distribution models in the aMCI patients were consistent with those in the normal controls. However, the FCS values of these brain regions were significantly lower in the aMCI patients than those in the normal controls. In comparison to the normal controls, the aMCI patients had significantly decreased FCS values in the bilateral fusiform gyri, lingual gyri, superior occipital gyri, left middle occipital gyrus and postcentral gyrus (the cluster was 389, 230, 187 and 107 voxels, respectively: P<0.05, respectively), and they had decreased trends of FCS values in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortices and right insulas. The correlation analysis with uncorrected conditions showed that the FCS values of the left postcentral gyri were correlatid with the clock drawing test (CDT) scores (r=0.436, P=0.026). Conclusions: aMCI mainly attacks the hub regions of brain functional networks. The changes of functional connectivities in aMCI may reflect the early pathophysiologic alterations of AD.

abstract={IMPORTANCE Abnormal eating behaviors are common in patients with frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet their exact prevalence, severity, and underlying biological mechanisms are not understood. OBJECTIVE To define the severity of abnormal eating behavior and sucrose preference and their neural correlates in patients with behavioral variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic dementia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Forty-nine patients with dementia (19 with bvFTD, 15 with semantic dementia, and 15 with Alzheimer disease) were recruited, and their eating behavior was compared with that of 25 healthy controls. The study was conducted from November 1, 2013, through May 31, 2015, and data analyzed from June 1 to August 31, 2015. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients participated in an ad libitum breakfast test meal, and their total caloric intake and food preferences were measured. Changes in eating behavior were also measured using the Appetite and Eating Habits Questionnaire (APEHQ) and the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory (CBI). Sucrose preference was tested by measuring liking ratings of 3 desserts of varying sucrose content (A: 26%, B: 39%, C: 60%). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of whole-brain 3-T high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine the gray matter density changes across groups and their relations to eating behaviors. RESULTS Mean (SD) ages of patients in all 4 groups ranged from 62 (8.3) to 66 (8.4) years. At the ad libitum breakfast test meal, all patients with bvFTD had increased total caloric intake (mean, 1344 calories) compared with the Alzheimer disease (mean, 710 calories), semantic dementia (mean, 573 calories), and control groups (mean, 603 calories) (P < .001). Patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia had a strong sucrose preference compared with the other groups. Increased caloric intake correlated with atrophy in discrete neural networks that differed between patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia but included the cingulate cortices, thalami, and cerebellum in patients with bvFTD, with the addition of the orbitofrontal cortices and nucleus accumbens in patients with semantic dementia. A distributed network of neural correlates was associated with sucrose preference in patients with FTD. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Marked hyperphagia is restricted to bvFTD, present in all patients with this diagnosis, and supports its diagnostic value. Differing neural networks control eating behavior in patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia and are likely responsible for the differences seen, with a similar network controlling sucrose preference. These networks share structures that control cognitive-reward, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and visual modulation of eating behavior. Delineating the neural networks involved in mediating these changes in eating behavior may enable treatment of these features in patients with complex medical needs and aid in our understanding of structures that control eating behavior in patients with FTD and healthy individuals.},

Alzheimer's disease (AD) interferes with memory formation from the molecular level, to synaptic functions and neural networks organization. Here, we determined whether brain connectivity of resting-state networks correlate with memory in patients affected by AD and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). One hundred and forty-four subjects were recruited: 70 AD (MMSE Mini Mental State Evaluation 21.4), 50 MCI (MMSE 25.2) and 24 healthy subjects (MMSE 29.8). Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph core measures to obtain Small World parameters. eLORETA lagged linear connectivity as extracted by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was used to weight the network. A high statistical correlation between Small World and memory performance was found. Namely, higher Small World characteristic in EEG gamma frequency band during the resting state, better performance in short-term memory as evaluated by the digit span tests. Such Small World pattern might represent a biomarker of working memory impairment in older people both in physiological and pathological conditions. © 2015 IBRO.},

abstract={Background: Considering that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is untreatable, early diagnosis of AD from the healthy elderly controls (HC) is pivotal.However, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were not widely used due to its poor performance. Objective: Inspired from the eigenface approach for face recognition problems, we proposed an eigenbrain to detect AD brains. Eigenface is only for 2D image processing and is not suitable for volumetric image processing since faces are usually obtained as 2D images. Methods: We extended the eigenbrain to 3D. This 3D eigenbrain (3D-EB) inherits the fundamental strategies in either eigenface or 2D eigenbrain (2D-EB). All the 3D brains were transferred to a feature space, which encoded the variation among known 3D brain images. The feature space was named as the 3D-EB, and defined as eigenvectors on the set of 3D brains. We compared four different classifiers: feed-forward neural network, support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, polynomial (Pol) kernel, and radial basis function kernel. Results: The 50x10-fold stratified cross validation experiments showed that the proposed 3D-EB is better than the 2DEB. SVM with Pol kernel performed the best among all classifiers. Our "3D-EB + Pol-SVM" achieved an accuracy of 92.81%±1.99%, a sensitivity of 92.07%±2.48%, a specificity of 93.02%±2.22%, and a precision of 79.03%±2.37%. Based on the most important 3D-EB U1, we detected 34 brain regions related with AD. The results corresponded to recent literature. Conclusions: We validated the effectiveness of the proposed 3D-EB by detecting subjects and brain regions related to AD. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objectives: The objective was to review the literature on diffusion tensor imaging as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography (EEG) to unveil neuroanatomical and neurophysiological substrates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a brain neural network pathology affecting structural and functional cortical connectivity underlying human cognition. Methods: We reviewed papers registered in PubMed and other scientific repositories on the use of these techniques in amnesic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and clinically mild AD dementia patients compared to cognitively intact elderly individuals (Controls). Results: Hundreds of peer-reviewed (cross-sectional and longitudinal) papers have shown in patients with MCI and mild AD compared to Controls (1) impairment of callosal (splenium), thalamic, and anterior-posterior white matter bundles; (2) reduced correlation of resting state blood oxygen level-dependent activity across several intrinsic brain circuits including default mode and attention-related networks; and (3) abnormal power and functional coupling of resting state cortical EEG rhythms. Clinical applications of these measures are still limited. Conclusions: Structural and functional (in vivo) cortical connectivity measures represent a reliable marker of cerebral reserve capacity and should be used to predict and monitor the evolution of AD and its relative impact on cognitive domains in pre-clinical, prodromal, and dementia stages of AD. © The International Neuropsychological Society 2016.},

abstract={Content-based medical image retrieval (CBMIR) is an active research area for disease diagnosis and treatment but it can be problematic given the small visual variations between anatomical structures. We propose a retrieval method based on a bag-of-visual-words (BoVW) to identify discriminative characteristics between different medical images with Pruned Dictionary based on Latent Semantic Topic description. We refer to this as the PD-LST retrieval. Our method has two main components. First, we calculate a topic-word significance value for each visual word given a certain latent topic to evaluate how the word is connected to this latent topic. The latent topics are learnt, based on the relationship between the images and words, and are employed to bridge the gap between low-level visual features and high-level semantics. These latent topics describe the images and words semantically and can thus facilitate more meaningful comparisons between the words. Second, we compute an overall-word significance value to evaluate the significance of a visual word within the entire dictionary. We designed an iterative ranking method to measure overall-word significance by considering the relationship between all latent topics and words. The words with higher values are considered meaningful with more significant discriminative power in differentiating medical images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets and it showed improved retrieval accuracy and efficiency. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop progressive language, visuoperceptual, attentional, and oculomotor changes that can have an impact on their reading comprehension. However, few studies have examined reading behavior in AD, and none have examined the contribution of predictive cueing in reading performance. For this purpose we analyzed the eye movement behavior of 35 healthy readers (Controls) and 35 patients with probable AD during reading of regular and highpredictable sentences. The cloze predictability of words N- 1, and N+ 1 exerted an influence on the reader's gaze duration. The predictabilities of preceding words in high-predictable sentences served as task-appropriate cues that were used by Control readers. In contrast, these effects were not present in AD patients. In Controls, changes in predictability significantly affected fixation duration along the sentence; noteworthy, these changes did not affect fixation durations in AD patients. Hence, only in healthy readers did predictability of upcoming words influence fixation durations via memory retrieval. Our results suggest that Controls used stored information of familiar texts for enhancing their reading performance and imply that contextual-word predictability, whose processing is proposed to require memory retrieval, only affected reading behavior in healthy subjects. In AD patients, this loss reveals impairments in brain areas such as those corresponding to working memory and memory retrieval. These findings might be relevant for expanding the options for the early detection and monitoring in the early stages of AD. Furthermore, evaluation of eye movements during reading could provide a new tool for measuring drug impact on patients' behavior. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Some studies have focused on pause production, revealing that patients make extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been attributed to lexical retrieval difficulties, but pausing may also reflect other forms of cognitive impairment as it increases with cognitive load. The aim of the present study was to analyze autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective, looking at pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our first objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of these changes. Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD and 15 matched cognitively normal controls underwent an ecological episodic memory task, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. Autobiographical discourse collected from the ecological episodic memory task was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup comparisons showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than controls overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses. The number of these specific pauses was positively correlated with patients' episodic memory performance. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis showed that, in the patient group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar area (BA 10) grey matter density. This region may therefore play an important role in the planning of autobiographical discourse production. These findings demonstrate that pauses in early AD may reflect a compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel and memory retrieval. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging technique attracting increasing attention in dementia diagnosis only beginning from recent years. ASL is capable to provide direct and quantitative measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) of scanned patients, so that brain atrophy of demented patients could be revealed by measured low CBF within certain brain regions through ASL. However, partial volume effects (PVE) mainly caused by signal cross-contamination due to pixel heterogeneity and limited spatial resolution of ASL, often prevents CBF from being precisely measured. Inaccurate CBF is prone to mislead and even deteriorate dementia disease diagnosis results, thereafter. In this paper, a novel dementia disease diagnosis strategy based on ASL is proposed for the first time. The diagnosis strategy is composed of two steps: 1) to conduct pixel-wise PVE correction on original ASL images and 2) to predict dementia disease severities based on corrected ASL images via ranking. Extensive experiments and comprehensive statistical analysis are carried out to demonstrate the superiority of the new strategy with comparison to several existing ones. Promising results are reported from the statistical point of view. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging is of importance for diagnosing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer Disease (AD). Computer-aided diagnosis methods could process and analyze quantitatively these images, in order to better characterize and extract meaningful information for medical diagnosis. This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis technique for brain PET images classification in the case of AD. Brain images are first segmented into 116 Regions Of Interest (ROI) using an atlas. Computing some statistical features (mean, standard-deviation, skewness, kurtosis and entropy) on these regions' histogram, we define a Separation Power Factor (SPF) associated to each region. This factor quantifies the ability of each region to separate AD from Healthy Control (HC) brain images. Ranking selected regions according to their SPF and inputting them to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, yields the same or slightly better classification results than when inputting the whole brain voxels or the 116 regions, but with less computational time. Comparison is also done using Random Forest classifier. © 2015 AGBM.},

abstract={Episodic memory impairment represents one of the hallmark clinical features of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributable to the degeneration of medial temporal and parietal regions of the brain. In contrast, a somewhat paradoxical profile of relatively intact episodic memory, particularly for non-verbal material, is observed in semantic dementia (SD), despite marked atrophy of the hippocampus. This retrospective study investigated the neural substrates of episodic memory retrieval in 20 patients with a diagnosis of SD and 21 disease-matched cases of AD and compared their performance to that of 35 age- and education-matched healthy older Controls. Participants completed the Rey Complex Figure and the memory subscale of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised as indices of visual and verbal episodic recall, respectively. Relative to Controls, AD patients showed compromised memory performance on both visual and verbal memory tasks. In contrast, memory deficits in SD were modality-specific occurring exclusively on the verbal task. Controlling for semantic processing ameliorated these deficits in SD, while memory impairments persisted in AD. Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significant overlap in the neural correlates of verbal episodic memory in AD and SD with predominantly anteromedial regions, including the bilateral hippocampus, strongly implicated. Controlling for semantic processing negated this effect in SD, however, a distributed network of frontal, medial temporal, and parietal regions was implicated in AD. Our study corroborates the view that episodic memory deficits in SD arise very largely as a consequence of the conceptual loading of traditional tasks. We propose that the functional integrity of frontal and parietal regions enables new learning to occur in SD in the face of significant hippocampal and anteromedial temporal lobe pathology, underscoring the inherent complexity of the episodic memory circuitry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={In the past 5 years, imaging network properties in the brain of patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has revolutionized our understanding of this disorder. Postmortem data had already suggested that the damage spreads along functional neural networks, but postmortem studies do not provide information on the temporal evolution of the damage in the same patient, essential to determine spreading. These data can be provided by functional and structural neuroimaging, which allow for the visualization over time of the progressive damage inflicted by AD. Functional networks can be mapped by determining the synchrony across brain regions of the blood oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during quiet wakefulness. Other less extensively used techniques are also useful. For instance, amyloid deposition can be imaged and its progression mapped to determine whether it follows brain networks, and, if so, which are affected earliest. Network patterns of neurobiological changes, including tau deposition, may prove critical to our understanding of the neurobiology of AD and therefore open the way for therapeutic interventions. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.},

abstract={Cognitive reserve (CR) is known to modulate the clinical features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This concept may be critical for the development of non-pharmacological interventions able to slow down patients' cognitive decline in the absence of disease-modifying treatments. We aimed at identifying the neurobiological substrates of CR (i.e., neural reserve) over the transition between normal aging and AD, by assessing the underlying brain networks and their topological properties. A cohort of 154 participants (n=68 with AD, n=61 with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 healthy subjects) underwent resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing. Within each group, participants were classified as having high or low CR, and functional connectivity measures were compared, within group, between high and low CR individuals. Network-based statistics and topological network properties derived from graph theory were explored. Connectivity differences between high and low CR were evident only for aMCI patients, with participants with high CR showing a significant increase of connectivity in a network involving mainly fronto-parietal nodes. Conversely, they showed significantly decreased connectivity in a network involving fronto-temporo-cerebellar nodes. Consistently, changes to topological measures were observed in either direction, and were associated with measures of global cognitive function. These findings support the hypothesis that CR impacts on neurodegenerative process in the early phase of AD only. In addition, they fit with the existence of a "neural reserve", characterized by specific neural networks and their efficiency. It remains to be demonstrated whether interventions later in life can modulate this "neural reserve". © 2017 - IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Dementia is a growing problem that affects elderly people worldwide. More accurate evaluation of dementia diagnosis can help during the medical examination. Several methods for computer-aided dementia diagnosis have been proposed using resonance imaging scans to discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (NC). Nonetheless, the computer-aided diagnosis is especially challenging because of the heterogeneous and intermediate nature of MCI. We address the automated dementia diagnosis by introducing a novel supervised pretraining approach that takes advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) for complex classification tasks. The proposal initializes an ANN based on linear projections to achieve more discriminating spaces. Such projections are estimated by maximizing the centered kernel alignment criterion that assesses the affinity between the resonance imaging data kernel matrix and the label target matrix. As a result, the performed linear embedding allows accounting for features that contribute the most to the MCI class discrimination. We compare the supervised pretraining approach to two unsupervised initialization methods (autoencoders and Principal Component Analysis) and against the best four performing classification methods of the 2014 CADDementia challenge. As a result, our proposal outperforms all the baselines (7% of classification accuracy and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve) at the time it reduces the class biasing. © 2016 David Cárdenas-Peña et al.},

abstract={Background: Memory impairment in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is traditionally considered to be mild and attributed to prefrontal cortex dysfunction. Recent studies, however, indicated that some patients can present with a memory impairment of the hippocampal type, showing storage and consolidation deficits in addition to the more executive/prefrontal related encoding and strategic difficulties. Objective: This study aimed to study the relationship between executive functions (EF) and memory processes in bvFTD via a data-driven approach. Method: Participants consisted of 71 bvFTD (among which 60.6% had a lumbar puncture showing non-Alzheimer biomarker profile) and 60 controls (among which 45% had amyloid imaging showing a normal profile). EF were assessed by the Frontal Assessment Battery, semantic/lexical verbal fluency tests, and forward/backward digit spans. Patients were split into amnestic (n=33) and non-amnestic (n=38) subgroups based on normative data (total recall score) from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). Relationships between FCSRT subscores and EF measures were explored through hierarchical clustering analysis, partial correlation analysis with an EF component, and automated linear modeling. Results: Convergent findings across the statistical approaches show that, overall, memory performance was independent from EF in bvFTD whereas the relationship was stronger in controls. Indeed, in bvFTD, memory performance did not cluster with EF, was not correlated with the EF component, and was only partially (4%-12.7%) predicted by EF. Discussion: These findings show that executive dysfunctions cannot solely explain the memory deficits occurring in bvFTD. Indeed, some patients present with a genuine amnesia affecting storage and consolidation abilities, which are independent from executive dysfunctions. On the clinical level, this study highlights the importance of revising the neuropsychological diagnosis criteria for bvFTD. © 2016-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The hippocampal complex is affected early in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Increasingly, altered functional connectivity of the hippocampus is recognized as an important feature of preclinical AD. Carriers of the APOEeɛ4 allele are at an increased risk for AD, which could lead to altered hippocampal connectivity even in healthy older adults. To test this hypothesis, we used a paired-associates memory task to examine differences in task-dependent functional connectivity of the anterior and posterior hippocampus in nondemented APOEeɛ4 carriers (n = 34, 18F) and noncarriers (n = 46, 31F). We examined anterior and posterior portions of the hippocampus separately to test the theory that APOEeɛ4-mediated differences would be more pronounced in the anterior region, which is affected earlier in the AD course. This study is the first to use a psychophysiological interaction approach to query the context-dependent connectivity of subregions of the hippocampus during a memory task in adults at increased genetic risk for AD. During encoding, APOEeɛ4 carriers had lower functional connectivity change compared to baseline between the anterior hippocampus and right precuneus, anterior insula and cingulate cortex. During retrieval, bilateral supramarginal gyrus and right precuneus showed lower functional connectivity change with anterior hippocampus in carriers. Also during retrieval, carriers showed lower connectivity change in the posterior hippocampus with auditory cortex. In each case, APOEeɛ4 carriers showed strong negative connectivity changes compared to noncarriers where positive connectivity change was measured. These differences may represent prodromal functional changes mediated in part by APOEeɛ4 and are consistent with the anterior-to-posterior theory of AD progression in the hippocampus. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Compromised retrieval of autobiographical memory (ABM) is well established in neurodegenerative disorders. The recounting of autobiographical events is inextricably linked to linguistic knowledge, yet no study to date has investigated whether tense use during autobiographical narration is disrupted in dementia syndromes. This study investigated the incidence of correct past tense use during ABM narration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 10) and semantic dementia (SD, n = 10) in comparison with healthy older Controls (n = 10). Autobiographical narratives were analysed for episodic content (internal/external) and classified according to tense use (past/present). Across both patient groups, use of the past tense was significantly compromised relative to Controls, with increased levels of off-target present tense verbs observed. Voxel-based morphometry analyses based on structural MRI revealed differential associations between past tense use and regions of grey matter intensity in the brain. Bilateral temporal cortices were implicated in the SD group, whereas frontal, lateral, and medial temporal regions including the right hippocampus emerged in AD. This preliminary study provides the first demonstration of the disruption of specific linguistic constructs during autobiographical narration in AD and SD. Future studies are warranted to clarify at what point in the disease trajectory such deficits in tense use emerge, and whether these deficits are a product or contributing factor in memory disruption in these syndromes. © 2015 The British Psychological Society},

abstract={Previous research has shown that there is considerable overlap in the neural networks mediating successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, little is known about how the relevant human brain regions interact during these distinct phases of memory or how such interactions are affected by memory deficits that characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that often precedes dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we employed multivariate Granger causality analysis using autoregressive modeling of inferred neuronal time series obtained by deconvolving the hemodynamic response function from measured blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time series data, in order to examine the effective connectivity between brain regions during successful encoding and/or retrieval of object location associations in MCI patients and comparable healthy older adults. During encoding, healthy older adults demonstrated a left hemisphere dominant pattern where the inferior frontal junction, anterior intraparietal sulcus (likely involving the parietal eye fields), and posterior cingulate cortex drove activation in most left hemisphere regions and virtually every right hemisphere region tested. These regions are part of a frontoparietal network that mediates top-down cognitive control and is implicated in successful memory formation. In contrast, in the MCI patients, the right frontal eye field drove activation in every left hemisphere region examined, suggesting reliance on more basic visual search processes. Retrieval in the healthy older adults was primarily driven by the right hippocampus with lesser contributions of the right anterior thalamic nuclei and right inferior frontal sulcus, consistent with theoretical models holding the hippocampus as critical for the successful retrieval of memories. The pattern differed in MCI patients, in whom the right inferior frontal junction and right anterior thalamus drove successful memory retrieval, reflecting the characteristic hippocampal dysfunction of these patients. These findings demonstrate that neural network interactions differ markedly between MCI patients and healthy older adults. Future efforts will investigate the impact of cognitive rehabilitation of memory on these connectivity patterns. © 2015 .},

abstract={Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a prediction model that integrated various image features and neuropsychological scores to yield a single estimate reflecting the probability of dementia. Method: A total of 130 subjects belong to Normal control group, AD group, and MCI group, were recruited in this study. For these subjects, the multiple features obtained from different modalities, including structural MRI morphometry (volume / shape), rs-fMRI, and neuropsychological assessment measures (NPA) were used to explore an optimal set of predictors of conversion from MCI to AD. Unlike previous studies using logistic regression analysis, a new method based on learning vector quantization (LVQ) and probabilistic neural network (PNN) is proposed to establish a prediction model. Results: We test the baseline, 1-year follow-up, and 2-year follow-up scans of 17 AD subjects (M/ F=5/12), 22 normal controls (NC; 13/9), 16 subjects that remain stable MCI (MCI-s; 11/5), and 4 subjects convert to AD within a given timeframe (MCI-c; 2/2). This study found that the proposed quantitative indicator provides well-behaving AD state estimates, corresponding well with the actual diagnosis. Conclusion: According to the results, all of the test data have the trend that decreased over time. It has the potential to establish an effective decision support and data visualization framework for improving AD diagnostics, allowing clinicians to rapidly analyze large quantities of diverse patient data and as a screening measure and evaluated tool in therapeutic trials. © 2016.},

abstract={Apathy is an uncertain nosographical entity, which includes reduced motivation, abulia, decreased empathy, and lack of emotional involvement; it is an important and heavy-burden clinical condition which strongly impacts in everyday life events, affects the common daily living abilities, reduced the inner goal directed behavior, and gives the heaviest burden on caregivers. Is a quite common comorbidity of many neurological disease, However, there is no definite consensus on the role of apathy in clinical practice, no definite data on anatomical circuits involved in its development, and no definite instrument to detect it at bedside. As a general observation, the occurrence of apathy is connected to damage of prefrontal cortex (PFC) and basal ganglia; "emotional affective" apathy may be related to the orbitomedial PFC and ventral striatum; "cognitive apathy" may be associated with dysfunction of lateral PFC and dorsal caudate nuclei; deficit of "autoactivation" may be due to bilateral lesions of the internal portion of globus pallidus, bilateral paramedian thalamic lesions, or the dorsomedial portion of PFC. On the other hand, apathy severity has been connected to neurofibrillary tangles density in the anterior cingulate gyrus and to gray matter atrophy in the anterior cingulate (ACC) and in the left medial frontal cortex, confirmed by functional imaging studies. These neural networks are linked to projects, judjing and planning, execution and selection common actions, and through the basolateral amygdala and nucleus accumbens projects to the frontostriatal and to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Therefore, an alteration of these circuitry caused a lack of insight, a reduction of decision-making strategies, and a reduced speedness in action decision, major responsible for apathy. Emergent role concerns also the parietal cortex, with its direct action motivation control. We will discuss the importance of these circuits in different pathologies, degenerative or vascular, acute or chronic. ï¿½ 2016 Moretti and Signori.},

abstract={MRI brain atlases are widely used for automated image segmentation, and in particular, recent developments in multi-atlas techniques have shown highly accurate segmentation results. In this study, we extended the role of the atlas library from mere anatomical reference to a comprehensive knowledge database with various patient attributes, such as demographic, functional, and diagnostic information. In addition to using the selected (heavily-weighted) atlases to achieve high segmentation accuracy, we tested whether the non-anatomical attributes of the selected atlases could be used to estimate patient attributes. This can be considered a context-based image retrieval (CBIR) approach, embedded in the multi-atlas framework. We first developed an image similarity measurement to weigh the atlases on a structure-by-structure basis, and then, the attributes of the multiple atlases were weighted to estimate the patient attributes. We tested this concept first by estimating age in a normal population; we then performed functional and diagnostic estimations in Alzheimer's disease patients. The accuracy of the estimated patient attributes was measured against the actual clinical data, and the performance was compared to conventional volumetric analysis. The proposed CBIR framework by multi-atlas voting would be the first step toward a knowledge-based support system for quantitative radiological image reading and diagnosis. © 2016 The Author(s)},

Recent years, many automatic diagnostic systems for examining EEG signals do exist. This paper proposes an automated system for analysing EEG signals using artificial neural networks to distinguish autism spectrum disorder subjects with normal subjects. We considered various statistical features of EEG signals as input for the proposed neural network model. The system is trained using back propagation neural network algorithm.

abstract={The presence of irregularities in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals entails complexities during the Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In addition, the uncertainty presented on EEG raises major issues in the improvement of the classification rate. The multi-resolution analysis through an optimum threshold will likely achieve better results in distinguishing AD and normal EEG signals. Hence, a fuzzy-entropy concept defined in a complex multi-resolution wavelet has been proposed to obtain the most appropriate threshold. First, the complex coefficients are fuzzified using a Gaussian membership function. Afterwards, the ability of the proposed fuzzy-entropy threshold has been compared with traditional thresholds in complex wavelet domain. Experimental results show that the authors' methodology produces a higher signal-to-noise ratio and a lower root-mean-square error than traditional approaches. Moreover, a neural network scheme is performed along several features to classify AD from normal EEG signals obtaining a specificity of 87.5%. © 2016 The Institution of Engineering and Technology.},

abstract={The association between verbal fluency deficit in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and deterioration of specific white matter (WM) tracts is currently not well understood. Using diffusion tensor imaging, we investigated a possible association between the left uncinate fasciculus, which has been implicated in word retrieval, and verbal fluency deficit in AD. A comparison of five properties of WM (fractional anisotropy, mode of anisotropy, mean diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and axial diffusivity) in 28 mild AD patients and 26 age-, gender-and education-matched healthy controls revealed significant group differences in a range of WM tracts. Looking specifically at diffusion parameters' values for the left uncinate fasciculus and verbal fluency scores in the AD group, we observed a positive trend between the letter fluency scores and mode of anisotropy values (r = 0.36, p = 0.55). Thus, our data suggest more global WM damage in mild AD, which also includes damage to the left uncinate fasciculus. However, damage to this particular tract is not robustly associated with verbal fluency decline at this stage of disease. © 2016 Vanja Kljajevic et al.},

First, triangulated surface meshes are extracted from segmented hippocampus structures in MRI and point-to-point correspondences are established among population of surfaces using a spectral matching method. Then, a deep learning variational auto-encoder is applied on the vertex coordinates of the mesh models to learn the low dimensional feature representation. A multi-layer perceptrons using softmax activation is trained simultaneously to classify Alzheimer’s patients from normal subjects.

abstract={Background: The choice of biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is important for improving the accuracy of imaging-based prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. The primary goal of this study was to assess the effects of imaging modalities and brain atlases on prediction. We also investigated the influence of support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) on predictive performance. Methods: Eighty individuals with amnestic MCI [40 developed AD within 3 years] underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans at baseline. Using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and LONI Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40), we extracted features representing gray matter density and relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in each region of interest from the baseline MRI and FDG-PET data, respectively. We used linear SVM ensemble with bagging and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure of classification performance. We performed multiple SVM-RFE to compute feature ranking. We performed analysis of variance on the mean AUCs for eight feature sets. Results: The interactions between atlas and modality choices were significant. The main effect of SVM-RFE was significant, but the interactions with the other factors were not significant. Comparison with existing method: Multimodal features were found to be better than unimodal features to predict AD. FDG-PET was found to be better than MRI. Conclusions: Imaging modalities and brain atlases interact with each other and affect prediction. SVM-RFE can improve the predictive accuracy when using atlas-based features. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

Computer aided diagnosis methods could process and analyze quantitatively these images, in order to better characterize and extract meaningful information for medical diagnosis. This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis technique for brain PET images classification in the case of AD. Brain images are first segmented into Regions Of Interest (ROI) using an atlas. Computing some statistical parameters on these regions, we define a Separation Power Factor (SPF) associated to each region. This factor quantifies the ability of each region to separate AD from Healthy Control (HC) brain images. Ranking selected regions according to their SPF and inputting them to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, yields better classification accuracy rate than when inputting the same number of ranked regions extracted from four others classical feature selection methods. © 2015 EURASIP.},

abstract={In this paper a custom classification algorithm based on linear discriminant analysis and probability-based weights is implemented and applied to the hippocampus measurements of structural magnetic resonance images from healthy subjects and Alzheimer's Disease sufferers; and then attempts to diagnose them as accurately as possible. The classifier works by classifying each measurement of a hippocampal volume as healthy control-sized or Alzheimer's Disease-sized, these new features are then weighted and used to classify the subject as a healthy control or suffering from Alzheimer's Disease. The preliminary results obtained reach an accuracy of 85.8% and this is a similar accuracy to state-of-the-art methods such as a Naive Bayes classifier and a Support Vector Machine. An advantage of the method proposed in this paper over the aforementioned state-of-the-art classifierst is the descriptive ability of the classifications it produces. The descriptive model can be of great help to aid a doctor in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease, or even further the understand of how Alzheimer's Disease affects the hippocampus. © 2015 IEEE.},

Computer-aided detection and diagnosis, based on medical imaging techniques is of importance for a quantitative evaluation. A novel method of ranking the effectiveness of brain regions to separate AD from healthy brains images is presented. Brain images are first mapped into 116 anatomical regions of interest. The first four moments and the entropy of the histograms of these regions are computed. Receiver Operating Characteristics curves are then used to rank the ability of regions to separate PET brain images. Twenty one selected regions are input to both Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers and evaluation is done on 142 brain PET images. Classification results are better than those obtained when using the whole 116 initial regions or when inputting the whole brain voxels. In addition, an important computational time reduction was obtained. © 2015 IEEE.},

abstract={The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be optimal for clinical trials to test potential treatments for preventing or delaying decline to dementia. However, MCI is heterogeneous in that not all cases progress to dementia within the time frame of a trial and some may not have underlying AD pathology. Identifying those MCIs who are most likely to decline during a trial and thus most likely to benefit from treatment will improve trial efficiency and power to detect treatment effects. To this end, using multimodal, imaging-derived, inclusion criteria may be especially beneficial. Here, we present a novel multimodal imaging marker that predicts future cognitive and neural decline from [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), amyloid florbetapir PET, and structural magnetic resonance imaging, based on a new deep learning algorithm (randomized denoising autoencoder marker, rDAm). Using ADNI2 MCI data, we show that using rDAm as a trial enrichment criterion reduces the required sample estimates by at least five times compared with the no-enrichment regime and leads to smaller trials with high statistical power, compared with existing methods. © 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.},

abstract={Purpose: Automated classification of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images has been an extensively researched topic in biomedical image processing. In this work, we propose a new approach for classifying normal and abnormal brain MR images using bi-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (BEMD) and autoregressive (AR) model Methods: In our approach, brain MR image is decomposed into four intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) using BEMD and AR coefficients from multiple IMFs are concatenated to form a feature vector. Finally a binary classifier, least-squares support vector machine (LS-SVM), is employed to discriminate between normal and abnormal brain MR images. Results: The proposed technique achieves 100% classification accuracy using second-order AR model with linear and radial basis function (RBF) as kernels in LS-SVM. Conclusions: Experimental results confirm that the performance of the proposed method is quite comparable with the existing results. Specifically, the presented approach outperforms one-dimensional empirical mode decomposition (1D-EMD) based classification of brain MR images. © 2015, Korean Society of Medical and Biological Engineering and Springer.},

Storytelling patterns may have diagnostic relevance and predict anatomic changes. The present study employed mixed methods discourse and quantitative analyses to delineate patterns of storytelling across focal neurodegenerative disease groups, and to clarify the neuroanatomical contributions to common storytelling characteristics. Transcripts of spontaneous social interactions of 46 participants (15 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 7 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 12 healthy older normal controls (NC)) were analyzed for storytelling frequency and characteristics, and videos of the interactions were rated for patients' level of social attentiveness. Compared to controls, svPPAs told more stories and autobiographical stories, and perseverated on aspects of self during the interaction, whereas ADs told fewer autobiographical stories than NCs. svPPAs and bvFTDs were rated as less attentive to social cues. Aspects of storytelling were related to diverse cognitive and socio-emotional functions, and voxel-based anatomic analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporal organization, narrative evaluations patterns, and social attentiveness correlated with atrophy corresponding to known intrinsic connectivity networks, including the default mode, limbic, salience, and stable task control networks. Differences in spontaneous storytelling among neurodegenerative groups elucidated diverse cognitive, socio-emotional, and neural contributions to narrative production, with implications for diagnostic screening and therapeutic intervention. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Associative memory is essential to everyday activities, such as the binding of faces and corresponding names to form single bits of information. However, this ability often becomes impaired with increasing age. The most important neural substrate of associative memory is the hippocampus, a structure crucially implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The main aim of this study was to compare neural correlates of associative memory in healthy aging and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an at-risk state for AD. We used fMRI to investigate differences in brain activation and connectivity between young controls (n = 20), elderly controls (n = 32) and MCI patients (n = 21) during associative memory retrieval. We observed lower hippocampal activation in MCI patients than control groups during a face-name recognition task, and the magnitude of this decrement was correlated with lower associative memory performance. Further, increased activation in precentral regions in all older adults indicated a stronger involvement of the task positive network (TPN) with age. Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed a stronger link of hippocampal and striatal components in older adults in comparison to young controls, regardless of memory impairment. In elderly controls, this went hand-in-hand with a stronger activation of striatal areas. Increased TPN activation may be linked to greater reliance on cognitive control in both older groups, while increased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the striatum may suggest dedifferentiation, especially in elderly controls. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={Background: Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have been published on the use of amyloid-β (Aβ) PET imaging with different 18F-radiopharmaceuticals for clinical characterization of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in different stages. However, distinct study cohorts and different quantification techniques allow only for an indirect comparison between the different tracers. Thus, the aim of this study was the direct intra-individual in vivo comparison of different Aβ-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging, including the newly developed agent [18F]FIBT. Methods: A small group of four animals of a well-characterized APP/PS1 transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD and gender-matched control (ctl) animals underwent a sequential and standardized PET imaging regimen for direct comparison of [18F]FIBT, [18F]florbetaben, and [11C]PiB. The quantitative PET imaging data were cross-validated with the cerebral Aβ plaque load as quantified ex vivo on histological sections. Results: We found that FIBT (2-(p-methylaminophenyl)-7-(2-[18F]fluoroethoxy)imidazo[2,1-b]benzothiazole) compares favorably to florbetaben as a high-contrasting PET radiopharmaceutical for imaging Aβ pathology. The excellent pharmacokinetics of FIBT in combination with its high-binding affinity towards Aβ resulted in feasible high-contrast imaging of Aβ with high global cortex to cerebellum standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 24-month-old tg mice (tg 1.68 ± 0.15 vs. ctl 0.95 ± 0.02). The SUVRs in transgenic versus control animals (SUVR<inf>tg</inf>/SUVR<inf>ctl</inf>) for FIBT (1.78 ± 0.16) were similar to the ratios as observed in humans (SUVR<inf>AD</inf>/SUVR<inf>ctl</inf>) for the established gold standard Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) (1.65 ± 0.41). Conclusions: This head-to-head PET tracer comparison study in mice indicated the good imaging properties of [18F]FIBT, such as high initial brain uptake, fast clearance of the brain, and high binding affinity towards Aβ as directly compared to the established amyloid tracers. Moreover, the preclinical study design is recommendable for reliable assessment and comparison of novel radiopharmaceuticals. © 2015, Hooshyar Yousefi et al.; licensee Springer.},

abstract={Age-related cognitive changes often include difficulties in retrieving memories, particularly those that rely on personal experiences within their temporal and spatial contexts (i.e., episodic memories). This decline may vary depending on the studied phase (i.e., encoding, storage or retrieval), according to inter-individual differences, and whether we are talking about normal or pathological (e.g., Alzheimer disease; AD) aging. Such cognitive changes are associated with different structural and functional alterations in the human neural network that underpins episodic memory. The prefrontal cortex is the first structure to be affected by age, followed by the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the parietal cortex and the cerebellum. In AD, however, the modifications occur mainly in the MTL (hippocampus and adjacent structures) before spreading to the neocortex. In this review, we will present results that attempt to characterize normal and pathological cognitive aging at multiple levels by integrating structural, behavioral, inter-individual and neuroimaging measures of episodic memory. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

We also found subtle reductions in gray matter in the right hippocampal formation in carriers of the risk variant.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common type of dementia among older people. The number of patients with AD will grow rapidly each year and AD is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In recent years, one of the main challenges for medical investigators has been the early diagnosis of patients with AD because an early diagnosis can provide greater opportunities for patients to be eligible for more clinical trials and they will have enough time to plan for future, medical and financial decisions. An established risk factor for AD is mild cognitive impairment (MCI) which is described as a transitional state between normal aging and AD patients. Hence an accurate and reliable diagnosis of MCI can be very effective and helpful for early diagnosis of AD. Therefore in this paper we present a novel and efficient method based on pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) for the diagnosis of MCI individuals from AD and healthy control (HC) groups using structural MRI. The proposed method uses PZMs to extract discriminative information from the MR images of the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Two types of artificial neural networks, which are based on pattern recognition and learning vector quantization (LVQ) networks, were used to classify the information extracted from the MRIs. We worked with 500 MRIs from the database of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1 1.5T). The 1 slice of 500 MRIs used in this study included 180 AD patients, 172 MCI patients, and 148 HC individuals. We selected 50 percent of the MRIs randomly for use in training the classifiers, 25 percent for validation and we used 25 percent for the testing phase. The technique proposed here yielded the best overall classification results between AD and MCI (accuracy 94.88%, sensitivity 94.18%, and specificity 95.55%), and for pairs of the MCI and HC (accuracy 95.59%, sensitivity 95.89% and specificity 95.34%). These results were achieved using maximum order 30 of PZM and the pattern recognition network with the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) back-propagation training algorithm as a classifier. © 2015 IBRO.},

Using event-related fMRI, we assessed differences in brain activation and functional connectivity during the encoding, maintenance and retrieval stages of a visual WM task with 3 levels of memory load in 17 adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 matched controls. The amount of information patients could store in WM was reduced at all memory load levels. During encoding, activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and extrastriate visual cortex, which in controls positively correlated with the amount of stored information, was reduced in patients. Additionally, patients showed disturbed functional connectivity between prefrontal and visual areas. During retrieval, right inferior VLPFC hyperactivation was correlated with hypoactivation of left VLPFC in patients during encoding. Visual WM encoding is disturbed by a failure to adequately engage a visual-prefrontal network critical for the transfer of perceptual information into WM. Prefrontal hyperactivation appears to be a secondary consequence of this primary deficit. Isolating the component processes of WM can lead to more specific neurophysiological markers for translational efforts seeking to improve the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia. ï¿½ The Author 2014.

abstract={Accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in possibly preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients. Among many research tasks, it is of a particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical deep learning methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Background: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with interrelated molecular, physiological, anatomical, biomarker, and cognitive dimensions. Methods: This article reviews the biological changes (genetic, molecular, and cellular) underlying AD and their correlation with the clinical syndrome. Results: Dementia associated with AD is related to the aberrant production, processing, and clearance of beta-amyloid and tau. Beta-amyloid deposition in brain follows a distinct spatial progression starting in the basal neocortex, spreading throughout the hippocampus, and eventually spreading to the rest of the cortex. The spread of tau pathology through neural networks leads to a distinct and consistent spatial progression of neurofibrillary tangles, beginning in the transentorhinal and hippocampal region and spreading superolaterally to the primary areas of the neocortex. Synaptic dysfunction and cell death is shown by progressive loss of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and progressive brain atrophy. Decreases in synapse number in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus correlate with declining cognitive function. Amyloid changes are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid and with amyloid imaging up to 20 years prior to the onset of symptoms. Structural atrophy may be detectable via magnetic resonance imaging up to 10 years before clinical signs appear. Conclusion: This review highlights the progression of biological changes underlying AD and their association with the clinical syndrome. Many changes occur before overt symptoms are evident and biomarkers provide a means to detect AD pathology even in patients without symptoms. © 2015 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Systems-based approaches to neuroscience, using network analysis and the human connectome, have been adopted by many researchers by virtue of recent progress in neuroimaging and computational technologies. Various neurological disorders have been evaluated from a network perspective, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and traumatic brain injury. Until now, dynamic processes after stroke and during recovery were investigated through multimodal neuroimaging techniques. Many studies have shown disruptions in structural and functional connectivity, including in large-scale neural networks, in patients with stroke sequela such as motor weakness, aphasia, hemianopia, neglect, and general cognitive dysfunction. A connectome-based approach might shed light on the underlying mechanisms of stroke sequela and the recovery process, and could identify candidates for individualized rehabilitation programs. In this review, we briefly outline the basic concepts of structural and functional connectivity, and the connectome. Then, we explore current evidence regarding how stroke lesions cause changes in connectivity and network architecture parameters. Finally, the clinical implications of perspectives on the connectome are discussed in relation to the cognitive and behavioral sequela of stroke. © 2015 Korean Stroke Society.},

abstract={Purpose: The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APO-E4) gene, a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease (AD), also modulates brain metabolism and function in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to explore cerebral metabolism using FDG PET in healthy APO-E4 carriers by comparing cognitively normal APO-E4 carriers to noncarriers and to assess if patterns of metabolism are correlated with performance on cognitive tasks. Moreover, metabolic connectivity patterns were established in order to assess if the organization of neural networks is influenced by genetic factors. Methods: Whole-brain PET statistical analysis was performed at voxel-level using SPM8 with a threshold of p < 0.005, corrected for volume, with age, gender and level of education as nuisance variables. Significant hypometabolism between APO-E4 carriers (n = 11) and noncarriers (n = 30) was first determined. Mean metabolic values with clinical/neuropsychological data were extracted at the individual level, and correlations were searched using Spearman’s rank test in the whole group. To evaluate metabolic connectivity from metabolic cluster(s) previously identified in the intergroup comparison, voxel-wise interregional correlation analysis (IRCA) was performed between groups of subjects. Results: APO-E4 carriers had reduced metabolism within the left anterior medial temporal lobe (MTL), where neuropathological changes first appear in AD, including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. A correlation between metabolism in this area and performance on the DMS48 (delayed matching to sample-48 items) was found, in line with converging evidence involving the perirhinal cortex in object-based memory. Finally, a voxel-wise IRCA revealed stronger metabolic connectivity of the MTL cluster with neocortical frontoparietal regions in carriers than in noncarriers, suggesting compensatory metabolic networks. Conclusion: Exploring cerebral metabolism using FDG PET can contribute to a better understanding of the influence of genetic factors on cerebral metabolism at both the local and network levels leading to phenotypical variations of the healthy brain and selective vulnerability. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={In the past 5 years, imaging network properties in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) has revolutionized our understanding of this disorder. Postmortem data had already suggested that the damage spreads along functional neural networks, but postmortem studies do not provide information on the temporal evolution of the damage in the same patient, essential to determine spreading. These data can be provided by functional and structural neuroimaging, which allow for the visualization over time of the progressive damage inflicted by AD. Functional networks can be mapped by determining the synchrony across brain regions of the blood oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during quiet wakefulness. Other less extensively used techniques are also useful. For instance, amyloid deposition can be imaged and its progression mapped to determine whether it follows brain networks, and, if so, which are affected earliest. Network patterns of neurobiological changes, including tau deposition, may prove critical to our understanding of the neurobiology of AD and therefore open the way for therapeutic interventions. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2015.

abstract={Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a central characteristic of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects, and has a high risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unknown how the EM network is modulated when a situation is switched. Twenty-six aMCI and twenty-two cognitively normal (CN) subjects were enrolled in this study. All of the subjects completed multi-dimensional neuropsychological tests and underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging scans during a resting-state and an episodic memory retrieval task state. The EM network was constructed using a seed-based functional connectivity (FC) approach. AMCI subjects showed poorer cognitive performances in the episodic memory and executive function. We demonstrated that connectivity of the left posterior parahippocampal gyrus (LpPHG) connected to the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex and the right postcentral gyrus (RPCG) was significantly decreased in aMCI subjects compared to CN subjects. Meanwhile, there was increased connectivity of the LpPHG to the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (RDMPFC), RPCG, left inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral superior parietal lobe in all of the subjects that changed from a resting-state to a task-state. Interestingly, the changed LpPHG-RDMPFC connectivity strength was significantly correlated with EM scores and executive function in the aMCI subjects. As a result, general brain regions are functionally organized and integrated into the EM network, and this strongly suggests that more cognitive resources are mobilized to meet the challenge of cognitive demand in the task state. These findings extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of EM deficits in aMCI subjects. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Introduction: Gender differences and menopause are associated with the cognitive decline and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although deficits of subcortical-cortical loops have been implicated in AD, no study has directly examined the resting-state brain functional alterations in postmenopausal women with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Methodology: Forty-eight subjects were recruited, including 15 older females with MCI, 13 older females without MCI, 10 older males with MCI and 10 older males without MCI. Full-scale neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate cognitive function. Resting-state fMRI and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach were used to investigate changes in the brain function in these subjects. A voxel-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA: gender x disease) was performed, and gender-brain-behavior relationships were further examined. Results: First, older females with MCI showed cognitive dysfunction in multiple domains compared to normal controls. Second, the brain function of subcortical-cortical loops was disrupted in older females with MCI. Finally, regional resting-state function of the left precuneus was significantly associated with altered episodic memory in these female patients. Conclusions: This study revealed the patterns of neural networks in older females with cognitive disorders, and may provide new ideas and evidence regarding the mechanism of cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women. © 2015, Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

abstract={The default mode network (DMN) typically comprises the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), precuneus, inferior parietal, hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) nodes. These regions are commonly reported more active during rest or during a task with little cognitive demand, as opposed to a cognitively demanding experimental task. Besides the pioneer application of PET, two other most recentlydeveloped imaging techniques to study DMN are diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to investigate structural connectivity and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) to look at functional connectivity. Based on RS-fMRI, the highly synchronized regions within DMN consisting of time courses of robust low-frequency (>0.1 Hz) blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations could be detected, and could represent the maintenance of baseline human cognition and metabolic equilibrium. DTI is a measure of the diffusion of water molecules, with the principle that movement of water molecules will diffuse along the direction of myelinated fiber bundles. Besides the neuronal activation and connectivity assessed by using RS-fMRI within DMN, DTI can reveal the axonal conductivity of white matter (WM) associated with neuronal activity in different cortical regions. Regions within DMN are of pivotal importance to daily life, including memory encoding, consolidation and retrieval, as well as environmental monitoring (posterior cingulate cortex, PCC and hippocampus); and higher-order cognitive and social functions (medial prefrontal cortex) such as self-relevance, rapid error identification, and social functions. DMN impairments have been found in several psychiatric disorders, including early Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) and autism. For instance, in AD, both RS-fMRI and DTI results confirmed reductions in functional and structural conductivity from the PCC and hippocampus to the whole brain as well as between these two regions, which might be primary factors in episodic memory impairment associated with early AD. The fiber tracts from DTI data indicated a significant correlation with the memory encoding and retrieval tests, suggesting that DTI and RS-fMRI information might be useful in identifying the earliest pathologic changes in the DMN in preclinical AD. Furthermore, a negative correlation between increased WM lesion load and RS-fMRI abnormalities in mild cognitive impairment patients suggested WM lesions may play an important role in cognitive decline secondary to decreased functional connectivity of DMN in the prodromal stage of dementia. In MTBI patients, in comparison to healthy control subjects, the integrity of DMN functional connectivity was disrupted, as evidenced by significantly reduced connectivity in the PCC and parietal regions, but increased frontal connectivity around the medial prefrontal cortex. The reduced posterior connectivity correlated clinically with neuro-cognitive dysfunction including cognitive flexibility, while the increased frontal connectivity correlated with posttraumatic symptoms (i.e., depression, anxiety, fatigue, and post-concussion syndrome). In autism, DMN dysfunction has been associated with decreased volumes of the structures involved, and was one of the key imaging features to be able to differentiate children with autism spectrum syndrome from typically developing children. Taken together, DMN connectivity with advanced imaging techniques enabled quantitative evaluations of neuronal activity and axonal conductivity for studying brain status at rest and under disease conditions. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

abstract={The default mode network (DMN) was originally identified in PET meta-analysis and describes a set of brain regions, the activity of which is greater at rest than compared with states of reduced consciousness, but also than compared with states of extroverted perception and action. DMN is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. The intrinsic neural activity of the brain manifests as spontaneous fluctuations of the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI signal. These BOLD fluctuations exhibit temporal synchrony within widely distributed brain regions known as resting-state networks. This is the review of the structural and functional connectivity of DMN, which has been clarified using PET, fMRI, EEG and MEG. Combining fMRI and EEG, the BOLD signal fluctuations were associated with six widely distributed resting state networks, and were correlated with the EEG power variations of delta, theta, alpha, beta and gamma rhythms. Spontaneous neuronal activity plays a fundamental role in brain function, using EEG and MEG; the stationary large-scale spontaneous interactions will be more evident by considering crossfrequency relationships. These results suggest the evidence of several brain rhythms within large-scale brain networks, and this chapter reviews oscillations in DMN in relation to cognition. DMN consists of multiple interacting subsystems, such as the medial temporal lobe subsystems, and the medial prefrontal subsystems. Raichle et al., first described it as a network comprised of posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, cuneus, temporo-parietal junction, prefrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Recent studies suggest that the hippocampus and frontopolar cortex is also included in this network. DMN is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. These characteristics show that DMN is important to evaluate brain development and neurological pathologies. Changes in the DMN and functional connectivity have been observed in autism, schizophrenia; Alzheimer's disease, temporal lobe epilepsy, and traumatic brain injured patients, and clinical conditions are associated with cognitive dysfunctions in domains that are linked to DMN. This chapter will also review the evidence of DMN that is disrupted in neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to cognitive-behavior dysfunctions, such as attention and memory. Processing of music is distributed across many brain regions including brainstem, thalamus, hippocampus, insula, auditory cortex, limbic system, and multimodal cortical association areas. These areas are known to participate in resting-state networks with hippocampus, cingulate cortex, a part of the default mode network. The music has modulating effects on resting-state networks and that may affect DMN. This chapter is adopted from our original article of experience-induced plasticity and DMN, and also refers to meditation and DMN. © 2015 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.},

Wavelet frame, a multi-scale image representation approach, is applied to extract features of different scales and directions from the processed grey matter image data. The features are extracted for both whole grey matter images and grey matter images of the hippocampus region. The support vector machine is adopted to construct classifiers for MCIc and MCI non-converters (MCInc). The accuracy using a leave-one-out procedure for classification of AD vs. NC and MCIc vs. MCInc is 84.13% and 76.69% respectively, both achieved by local hippocampus data.

abstract={Deficits in autobiographical memory appear earlier for recent than for remote life periods over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study aims to further our understanding of this graded effect by investigating the cognitive and neural substrates of recent versus remote autobiographical memories in patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) thanks to an autobiographical fluency task. 20 aMCI patients and 25 Healthy elderly Controls (HC) underwent neuropsychological tests assessing remote (20-to-30 years old) and recent (the ten last years) autobiographical memory as well as episodic and semantic memory, executive function and global cognition. All patients also had a structural MRI and an FDG-PET scan. Correlations were assessed between each autobiographical memory score and the other tests as well as grey matter volume and metabolism. Within the aMCI, performances for the remote period correlated with personal semantic memory and episodic memory retrieval whereas performances for the recent period only correlated with episodic memory retrieval. Neuroimaging analyses revealed significant correlations between performances for the remote period and temporal pole and temporo-parietal cortex volumes and anterior cingulate gyrus metabolism, while performances for the recent period correlated with hippocampal volume and posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal and hippocampus metabolism. The brain regions related with the retrieval of events from the recent period showed greater atrophy/hypometabolism in aMCI patients compared to HC than those involved in remote memories. Recall of recent memories essentially relies on episodic memory processes and brain network while remote memories also involve other processes such as semantic memory. This is consistent with the semanticization of memories with time and may explain the better resistance of remote memory in AD. © 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Logopenic progressive aphasia is one of the clinical presentations of primary progressive aphasia and formally defined by the co-occurrence of impaired naming and sentence repetition. Impaired naming is attributed to failure of lexical retrieval, which is a multi-staged process subserved by anatomically segregated brain regions. By dissecting the neurocognitive processes involved in impaired naming, we aimed to disentangle the clinical and neuroanatomical heterogeneity of this syndrome. Twenty-one individuals (66.7% females, age range 53-83 years) who fulfilled diagnostic criteria for logopenic variant and had at least two clinical and language assessments, 1 year apart, were recruited and matched for age, sex distribution and level of education with a healthy control sample (n=18). All participants underwent a structural brain scan at the first visit and surface-wise statistical analysis using Freesurfer. Seventeen participants with logopenic variant underwent amyloid imaging, with 14 demonstrating high amyloid retention. Based on their performance on single-word comprehension, repetition and confrontation naming, three subgroups of logopenic cases with distinctive linguistic profiles and distribution of atrophy were identified. The first subgroup (n=10) demonstrated pure anomia and left-sided atrophy in the posterior inferior parietal lobule and lateral temporal cortex. The second subgroup (n=6), presented additional mild deficits in single-word comprehension, and also exhibited bilateral thinning of the fusiform gyri. The third subgroup (n=5) showed additional impaired single-word repetition, and cortical thinning focused on the left superior temporal gyrus. The subgroups differed in the proportion of cases with high amyloid retention and in the rate of decline of naming performance over time, suggesting that neurodegeneration spreads differentially throughout regions subserving word processing. In line with previous reports, these results confirm the extensive damage to the language network and, in part, explain the clinical heterogeneity observed across logopenic cases. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

T whole brain imaging sequence, balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) that can achieve 0.4. mm isotropic images to study, in vivo, the anatomy of the hippocampal hilus. A detailed hippocampal subregional segmentation was performed according to anatomic atlases segmenting the following regions: CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, SRLM (stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare), alveus, fornix, and subiculum along with its molecular layer. We also segmented a hypointense structure centrally within the hilus that resembled the endfolial pathway. To validate that this hypointense signal represented the endfolial pathway, we acquired 0.1. mm isotropic 8-phase cycle bSSFP on an excised specimen, and then sectioned and stained the specimen for myelin using an anti-myelin basic protein antibody (SMI 94). A structure tensor analysis was calculated on the myelin-stained section to show directionality of the underlying fibers. The endfolial pathway was consistently visualized within the hippocampal body in vivo in all subjects. It is a central pathway in the hippocampus, with unknown relevance in neurodegenerative disorders, but now that it can be visualized noninvasively, we can study its function and alterations in neurodegeneration. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

Due to the pronounced heterogeneity of functional neuroimaging studies on episodic memory impairments in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD regarding their methodology and findings, we aimed to delineate consistent episodic memory-related brain activation patterns. We performed a systematic, quantitative, coordinate-based whole-brain activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comprising 292 MCI and 102 AD patients contrasted to 409 age-matched control subjects. We included episodic encoding and/or retrieval phases, investigated the effects of group, verbal or image stimuli and correlated mean Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores with the modelled activation estimates. MCI patients presented increased right hippocampal activation during memory encoding, decreased activation in the left hippocampus and fusiform gyrus during retrieval tasks, as well as attenuated activation in the right anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus during verbal retrieval. In AD patients, however, stronger activation within the precuneus during encoding tasks was accompanied by attenuated right hippocampal activation during retrieval tasks. Low cognitive performance (MMSE scores) was associated with stronger activation of the precuneus and reduced activation of the right (para)hippocampus and anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. This meta-analysis provides evidence for a specific and probably disease stage-dependent brain activation pattern related to the pathognomonic AD characteristic of episodic memory loss. © 2014, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Objective: This paper proposes a new, complex algorithm for the blind classification of the original electroencephalogram (EEG) tracing of each subject, without any preliminary pre-processing. The medical need in this field is to reach an early differential diagnosis between subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the healthy elderly (CTR) using only the recording and the analysis of few minutes of their EEG. Methods and material: This study analyzed the EEGs of 272 subjects, recorded at Rome's Neurology Unit of the Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico. The EEG recordings were performed using 19 electrodes, in a 0.3-70. Hz bandpass, positioned according to the International 10-20 System. Many powerful learning machines and algorithms have been proposed during the last 20 years to effectively resolve this complex problem, resulting in different and interesting outcomes. Among these algorithms, a new artificial adaptive system, named implicit function as squashing time (I-FAST), is able to diagnose, with high accuracy, a few minutes of the subject's EEG track; whether it manifests an AD, MCI or CTR condition. An updating of this system, carried out by adding a new algorithm, named multi scale ranked organizing maps (MS-ROM), to the I-FAST system, is presented, in order to classify with greater accuracy the unprocessed EEG's of AD, MCI and control subjects. Results: The proposed system has been measured on three independent pattern recognition tasks from unprocessed EEG tracks of a sample of AD subjects, MCI subjects and CTR: (a) AD compared with CTR; (b) AD compared with MCI; (c) CTR compared with MCI. While the values of accuracy of the previous system in distinguishing between AD and MCI were around 92%, the new proposed system reaches values between 94% and 98%. Similarly, the overall accuracy with best artificial neural networks (ANNs) is 98.25% for the distinguishing between CTR and MCI. Conclusions: This new version of I-FAST makes different steps forward: (a) avoidance of pre-processing phase and filtering procedure of EEG data, being the algorithm able to directly process an unprocessed EEG; (b) noise elimination, through the use of a training variant with input selection and testing system, based on naïve Bayes classifier; (c) a more robust classification phase, showing the stability of results on nine well known learning machine algorithms; (d) extraction of spatial invariants of an EEG signal using, in addition to the unsupervised ANN, the principal component analysis and the multi scale entropy, together with the MS-ROM; a more accurate performance in this specific task. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Objective: Past studies have shown that measures of attentional control and semantic memory are sensitive markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of established biomarkers of AD (cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta42, positron emission tomography Pittsburgh compound-B, and apolipoprotein E [APOE] genotype) on concurrent cognitive performance in cognitively normal individuals have been mixed. The present study examined the utility of combining attentional control with semantic retrieval as a sensitive correlate of AD biomarkers and used mediation analyses to examine possible mechanisms by which the biomarkers influence cognition. Method: Three hundred sixty-three participants completed a category verification task (CVT), and 113 of them concurrently underwent biomarker assessments. On each trial, participants viewed a category (e.g., "unit of time") and verified whether a subsequent target item was an exemplar of the category ("hour") or not ("clock"). Importantly, the nonmembers of the category were associatively related to the category (e.g., "clock" is not "a unit of time," but is highly related), and demanded attentional control to reject. Results: Accuracy to the foil items was the strongest discriminator between healthy aging and very mild symptomatic AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers had independent yet synergistic influence on CVT performance in cognitively healthy older adults. Furthermore, the influence of the biomarkers and APOE genotype was mediated primarily through increased levels of PIB. Conclusion: The combined influence of attentional control with semantic retrieval is a marker of symptomatic AD and a sensitive correlate of established biomarkers for AD risk in cognitively healthy participants. The biomarkers influenced cognition primarily through increased levels of amyloid in the brain. © 2014 American Psychological Association.},

abstract={Normal aging is associated with greater decline in associative memory relative to item memory due to impaired recollection. Familiarity may also contribute to associative recognition when stimuli are perceived as a 'unitized' representation. Given that familiarity is relatively preserved in older adults, we explored whether age-related associative memory deficits could be attenuated when associations were unitized (i.e., compounds) compared with those non-unitized (i.e., unrelated word pairs). Young and older adults performed an associative recognition task while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Behavioral results showed that age differences were smaller for recognition of compounds than for unrelated word pairs. ERP results indicated that only compounds evoked an early frontal old/new effect in older adults. Moreover, the early frontal old/new effect was positively correlated with associative discrimination accuracy. These findings suggest that reduced age-related associative deficits under unitized condition may be associated with the presence of familiarity-based retrieval of compounds in older adults. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for patient care and will be increasingly important as disease modifying agents become available, early in the course of the disease. Although studies have applied machine learning methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD, a bottleneck in the diagnostic performance was shown in previous methods, due to the lacking of efficient strategies for representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one setting and has the potential to require less labeled data. A performance gain was achieved in both binary classification and multiclass classification of AD. The advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are discussed. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Memory tests able to differentiate encoding and retrieval processes from the memoranda storing ones should be used to differentiate patients in a very early phase of AD. In fact, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be characterized by two different memory profiles: a pure amnestic one (with poor learning and retrieval and poor improvement when encoding is assisted and retrieval is facilitated) and a dysexecutive one (with inefficient encoding and/or poor retrieval strategies and improvement with assisted encoding and retrieval). The amnestic profile characterizes subjects affected by medio-temporal atrophy typical of AD. In this study, a Grober–Buschke memory procedure was used to evaluate normal controls and MCI patients with different cognitive profiles: pure amnestic (aMCIsd), amnestic plus other cognitive impairments (aMCImd) and non-amnestic (naMCI). An index of sensitivity of cueing (ISC) measured the advantage passing from free to cued recall. Results showed that both strategic and consolidation abilities were impaired in the aMCIsd and aMCImd groups and were preserved in the naMCI group. aMCImd, however, compensated the memory deficit with assisted encoding and retrieval, but aMCIsd performed very poorly. When MCI subjects were defined according to the ISC value, subjects with poor ISC were primarily in the aMCIsd group and, to a lesser extent, in the aMCImd group and the naMCI group. Finally, patients with a poor ISC showed cerebral atrophy documented in the precocious phase of AD and the retrosplenial cerebral areas seemed to be the most useful areas for identifying patients in the early phase of AD. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={There has been a growing need for in vitro models of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease that would enable a better understanding of etiology and faster development of treatment strategies. However, meeting this demand has been held back by the limited ability to mimic the in vivo microenvironment in an in vitro system. Here, we developed a microfluidic chip based on three-dimensional (3D) neurospheroids that more closely mimics the in vivo brain microenvironment by providing a constant flow of fluid that is readily observed in the interstitial space of the brain. Uniform neurospheroids, with cell-cell interactions and contacts in all directions, were formed in concave microwell arrays, and a slow interstitial level of flow was maintained using an osmotic micropump system. Using this platform, we investigated the effect of flow on neurospheroid size, neural network, and neural differentiation. Neurospheroids cultured with flow were larger and formed more robust and complex neural networks than those cultured under static conditions, suggesting an effect of the interstitial level of slow and diffusion-dominant flow on continuous nutrient, oxygen, and cytokine transport and removal of metabolic wastes. We also tested the toxic effects of amyloid-β, which is generally considered to be the major contributor in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-β treatment via an osmotic micropump significantly reduced the viability of neurospheroids and caused a significantly more destruction of neural networks, compared to the amyloid-β treatment under static conditions. By adding in vivo-like microenvironments, we propose this 3D culture-based microfluidic chip as an in vitro brain model for neurodegenerative disease and high-throughput drug screening.},

abstract={Introduction The long preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease provides opportunities for potential disease-modifying interventions in prodromal stages such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (anodal-tDCS), with its potential to enhance neuroplasticity, may allow improving cognition in MCI. Methods In a double-blind, cross-over, sham-controlled study, anodal-tDCS was administered to the left inferior frontal cortex during task-related and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess its impact on cognition and brain functions in MCI. Results During sham stimulation, MCI patients produced fewer correct semantic-word-retrieval responses than matched healthy controls, which was associated with hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal regions. Anodal-tDCS significantly improved performance to the level of controls, reduced task-related prefrontal hyperactivity and resulted in "normalization" of abnormal network configuration during resting-state fMRI. Discussion Anodal-tDCS exerts beneficial effects on cognition and brain functions in MCI, thereby providing a framework to test whether repeated stimulation sessions may yield sustained reversal of cognitive deficits. © 2015 The Alzheimer's Association.},

abstract={This paper presents medical image retrieval for Alzheimer’s disease based on information extracted from multiple time points. The aim is to analyze the retrieval performance directed by the information combination of different time points and from each time point separately. For each subject, Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) of four consecutive time points are obtained from ADNI database. Measurements of cortical and subcortical brain structures, including volumes and cortical thickness of the brain regions are used as features. The feature selection is performed aiming to select the most relevant features and reduce redundant and possibly noisy data. The evaluation is based on ten scenarios defined for separate time points and for a combination of multiple time points. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the retrieval performance gets better while using the time point that is more temporally distant from the baseline, regarding the scenarios in which separate information at any time point is used. When using a combination of multiple time points, the retrieval performance is improved only in the case when more than two time points are available and the selected features from the last two points are used. Feature selection algorithm leads to better results in all cases, while significantly reduces the feature vector dimensionality. The selected features are known as significant markers for Alzheimer’s Disease. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

abstract={Tests of generative semantic verbal fluency are widely used to study organization and representation of concepts in the human brain. Previous studies demonstrated that clustering and switching behavior during verbal fluency tasks is supported by multiple brain mechanisms associated with semantic memory and executive control. Previous work relied on manual assessments of semantic relatedness between words and grouping of words into semantic clusters. We investigated a computational linguistic approach to measuring the strength of semantic relatedness between words based on latent semantic analysis of word co-occurrences in a subset of a large online encyclopedia. We computed semantic clustering indices and compared them to brain network connectivity measures obtained with task-free fMRI in a sample consisting of healthy participants and those differentially affected by cognitive impairment. We found that semantic clustering indices were associated with brain network connectivity in distinct areas including fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal and fusiform gyrus regions. This study shows that computerized semantic indices complement traditional assessments of verbal fluency to provide a more complete account of the relationship between brain and verbal behavior involved organization and retrieval of lexical information from memory. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Analysis was conducted in areas with white matter lesions (WML) and all of white matter (WM). Results from 10-fold nested cross validation are reported as mean accuracy, precision, and recall with standard deviation in brackets. The best result we achieved was in the two-class problem NC versus AD + LBD with total accuracy of 0.98 (0.04). In the three-class problem AD versus LBD versus NC and the two-class problem AD versus LBD, we achieved 0.87 (0.08) and 0.74 (0.16), respectively. The performance using 3DT1 images was notably better than when using FLAIR images. The results from the WM region gave similar results as in the WML region.

abstract={We compare a variety of different anatomic connectivity measures, including several novel ones, that may help in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients from controls. We studied diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging from 200 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. We first evaluated measures derived from connectivity matrices based on whole-brain tractography; next, we studied additional network measures based on a novel flow-based measure of brain connectivity, computed on a dense 3-dimensional lattice. Based on these 2 kinds of connectivity matrices, we computed a variety of network measures. We evaluated the measures' ability to discriminate disease with a repeated, stratified 10-fold cross-validated classifier, using support vector machines, a supervised learning algorithm. We tested the relative importance of different combinations of features based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and feature ranking of the classification of 200 people into normal healthy controls and people with early or late mild cognitive impairment or AD. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Neuropathology suggests an important role for the locus coeruleus (LC) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Neuropathology and structural damage in the LC appears to be one of the earliest changes. We hypothesize that reduced functional integration of the LC reflected by lower brain functional connectivity contributes to early memory dysfunction. To test this, we examined resting-state functional connectivity from the LC in 18 healthy older individuals and 18 mildly cognitively impaired patients with possible AD. Connectivity measures were correlated with memory scores. The left LC showed strong connectivity to the left parahippocampal gyrus that correlated with memory performance in healthy persons. This connectivity was reduced in aMCI patients. Lateralization of connectivity-memory correlations was altered in less impaired aMCI patients: greater right LC-left parahippocampal gyrus connectivity was associated with better memory performance, in particular for encoding. Our results provide new evidence that the LC, in interaction with the parahippocampal gyrus, may contribute to episodic memory formation. They suggest functional impairment and the possibility that associated compensatory changes contribute to preserved memory functions in early AD. Structural and functional LC-related measures may provide early AD markers. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={We compared specific (i.e., associated with a unique time and space) and general (i.e., extended or repeated events) autobiographical memories (AbM) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The comparison aims at investigating the relationship between these two components of AbM across the lifespan and the volume of cerebral regions of interest within the temporal lobe. We hypothesized that the ability to elicit specific memories would correlate with hippocampal volume, whereas evoking general memories would be related to lateral temporal lobe. AbM was assessed using the modified Crovitz test in 18 patients with early AD and 18 matched controls. The proportions of total memories - supposed to reflect the ability to produce general memories - and specific memories retrieved were compared between AD patients and controls. Correlations to MRI volumes of temporal cortex were tested. We found different temporal patterns for specific and general memories in AD patients, with (i) relatively spared general memories, according to a temporal gradient that preserved remote memories, predominantly associated with right lateral temporal cortex volume. (ii) Conversely, the retrieval of specific AbMs was impaired for all life periods and correlated with bilateral hippocampal volumes. Our results highlight a shift from an initially episodic to a semantic nature of AbMs during AD, where the abstracted form of memories remains. © 2015 Nathalie Philippi et al.},

abstract={There is growing evidence that the human brain is a large scale complex network. The structural network is reported to be disrupted in cognitively impaired patients. However, there have been few studies evaluating the effects of amyloid and small vessel disease (SVD) markers, the common causes of cognitive impairment, on structural networks. Thus, we evaluated the association between amyloid and SVD burdens and structural networks using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Furthermore, we determined if network parameters predict cognitive impairments. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to DTI data from 232 cognitively impaired patients with varying degrees of amyloid and SVD burdens. All patients underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET to detect amyloid burden, MRI to detect markers of SVD, including the volume of white matter hyperintensities and the number of lacunes, and detailed neuropsychological testing. The whole-brain network was assessed by network parameters of integration (shortest path length, global efficiency) and segregation (clustering coefficient, transitivity, modularity). PiB retention ratio was not associated with any white matter network parameters. Greater white matter hyperintensity volumes or lacunae numbers were significantly associated with decreased network integration (increased shortest path length, decreased global efficiency) and increased network segregation (increased clustering coefficient, increased transitivity, increased modularity). Decreased network integration or increased network segregation were associated with poor performances in attention, language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal-executive functions. Our results suggest that SVD alters white matter network integration and segregation, which further predicts cognitive dysfunction. © 2015 -IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Concept formation is the ability to create an abstract link between dissimilar objects or thoughts and is crucial for abstract and creative thinking. This process is related to the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, given the altered performances reported in patients with frontal damage, particularly those suffering from the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. However, the cognitive mechanisms and neural bases of verbal concept formation are not clearly understood. The present study was aimed at addressing the following unresolved issues regarding concept formation in the field of neurology and cognitive neuroscience: (i) Are alterations in concept formation specific to frontotemporal dementia or are they also present in other cortical neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease? (ii) Is impaired performance in concept formation due to cortical lesions specific to frontotemporal dementia or to a cortico-subcortical frontal syndrome? and (iii) What are the cognitive mechanisms and neural bases underlying concept formation? To address these questions, we designed the Verbal Concept Formation Task, an experimental paradigm based on the similarities test. Patients presenting with severe frontal dysfunction (frontotemporal dementia, n = 18, and the Richardson form of progressive supranuclear palsy, n = 21) or with medial temporal pathology (amnestic mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, n = 14) and healthy participants (n = 18) were given the Verbal Concept Formation Task and a large battery of neuropsychological tests. In addition, all participants underwent 3D T1-weighted MRI to analyse grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Frontal patients were significantly impaired on the Verbal Concept Formation Task as compared to non-frontal participants (P = 0.00001). Global performance score was positively correlated with scores in cognitive tasks assessing executive functions and with grey matter volume in several areas, mostly in the frontal-basal-ganglion network. Two types of errors were observed in frontal patients. The most frequent was discriminating instead of grouping items ('linking deficit'). Patients also linked items on a concrete instead of an abstract basis ('abstraction deficit'). Linking and abstraction deficits were related to partially different areas: the linking deficit to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right middle frontal gyrus and both inferior parietal lobules and the abstraction deficit to the head of the caudate nuclei and the left superior frontal gyrus. These data suggest that verbal concept formation requires the integrity of the prefrontal-basal-ganglion functional network. In addition, it can be divided into two distinct cognitive processes, which are underlain by two partially different neural networks. © 2014 The Author (2014).

abstract={Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that can lead to progressive memory loss and cognition impairment. Therefore, diagnosing AD during the risk stage, a.k.a. Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), has attracted ever increasing interest. Besides the automated diagnosis of MCI, it is important to provide physicians with related MCI cases with visually similar imaging data for case-based reasoning or evidence-based medicine in clinical practices. To this end, we propose a multi-graph learning based medical image retrieval technique for MCI diagnostic assistance. Our method is comprised of two stages, the query category prediction and ranking. In the first stage, the query is formulated into a multi-graph structure with a set of selected subjects in the database to learn the relevance between the query subject and the existing subject categories through learning the multi-graph combination weights. This predicts the category that the query belongs to, based on which a set of subjects in the database are selected as candidate retrieval results. In the second stage, the relationship between these candidates and the query is further learned with a new multi-graph, which is used to rank the candidates. The returned subjects can be demonstrated to physicians as reference cases for MCI diagnosing. We evaluated the proposed method on a cohort of 60 consecutive MCI subjects and 350 normal controls with MRI data under three imaging parameters: T1 weighted imaging (T1), Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The proposed method can achieve average 3.45 relevant samples in top 5 returned results, which significantly outperforms the baseline methods compared. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Recently, there have been great interests for computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Unlike the previous methods that considered simple low-level features such as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI, and mean signal intensities from PET, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based latent feature representation with a stacked auto-encoder (SAE). We believe that there exist latent non-linear complicated patterns inherent in the low-level features such as relations among features. Combining the latent information with the original features helps build a robust model in AD/MCI classification, with high diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, thanks to the unsupervised characteristic of the pre-training in deep learning, we can benefit from the target-unrelated samples to initialize parameters of SAE, thus finding optimal parameters in fine-tuning with the target-related samples, and further enhancing the classification performances across four binary classification problems: AD vs. healthy normal control (HC), MCI vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI converter (MCI-C) vs. MCI non-converter (MCI-NC). In our experiments on ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the proposed method, showing the accuracies of 98.8, 90.7, 83.7, and 83.3 % for AD/HC, MCI/HC, AD/MCI, and MCI-C/MCI-NC classification, respectively. We believe that deep learning can shed new light on the neuroimaging data analysis, and our work presented the applicability of this method to brain disease diagnosis. © 2013, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Recently, several pattern recognition methods have been proposed to automatically discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimer's disease using different imaging modalities: sMRI, fMRI, PET and SPECT. Classical approaches in visual information retrieval have been successfully used for analysis of structural MRI brain images. In this paper, we use the visual indexing framework and pattern recognition analysis based on structural MRI data to discriminate three classes of subjects: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approach uses the circular harmonic functions (CHFs) to extract local features from the most involved areas in the disease: hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in each slice in all three brain projections. The features are quantized using the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach to build one signature by brain (subject). This yields a transformation of a full 3D image of brain ROIs into a 1D signature, a histogram of quantized features. To reduce the dimensionality of the signature, we use the PCA technique. Support vector machines classifiers are then applied to classify groups. The experiments were conducted on a subset of ADNI dataset and applied to the "Bordeaux-3City" dataset. The results showed that our approach achieves respectively for ADNI dataset and "Bordeaux-3City" dataset; for AD vs NC classification, an accuracy of 83.77% and 78%, a specificity of 88.2% and 80.4% and a sensitivity of 79.09% and 74.7%. For NC vs MCI classification we achieved for the ADNI datasets an accuracy of 69.45%, a specificity of 74.8% and a sensitivity of 62.52%. For the most challenging classification task (AD vs MCI), we reached an accuracy of 62.07%, a specificity of 75.15% and a sensitivity of 49.02%. The use of PCC visual features description improves classification results by more than 5% compared to the use of hippocampus features only. Our approach is automatic, less time-consuming and does not require the intervention of the clinician during the disease diagnosis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Aim. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease. Recently, computer scientists have developed various methods for early detection based on computer vision and machine learning techniques. Method. In this study, we proposed a novel AD detection method by displacement field (DF) estimation between a normal brain and an AD brain. The DF was treated as the AD-related features, reduced by principal component analysis (PCA), and finally fed into three classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM (GEPSVM), and twin SVM (TSVM). The 10-fold cross validation repeated 50 times. Results. The results showed the "DF + PCA + TSVM" achieved the accuracy of 92.75 ± 1.77, sensitivity of 90.56 ± 1.15, specificity of 93.37 ± 2.05, and precision of 79.61 ± 2.21. This result is better than or comparable with not only the other proposed two methods, but also ten state-of-the-art methods.

abstract={We studied the influence of emotions on autobiographical memory (AbM) in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), characteristically triggering atrophy in the hippocampus and the amygdala, two crucial structures sustaining memory and emotional processing. Our first aim was to analyze the influence of emotion on AbM in AD patients, on both the proportion and the specificity of emotional memories. Additionally, we sought to determine the relationship of emotional AbM to amygdalar-hippocampal volumes. Eighteen prodromal to mild AD patients and 18 age-matched healthy controls were included. We obtained 30 autobiographical memories per participant using the modified Crovitz test (MCT). Analyses were performed on global scores, rates and specificity scores of the emotional vs. neutral categories of memories. Amygdalar-hippocampal volumes were extracted from 3D T1-weighted MRI scans and tested for correlations with behavioral data. Overall, AD patients displayed a deficit in emotional AbMs as they elicited less emotional memories than the controls, however, the specificity of those memories was preserved. The deficit likely implied retrieval or storage as it was extended in time and without reminiscence bump effect. Global scores and rates of emotional memories, but not the specificity scores, were correlated to right amygdalar and hippocampal volumes, indicating that atrophy in these structures has a central role in the deficit observed. Conversely, emotional memories were more specific than neutral memories in both groups, reflecting an enhancement effect of emotion that could be supported by other brain regions that are spared during the early stages of the disease.},

Two main stages are required to obtain these features: segmentation and calculation of the quantitative measurements.

abstract={In this study, we wished to examine the relationship between the structural connectivity of the fornix, a white matter (WM) tract in the limbic system, which is affected in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and Alzheimer's disease, and the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of two key related subcortical structures, the thalamus, and hippocampus. Twenty-two older healthy controls (HC) and 18 older adults with aMCI underwent multi-modal MRI scanning. The fornix was reconstructed using constrained-spherical deconvolution-based tractography. The FC between the thalamus and hippocampus was calculated using a region-of-interest approach from which the mean time series were exacted and correlated. Diffusion tensor imaging measures of the WM microstructure of the fornix were correlated against the Fisher Z correlation values from the FC analysis. There was no difference between the groups in the fornix WM measures, nor in the resting-state FC of the thalamus and hippocampus. We did however find that the relationship between functional and structural connectivity differed significantly between the groups. In the HCs, there was a significant positive association between linear diffusion (CL) in the fornix and the FC of the thalamus and hippocampus, however, there was no relationship between these measures in the aMCI group. These preliminary findings suggest that in aMCI, the relationship between the functional and structural connectivity of regions of the limbic system may be significantly altered compared to healthy ageing. The combined use of diffusion weighted imaging and functional MRI may advance our understanding of neural network changes in aMCI, and elucidate subtle changes in the relationship between structural and functional brain networks. © 2015 Kehoe, Farrell, Metzler-Baddeley, Lawlor, Kenny, Lyons, McNulty, Mullins, Coyle and Bokde.},

abstract={The aim of the paper is to study medical image retrieval for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) on the bases of structural MRI measures. The main goal of the strategy used in this paper is to improve the retrieval performance while using smaller number of features. The feature vector consists of the measurements of cortical and subcortical brain structures, including volumes of the brain structures and cortical thickness. The feature subset selection is additionally applied using the Correlation-based Feature Selection method to exclude irrelevant, redundant or possibly noisy data and to consider the most relevant and discriminative features. Six different scenarios for the image representation are studied: volumetric features, cortical thickness features, all imaging features, selected volumetric features, selected cortical thickness feature and selected imaging features. Euclidean distance is used as a similarity measurement. The dataset used for evaluation of the retrieval performance is provided by the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Experimental results show that the strategy used in this research outperforms the traditional one despite its simplicity and small number of features used for representation. Additionally, the performed analysis demonstrated that the selected features are highly stable through the leave-one-out strategy. Moreover, they are stressed in the literature as significant biomarkers for Alzheimer’s Disease, which makes the strategy used in this research even more reasonable. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

abstract={Background: The aim of lexical retrieval treatment for people with anomia is not just to improve accessibility of lexical items for confrontation naming but to carry over this improvement to communicative situations. However, there is no consensus on what measures are the most suitable to evaluate whether such changes have occurred. Anomia is one of the core presenting symptoms for people with primary progressive aphasia (PPA), yet while there is increasing evidence for the efficacy of word retrieval treatments in PPA, there is minimal information about how improvements in picture naming transfer to connected speech. Aims: This paper evaluates a word retrieval treatment targeting personally relevant words conducted with two people with PPA, focusing on patterns of generalisation. Methods & Procedures: The study is a single-blind single-case experimental design. Participants and primary communication partners identified words related to two topics that are personally relevant for conversation. Participants completed three baseline and one or two post-test measures of their ability to produce these words in picture naming and a structured interview. Therapy activities lasting 10–15 min/day were carried out over a 2-week period at home, with participants viewing a picture of each target word on a computer screen together with its written and spoken name and repeating/reading the name. Half of the words from one topic were treated; a matched set of words from the treated topic and words from the untreated topic served as controls to allow us to assess generalisation within and across topic. Outcomes & Results: At post-test, the participants’ naming improved for the treated items, showing generalisation to different pictures of these items. There was neither generalisation to untreated items, nor to retrieval of the same words in a structured interview. Conclusions: Further research is required to understand the limits and the potential of word retrieval treatments to improve conversation in both acute-onset and progressive aphasia. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

abstract={The paper offers a new methodology for modelling, recognition and understanding of electroencephalography (EEG) spatio-temporal data measuring complex cognitive brain processes during mental tasks. The key element is that mental tasks are performed through complex spatio-temporal brain processes and they can be better understood only if we model properly the spatio-/spectro temporal data that measures these processes. The proposed methodology is based on a recently proposed novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube as a general framework for spatio-temporal brain data modelling. The methodology is demonstrated on benchmark cognitive EEG data. The new approach leads to a faster data processing, improved accuracy of the EEG data classification and improved understanding of this data and the cognitive processes that generated it. The paper concluded that the new methodology is worth exploring further on other spatio-temporal data, measuring complex cognitive brain processes, aiming at using this method for the development of the next generation of brain-computer interfaces and systems for early diagnosis of degenerative brain disease, such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD), and for personalised neuro-rehabilitation systems. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={The use of electroencephalograms (EEGs) to diagnose and analyses Alzheimer's disease (AD) has received much attention in recent years. The sample entropy (SE) has been widely applied to the diagnosis of AD. In our study, nine EEGs from 21 scalp electrodes in 3 AD patients and 9 EEGs from 3 age-matched controls are recorded. The calculations show that the kurtoses of the AD patients' EEG are positive and much higher than that of the controls. This finding encourages us to introduce a kurtosis-based de-noising method. The 21-electrode EEG is first decomposed using independent component analysis (ICA), and second sort them using their kurtoses in ascending order. Finally, the subspace of EEG signal using back projection of only the last five components is reconstructed. SE will be calculated after the above de-noising preprocess. The classifications show that this method can significantly improve the accuracy of SE-based diagnosis. The kurtosis analysis of EEG may contribute to increasing the understanding of brain dysfunction in AD in a statistical way. ï¿½ 2016 IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={The development of minimally invasive in vivo methods for imaging the brain has allowed for unprecedented advancement in our understanding of brain-behavior relationships. Structural, functional, and multimodal neuroimaging techniques have become more sophisticated in detecting structural and physiological abnormalities that may underlie various affective disorders and neurological illnesses such as depression in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In general, neuroimaging studies of depression in AD investigate whether depression is associated with damage to structures in specific neural networks involving frontal and subcortical structures or with functional disruption of cortical neural systems. This review provides an overview of how various imaging modalities have contributed to our understanding of the neurobiology of depression in AD. At present, the literature does not conclusively support any specific pathogenesis for depression, and it is not clear whether patients with AD and depression have histopathological and neurochemical characteristics that contribute to mood symptoms that are different from cognitively intact individuals with depression. Neuroimaging studies suggest that atrophy of temporal or frontal structures, white matter lesions in frontal lobe or subcortical systems, reduced activity in dorsolateral frontal cortex, or small vessel cerebrovascular disease may be associated with depression in AD. Conceptual, clinical, and methodological challenges in studying this relationship are discussed. Further work is needed to understand the specific brain structures, relevant white matter tracts, and interactions among them that are most important. This review concludes with potential directions for future research. © 2015 The authors and IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={The cognitive reserve hypothesis claims that the brain can overcome pathology by reinforcing preexistent processes or by developing alternative cognitive strategies. Epidemiological studies have revealed that this reserve can be built throughout life experiences as education or leisure activities. We previously showed that an early transient environmental enrichment (EE) durably improves memory performances in the Tg2576 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recently, we evidenced a hypersynchronous brain network activity in young adult Tg2576 mice. As aberrant oscillatory activity can contribute to memory deficits, we wondered whether the long-lasting memory improvements observed after EE were associated with a reduction of neuronal network hypersynchrony. Thus, we exposed non-transgenic (NTg) and Tg2576 mice to standard or enriched housing conditions for 10 weeks, starting at 3 months of age. Two weeks after EE period, Tg2576 mice presented similar seizure susceptibility to a GABA receptor antagonist. Immediately after and 2 weeks after this enrichment period, standard and enriched-housed Tg2576 mice did not differ with regards to the frequency of interictal spikes on their electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings. Thus, the long-lasting effect of this EE protocol on memory capacities in Tg2576 mice is not mediated by a reduction of their cerebral aberrant neuronal activity at early ages. ï¿½ 2015 Bezzina, Verret, Halley, Dahan and Rampon.},

abstract={EEG (electroencephalogram) has a lot of advantages compared to other methods in the analysis of Alzheimer’s disease such as diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease in an early stage. Traditional EEG analysis method needs a lot of artificial works such as calculating coherence between different pair of electrodes. In our work we applied deep learning network in the analysis of EEG data of Alzheimer’s disease to fully use the advantage of the unsupervised feature learning. We studied EEG based deep learning on 15 clinically diagnosed Alzheimer’s disease patients and 15 healthy people. Each person has 16 electrodes. The time domain EEG data of each electrode is cut into 40 data units according to the data size in a period. In our work we first train the deep learning network with 25 data units on each electrode separately and then test with 15 data units to get the accuracy on each electrode. Finally we will combine the learning results on 16 electrodes and train them with SVM and get a final result. We report a 92%accuracy after combining 16 electrodes of each person. In order to improve the deep learning model on Alzheimer’s disease with the upcoming new data, we use incremental learning to make full use of the existing data while decrease the expenses on memory space and computing time by replacing the exising data with new data. We report a 0.5% improvement in accuracy with incremental learning. © 2015, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

Brain images are first segmented into 116 regions according to an anatomical atlas. A spatial normalization and four grey level normalization methods are used for comparison. Each extracted region is then characterized by a feature set based on grey level histogram moments and age and gender. Using a receiver Operating Characteristic curve for each region, it was possible to rank region's ability to separate healthy from AD brain images. Using a set of selected regions, according to their rank, and when inputting them to a Support Vector Machine, it was possible to show that classification results were similar or slightly better to those obtained when using the whole voxels or the 116 regions as input features to the classifier. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={An important early event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aberrant polymerization and extracellular accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). In young transgenic mice expressing the human Aβ-precursor protein (APP), deposits of Aβ can be induced by the inoculation of minute amounts of brain extract containing Aβ aggregates ("Aβ seeds"), indicative of a prion-like seeding phenomenon. Moreover, focal intracerebral injection of Aβ seeds can induce deposits not only in the immediate vicinity of the injection site, but, with time, also in distal regions of the brain. However, it remains uncertain whether the spatial progression of Aβ deposits occurs via nonsystematic diffusion from the injection site to proximal regions or via directed transit along neuroanatomical pathways. To address this question, we analyzed the spatiotemporal emergence of Aβ deposits in two different APP-transgenic mouse models that had been previously inoculated with Aβ seeds into the hippocampal formation. The results revealed a specific, neuroanatomically constrained pattern of induced Aβ deposits in structures corresponding to the limbic connectome, supporting the hypothesis that neuronal pathways act as conduits for the movement of proteopathic agents among brain regions, thereby facilitating the progression of disease. © 2015 International Society of Neuropathology.},

Images together with clinical reports are returned that best match the presenting image. Work on query by image systems have been ongoing for more than two decades, predominately in fields outside of medical imaging. In these fields, features are often identified and used in the search for similar images. Corresponding strategies have been taken in medical imaging, especially MRI where it is reasonable to match based on a feature. However, in brain SPECT imaging, clinicians are often interested in the global pattern of brain activity for making diagnoses such as Small Vessel Disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Parkinson’s or Alzheimer’s Disease, which have some commonalities as “Global Brain Impairment” patterns. By utilizing robust spatial normalization methods to transform images to a common stereo-tactic space, we are able to use simple methods for measuring and ranking the closeness between the presenting image and images in the database. Our decomposition of the Brain SPECT dataset shows that images within the dataset have very high similarity. However, subtle differences can be reliably utilized for selecting best image matches.

abstract={The capacity to remember self-referential past events relies on the integrity of a distributed neural network. Controversy exists, however, regarding the involvement of specific brain structures for the retrieval of recently experienced versus more distant events. Here, we explored how characteristic patterns of atrophy in neurodegenerative disorders differentially disrupt remote versus recent autobiographical memory. Eleven behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, 10 semantic dementia, 15 Alzheimer's disease patients and 14 healthy older Controls completed the Autobiographical Interview. All patient groups displayed significant remote memory impairments relative to Controls. Similarly, recent period retrieval was significantly compromised in behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, yet semantic dementia patients scored in line with Controls. Voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging analyses, for all participants combined, were conducted to investigate grey and white matter correlates of remote and recent autobiographical memory retrieval. Neural correlates common to both recent and remote time periods were identified, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar cortices, and the forceps minor and left hippocampal portion of the cingulum bundle. Regions exclusively implicated in each time period were also identified. The integrity of the anterior temporal cortices was related to the retrieval of remote memories, whereas the posterior cingulate cortex emerged as a structure significantly associated with recent autobiographical memory retrieval. This study represents the first investigation of the grey and white matter correlates of remote and recent autobiographical memory retrieval in neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings demonstrate the importance of core brain structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, irrespective of time period, and point towards the contribution of discrete regions in mediating successful retrieval of distant versus recently experienced events.

abstract={Lifestyle modification offers a promising way of preventing or delaying Alzheimer's disease (AD). In particular, nutritional interventions can contribute to decrease the risk of dementia. The efficacy of such interventions should be assessed in individuals thought to be prone to AD. It is therefore necessary to identify markers that may help detecting AD as early as possible. This review will focus on subtle neuropsychological changes that may already exist in the predementia phase, and that could point to individuals at risk of dementia. Episodic memory decline appears consistently as the earliest sign of incipient typical AD. An episodic memory test that ensures deep encoding of information and assesses retrieval with free as well as cued recall appears as a useful tool to detect patients at an early stage of AD. Beyond the memory domain, category verbal fluency has been shown to decline early and to predict progression to AD. Moreover, in line with current diagnosis criteria for prodromal AD, combining neuropsychological scores and neuroimaging data allows a better discrimination of future AD patients than neuroimaging or neuropsychological data alone. Altogether, the detection of cognitive changes that are predictive of the typical form of probable AD already in the predementia stage points to at risk people who are the best target for therapeutic interventions, such as nutrition or physical exercise counseling or dietary interventions. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract={For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). 22Although it is clear from the context that the acronym DBM denotes "Deep Boltzmann Machine" in this paper, we would clearly indicate that DBM here is not related to "Deformation Based Morphometry"., a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs. healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter, we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively, outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model, we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={This study investigated the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on conjunctive and relational binding in episodic memory. Mild AD patients and controls had to remember item-color associations by imagining color either as a contextual association (relational memory) or as a feature of the item to be encoded (conjunctive memory). Patients' performance in each condition was correlated with cerebral metabolism measured by FDG-PET. The results showed that AD patients had an impaired capacity to remember item-color associations, with deficits in both relational and conjunctive memory. However, performance in the two kinds of associative memory varied independently across patients. Partial Least Square analyses revealed that poor conjunctive memory was related to hypometabolism in an anterior temporal-posterior fusiform brain network, whereas relational memory correlated with metabolism in regions of the default mode network. These findings support the hypothesis of distinct neural systems specialized in different types of associative memory and point to heterogeneous profiles of memory alteration in Alzheimer's disease as a function of damage to the respective neural networks. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={High levels of education, occupational complexity, and/or premorbid intelligence are associated with lower levels of cognitive impairment than would be expected from a given brain pathology. This has been observed across a range of conditions including Alzheimer's disease (Roe etal., 2010), stroke (Ojala-Oksala etal., 2012), traumatic brain injury (Kesler etal., 2003), and penetrating brain injury (Grafman, 1986). This cluster of factors, which seemingly protect the brain from expressing symptoms of damage, has been termed "cognitive reserve" (Stern, 2012). The current review considers one possible neural network, which may contribute to cognitive reserve. Based on the evidence that the neurotransmitter, noradrenaline mediates cognitive reserve's protective effects (Robertson, 2013) this review identifies the neurocognitive correlates of noradrenergic (NA) activity. These involve a set of inter-related cognitive processes (arousal, sustained attention, response to novelty, and awareness) with a strongly right hemisphere, fronto-parietal localization, along with working memory, which is also strongly modulated by NA. It is proposed that this set of processes is one plausible candidate for partially mediating the protective effects of cognitive reserve. In addition to its biological effects on brain structure and function, NA function may also facilitate networks for arousal, novelty, attention, awareness, and working memory, which collectively provide for a set of additional, cognitive, mechanisms that help the brain adapt to age-related changes and disease. It is hypothesized that to the extent that the lateral surface of the right prefrontal lobe and/or the right inferior parietal lobe maintain structural (white and gray matter) and functional integrity and connectivity, cognitive reserve should benefit and behavioral expression of pathologic damage should thus be mitigated. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Developments in tasks and imaging techniques applied over the last decades have yielded substantial support for the hypothesized role of the hippocampus in mnemonic processes. Human imaging research has now moved on to disentangle the contributions of the different hippocampal subregions and adjacent cortices, so as to bridge the gap between rodent and human data. Besides the importance of such studies for basic research, the investigation of hippocampal (dys)function has clinical relevance for diseases ranging from neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy to mental disorders such as schizophrenia or anxiety disorders. So far, most of the present review articles and books about the hippocampus and its functions focus on traditional declarative memory paradigms and 'encoding versus retrieval'. In this chapter we concentrate on a less travelled, but not less important, route concerning the role of the hippocampus in a well-established associative learning (encoding) paradigm: pavlovian fear conditioning. Fear conditioning is hypothesized to model aversive associative learning on a nonpathological level and is further assumed to recruit the same networks that are relevant for anxiety disorders, with the hippocampus being specific for contextual fear conditioning. We highlight the findings in humans by addressing its role in mediating spatial and temporal aspects of a context, involving different kinds of a fear-conditioning procedure (delay vs. trace conditioning), and its role in extinction, both from a theoretical and clinical perspective. © 2014 by S.

abstract={Many contemporary neuroscientific investigations face significant challenges in terms of data management, computational processing, data mining, and results interpretation. These four pillars define the core infrastructure necessary to plan, organize, orchestrate, validate, and disseminate novel scientific methods, computational resources, and translational healthcare findings. Data management includes protocols for data acquisition, archival, query, transfer, retrieval, and aggregation. Computational processing involves the necessary software, hardware, and networking infrastructure required to handle large amounts of heterogeneous neuroimaging, genetics, clinical, and phenotypic data and meta-data. Data mining refers to the process of automatically extracting data features, characteristics and associations, which are not readily visible by human exploration of the raw dataset. Result interpretation includes scientific visualization, community validation of findings and reproducible findings. In this manuscript we describe the novel high-throughput neuroimaging-genetics computational infrastructure available at the Institute for Neuroimaging and Informatics (INI) and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at University of Southern California (USC). INI and LONI include ultra-high-field and standard-field MRI brain scanners along with an imaging-genetics database for storing the complete provenance of the raw and derived data and meta-data. In addition, the institute provides a large number of software tools for image and shape analysis, mathematical modeling, genomic sequence processing, and scientific visualization. A unique feature of this architecture is the Pipeline environment, which integrates the data management, processing, transfer, and visualization. Through its client-server architecture, the Pipeline environment provides a graphical user interface for designing, executing, monitoring validating, and disseminating of complex protocols that utilize diverse suites of software tools and web-services. These pipeline workflows are represented as portable XML objects which transfer the execution instructions and user specifications from the client user machine to remote pipeline servers for distributed computing. Using Alzheimer's and Parkinson's data, we provide several examples of translational applications using this infrastructure1. © 2014 Dinov, Petrosyan, Liu, Eggert, Hobel, Vespa, Woo Moon, Van Horn, Franco and Toga.},

In other words, are there nonlinear indexes extracted from raw EEG data that are able to manifest the background difference among EEG? The response we give here is that a synthetic index of entropic complexity (Permutation Entropy, PE) as well as a measure of compressibility of the EEG can be used to discriminate among classes of subjects. An experimental database has been analyzed to make these measurements and the results we achieved are encouraging also in terms of disease evolution. Indeed, it is clearly shown that the condition of MCI has intermediate properties with respect to the analyzed markers: thus, these markers could in principle be used to evaluate the probability of transition from MCI to mild AD. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={The primary brain image segmentation goal is to partition a given brain image into different regions representing anatomical structures. Magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation is especially interesting because the accurate representation of white matter, grey matter and cerebrospinal fluid provides a way to identify many brain disorders, such as dementia, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper presents a fully unsupervised method for MRI segmentation based on Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In particular, the proposed method is based on five stages consisting of image acquisition, feature extraction, feature selection using evolutionary computation, voxel classification using SOM, and sharp map clustering. Moreover, a novel SOM clustering mechanism is presented that defines cluster borders by considering the output space and the relationship with the input space. This clustering mechanism accommodates spatial relationships using an entropy-gradient (EG) function calculation to group the units on the output space (SOM). The complete procedure does not use any a priori knowledge regarding voxel class assignment, but reveals a fully unsupervised, automated method for MRI segmentation to directly identify different tissue classes. Our algorithm was tested using images from the Internet Brain Image Repository (IBSR), outperforming the CGMM method in WM and CSF delineation, and was found to be the most effective among other techniques. Furthermore, this method provided excellent results using high-resolution MR images provided by the Nuclear Medicine Service of the "Virgen de las Nieves" Hospital (Granada, Spain). © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

abstract={Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have long investigated the hippocampus without differentiating between its subfields, even though theoretical models and rodent studies suggest that subfields support different and potentially even opposite functions. The CA3 region of the hippocampus has been ascribed a pivotal role both in initially forming associations during encoding and in reconstructing a memory representation based on partial cues during retrieval. These functions have been related to pattern separation and pattern completion, respectively. In recent years, studies using high-resolution fMRI in humans have begun to separate different hippocampal subregions and identify the role of the CA3 subregion relative to the other subregions. However, some of these findings have been inconsistent with theoretical models and findings from electrophysiology. In this review, we describe selected recent studies and highlight how their results might help to define different processes and functions that are presumably carried out by the CA3 region, in particular regarding the seemingly opposing functions of pattern separation and pattern completion. We also describe how these subfield-specific processes are related to behavioral, functional and structural alterations in patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. We conclude with discussing limitations of functional imaging and briefly outline possible future developments of the field. © 2014 Deuker, Doeller, Fell and Axmacher.},

abstract={In recent years, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has attracted significant attention as an indicator of high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the diagnosis of MCI can alert patient to carry out appropriate strategies to prevent AD. To avoid subjectivity in diagnosis, we propose an ontology driven decision support method which is an automated procedure for diagnosing MCI through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this approach, we encode specialized MRI knowledge into an ontology and construct a rule set using machine learning algorithms. Then we apply these two parts in conjunction with reasoning engine to automatically distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). The rule set is trained by MRI data of 187 MCI patients and 177 normal controls selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using C4.5 algorithm. By using a 10-fold cross validation, we prove that the performance of C4.5 with 80.2% sensitivity is better than other algorithms, such as support vector machine (SVM), Bayesian network (BN) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, and C4.5 is suitable for the construction of reasoning rules. Meanwhile, the evaluation results suggest that our approach would be useful to assist physicians efficiently in real clinical diagnosis for the disease of MCI. © 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={In human cognition, self and memory processes strongly interact, as evidenced by the memory advantage for self-referential materials [. Self-Reference Effect (SRE) and Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE)]. The current study examined this interaction at the behavioural level and its neural correlates in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for other-relevance (encoding phase). In a first experiment, the encoding and subsequent yes-no recognition phases were administrated in aMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Brain activation as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined during self-relevance judgements and anatomical images were used to search for correlation between the memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter density (GMD). In a second experiment, participants described the retrieval experience that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs recollective experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SRE and SRRE were impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore, verbal reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details, such as source memory in the HC participants, but less so in the AD patients. Our imaging findings revealed that both groups activated the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) at encoding during self-relevance judgements. However, the variable and limited memory advantage for self-related information was associated with GMD in the lateral prefrontal cortex in the AD patients, a region supporting high-order processes linking self and memory. These findings suggest that even if AD patients engage MPFC during self-referential judgements, the retrieval of self-related memories is qualitatively and quantitatively impaired in relation with altered high-order processes in the lateral PFC. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Reduced NMDA receptor functioning is hypothesized to underlie the cognitive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. However, because direct activation of the NMDA receptor is accompanied by neurotoxicity, mechanisms that activate the glycine co-agonist site on the NMDA receptor could carry greater therapeutic potential. In the current study, the effects of two glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1) inhibitors, RG1678 and ORG25935, were characterized in the object-retrieval detour (ORD) task in scopolamine-impaired rhesus monkeys and, using positron emission tomography (PET), the GlyT1 occupancy to efficacy relationship of each compound was established. Scopolamine exerted a significant decrease in accuracy in the ORD task. Lower doses of RG1678 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated the impact of scopolamine, whereas the highest dose tested (1.8 mg/kg) did not. The predicted GlyT1 occupancies of RG1678 at the effective doses were ~10 and 30 %. ORG25935 (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg, p.o.) also significantly attenuated the impact of scopolamine on the ORD task, whereas 3 mg/kg did not. The predicted GlyT1 occupancies of ORG25935 at the effective doses ranged from 16 to 80 %. These data suggest that GlyT1 inhibitors have the potential to improve performance on prefrontal cortex-dependent tests such as the ORD task, but that efficacy is lost when higher occupancies are achieved. Importantly, recent Ph2B data published by Roche suggests that low but not high doses of RG1678 improved negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia, highlighting the potential translational nature of the current preclinical findings. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract={Brain structures do not work in isolation; they work in concert to produce sensory perception, motivation and behavior. Systems-level network activity can be investigated by resting state magnetic resonance imaging (rsMRI), an emerging neuroimaging technique that assesses the synchrony of the brain's ongoing spontaneous activity. Converging evidence reveals that rsMRI is able to consistently identify distinct spatiotemporal patterns of large-scale brain networks. Dysregulation within and between these networks has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and drug addiction. Despite wide application of this approach in systems neuroscience, the physiological basis of these fluctuations remains incompletely understood. Here we review physiological studies in electrical, metabolic and hemodynamic fluctuations that are most pertinent to the rsMRI signal. We also review recent applications to neuropharmacology - specifically drug effects on resting state fluctuations. We speculate that the mechanisms governing spontaneous fluctuations in regional oxygenation availability likely give rise to the observed rsMRI signal. We conclude by identifying several open questions surrounding this technique.

Our method takes the form of convolutional neural networks, where the input and output are two volumetric modalities. The network contains a large number of trainable parameters that capture the relationship between input and output modalities. When trained on subjects with all modalities, the network can estimate the output modality given the input modality.

abstract={There is growing body of research devoted to designing imaging-based biomarkers that identify Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its prodromal stage using statistical machine learning methods. Recently several authors investigated how clinical trials for AD can be made more efficient (i.e., smaller sample size) using predictive measures from such classification methods. In this paper, we explain why predictive measures given by such SVM type objectives may be less than ideal for use in the setting described above. We give a solution based on a novel deep learning model, randomized denoising autoencoders (rDA), which regresses on training labels y while also accounting for the variance, a property which is very useful for clinical trial design. Our results give strong improvements in sample size estimates over strategies based on multi-kernel learning. Also, rDA predictions appear to more accurately correlate to stages of disease. Separately, our formulation empirically shows how deep architectures can be applied in the large d, small n regime--the default situation in medical imaging. This result is of independent interest.},

abstract={At a similar stage, patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) have greater neocortical but less medial temporal lobe dysfunction and atrophy than the late-onset form of the disease (LOAD). Whether the organization of neural networks also differs has never been investigated. This study aims at characterizing basal functional connectivity (FC) patterns of EOAD and LOAD in two groups of 14 patients matched for disease duration and severity, relative to age-matched controls. All subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify atrophy and resting-state FC focusing on : the default mode network (DMN), found impaired in earlier studies on AD, and the anterior temporal network (ATN) and dorso-lateral prefrontal network (DLPFN), respectively involved in declarative memory and executive functions. Patterns of atrophy and cognitive impairment in EOAD and LOAD were in accordance with previous reports. FC within the DMN was similarly decreased in both EOAD and LOAD relative to controls. However, a double-dissociated pattern of FC changes in ATN and DLPFN was found. EOAD exhibited decreased FC in the DLPFN and increased FC in the ATN relative to controls, while the reverse pattern was found in LOAD. In addition, ATN and DLPFN connectivity correlated respectively with memory and executive performances, suggesting that increased FC is here likely to reflect compensatory mechanisms. Thus, large-scale neural network changes in EOAD and LOAD endorse both common features and differences, probably related to a distinct distribution of pathological changes. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Objective Episodic memory retrieval is reliant upon cognitive control systems, of which 2 have been identified with functional neuroimaging: a cingulo-opercular salience network (SN) and a frontoparietal executive network (EN). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology is distributed throughout higher-order cortices. The hypotheses were that this frontoparietal pathology would impair activity associated with verbal memory recall; and that central cholinesterase inhibition (ChI) would modulate this, improving memory recall. Methods Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study normal participants and 2 patient groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. Activity within the EN and SN was observed during free recall of previously heard sentences, and related to measures of recall accuracy. Results In normal subjects, trials with reduced recall were associated with greater activity in both the SN and EN. Better recall was associated with greater activity in medial regions of the default mode network. By comparison, AD patients showed attenuated responses in both the SN and EN compared with either controls or MCI patients, even after recall performance was matched between groups. Following ChI, AD patients showed no modulation of activity within the SN, but increased activity within the EN. There was also enhanced activity within regions associated with episodic and semantic memory during less successful recall, requiring greater cognitive control. Interpretation The results indicate that in AD, impaired responses of cognitive control networks during verbal memory recall are partly responsible for reduced recall performance. One action of symptom-modifying treatment is partially to reverse the abnormal function of frontoparietal cognitive control and temporal lobe memory networks. © 2014 American Neurological Association.},

abstract={Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is believed to represent a transitional stage between normal healthy ageing and the development of dementia. In particular, aMCI patients have been shown to have higher annual transition rates to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) than individuals without cognitive impairment. Despite intensifying interest investigating the neuroanatomical basis of this transition, there remain a number of questions regarding the pathophysiological process underlying aMCI itself. A number of recent studies in aMCI have shown specific impairments in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), which is a group of regions strongly related to episodic memory capacities. However to date, no study has investigated the integrity of the DMN between patients with aMCI and those with a non-amnestic pattern of MCI (naMCI), who have cognitive impairment, but intact memory storage systems. In this study, we contrasted the DMN connectivity in 24 aMCI and 33 naMCI patients using seed-based resting state fMRI. The two groups showed no statistical difference in their DMN intra-connectivity. However when connectivity was analysed according to performance on measures of episodic memory retrieval, the two groups were separable, with aMCI patients demonstrating impaired functional connectivity between the hippocampal formation and the posterior cingulate cortex. We provide evidence that this lack of connectivity is driven by impaired communication from the posterior cingulate hub and does not simply represent hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that posterior cingulate degeneration is the driving force behind impaired DMN connectivity in aMCI. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={When there is a new patient, medical experts usually compare the results with those of previously seen cases for diagnosis and treatment. Besides, the number of digital medical images acquired, stored and managed at the healthcare centres is exponentially increasing each day with the advances in the medical imaging technology. Therefore, automated search and retrieval of similar casesfrom large medical databases may especially improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases whose causes and effects have not yet been fully known. Database management systems used at clinical sites store textual information like name, age, and gender along with medical images. Accordingly, combined usage of image features (content) with demographic and clinical information (context) for similar case search may improve accuracy andreliability of diagnosis, and thus result in increased patient care and lower healthcare costs. In this study we explored the effect of content features extracted from magnetic resonance images and context features such as patient demographics and clinical data on similarity-based disease diagnosis. Our validation on data composed of Alzheimer, Parkinson, Dementia and healty cases showed that combined usage of content and context provides more accurate diagnosis with less features. © 2014 IEEE.},

abstract={Developments in tasks and imaging techniques applied over the last decades have yielded substantial support for the hypothesized role of the hippocampus in mnemonic processes. Human imaging research has now moved on to disentangle the contributions of the different hippocampal subregions and adjacent cortices, so as to bridge the gap between rodent and human data. Besides the importance of such studies for basic research, the investigation of hippocampal (dys)function has clinical relevance for diseases ranging from neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy to mental disorders such as schizophrenia or anxiety disorders. So far, most of the present review articles and books about the hippocampus and its functions focus on traditional declarative memory paradigms and 'encoding versus retrieval'. In this chapter we concentrate on a less travelled, but not less important, route concerning the role of the hippocampus in a well-established associative learning (encoding) paradigm: pavlovian fear conditioning. Fear conditioning is hypothesized to model aversive associative learning on a nonpathological level and is further assumed to recruit the same networks that are relevant for anxiety disorders, with the hippocampus being specific for contextual fear conditioning. We highlight the findings in humans by addressing its role in mediating spatial and temporal aspects of a context, involving different kinds of a fear-conditioning procedure (delay vs. trace conditioning), and its role in extinction, both from a theoretical and clinical perspective. © 2014 S.

abstract={Content-Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) methods applieds to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are penetrating the universe of IT tools for clinical decision support. A clinician can take profit from retrieving subjects' scans with similar patterns. The CBVIR approach has been used since recently for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The most explored imaging modality in this context is the structural MRI. The Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively recent technique and CBVIR approaches have not yet been developed on it. The combination of several MRI modalities improves the performances of CBVIR methods, but first of all it is necessary to explore the ability of DTI modality to give a correct answer alone. The present work is amongst the earliest attempts to use visual features as in a generic CBVIR, on this modality for AD research. The proposed approach is based on the comparison of visual features extracted from the hippocampal area. We use the Circular Harmonic Functions (CHFs) to describe the content of the Diffusion Tensor-derived map: Mean Diffusivity (MD). This study was first accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and then with the DTI scans of a French epidemiological study: 'Bordeaux-3City'.

abstract={Indexing and classification tools for Content Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) have been penetrating the universe of medical image analysis. They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal “knowledge diffusion” process, when methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French epidemiological study: “Bordeaux dataset”. The experimental results show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 % and 85 % for ADNI subset and “Bordeaux dataset” respectively. For the most challenging group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach accuracies of 78.22 % and 72.23 % for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification results by 9 % in average for these three categories. Results demonstrate very promising classification performance and simplicity compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric AD diagnosis methods. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract={We hypothesized that semantic memory for object concepts involves both representations of visual feature knowledge in modality-specific association cortex and heteromodal regions that are important for integrating and organizing this semantic knowledge so that it can be used in a flexible, contextually appropriate manner. We examined this hypothesis in an fMRI study of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were presented with pairs of printed words and asked whether the words matched on a given visual-perceptual feature (e.g., guitar, violin: SHAPE). The stimuli probed natural kinds and manufactured objects, and the judgments involved shape or color. We found activation of bilateral ventral temporal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during semantic judgments, with AD patients showing less activation of these regions than healthy seniors. Moreover, AD patients showed less ventral temporal activation than did healthy seniors for manufactured objects, but not for natural kinds. We also used diffusion-weighted MRI of white matter to examine fractional anisotropy (FA). Patients with AD showed significantly reduced FA in the superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, which carry projections linking temporal and frontal regions of this semantic network. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that semantic memory is supported in part by a large-scale neural network involving modality-specific association cortex, heteromodal association cortex, and projections between these regions. The semantic deficit in AD thus arises from gray matter disease that affects the representation of feature knowledge and processing its content, as well as white matter disease that interrupts the integrated functioning of this large-scale network. © 2014 Psychonomic Society, Inc.},

abstract={Basic research on neurocognitive aging has traditionally adopted a reductionist approach in the search for the basis of cognitive preservation versus decline. However, increasing evidence suggests that a network level understanding of the brain can provide additional novel insight into the structural and functional organization from which complex behavior and dysfunction emerge. Using graph theory as a mathematical framework to characterize neural networks, recent data suggest that alterations in structural and functional networks may contribute to individual differences in cognitive phenotypes in advanced aging. This paper reviews literature that defines network changes in healthy and pathological aging phenotypes, while highlighting the substantial overlap in key features and patterns observed across aging phenotypes. Consistent with current efforts in this area, here we outline one analytic strategy that attempts to quantify graph theory metrics more precisely, with the goal of improving diagnostic sensitivity and predictive accuracy for differential trajectories in neurocognitive aging. Ultimately, such an approach may yield useful measures for gauging the efficacy of potential preventative interventions and disease modifying treatments early in the course of aging. © 2014.},

abstract={Background: Epidemiologic autopsy studies show mixed Alzheimer's disease (AD)/vascular pathology in many patients. Moreover, clinical research shows that it is not uncommon for AD and vascular dementia (VaD) patients to be equally impaired on memory, executive, or other neurocognitive tests. However, this clinical heterogeneity has not been incorporated into the new diagnostic criteria for AD (Dubois et al., 2010; McKhann et al., 2011). Objective: The current research applied Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to a protocol of six neuropsychological parameters to identify phenotypic subtypes from a large group of AD/VaD participants. Follow-up analyses examined difference between groups on neuroradiological parameters and neuropsychological measures of process and errors. Methods: 223 AD/VaD patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological protocol. Measures of whole brain and hippocampal volume were available for a portion of the sample (n = 76). Results: LCA identified four distinct groups: moderate/mixed dementia (n = 54; 24.21%), mild/mixed dementia (n = 91; 40.80%); dysexecutive (n = 49, 21.97%), and amnestic (n = 29, 13.00%). Follow-up analyses comparing the groups on neuropsychological process and error scores showed that the dysexecutive group exhibited difficulty sustaining mental set. The moderate/mixed group evidenced pronounced impairment on tests of lexical retrieval/naming along with significant amnesia. Amnestic patients also presented with gross amnesia, but showed relative sparing on other neuropsychological measures. Mild/mixed patients exhibited milder memory deficits that were intermediary between the amnestic and moderate/mixed groups. Conclusions: There are distinct neuropsychological profiles in patients independent of clinical diagnosis, suggesting that the two are not wholly separate and that this information should be integrated into new AD diagnostic paradigms. © 2014-IOS Press.},

abstract={The objective of this work was to assess the predictive accuracy of targeted neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures for the detection of incipient dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to examine the potential benefit of combining both classes of measures. Baseline MRI measures included hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and white matter hyperintensities. Neuropsychological assessment focused on different aspects of episodic memory (i.e., familiarity, free recall, and associative memory) and executive control functions (i.e., working memory, switching, and planning). Global and regional cortical thinning was observed in MCI patients who progressed to dementia compared to those who remained stable, whereas no differences were found between groups for baseline hippocampal volume and white matter hyperintensities. The strongest neuroimaging predictors were baseline cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate and middle frontal gyri. For cognitive predictors, we found that deficits in both free recall and recognition episodic memory tasks were highly suggestive of progression to dementia. Cortical thinning in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, combined to controlled and familiarity-based retrieval deficits, achieved a classification accuracy of 87.5%, a specificity of 90.9%, and a sensitivity of 83.3%. This predictive model including both classes of measures provided more accurate predictions than those based on neuroimaging or cognitive measures alone. Overall, our findings suggest that detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease is probably best accomplished by combining complementary information from targeted neuroimaging and cognitive classifiers, and highlight the importance of taking into account both structural and functional changes associated with the disease. © 2014-IOS Press.},

The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12% for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is seen to be the most significant for aMCI, while Accumbens area and ventricle are most significant for naMCI. © 1964-2012 IEEE.},

abstract={Combining multi-modality brain data for disease diagnosis commonly leads to improved performance. A challenge in using multi-modality data is that the data are commonly incomplete; namely, some modality might be missing for some subjects. In this work, we proposed a deep learning based framework for estimating multi-modality imaging data. Our method takes the form of convolutional neural networks, where the input and output are two volumetric modalities. The network contains a large number of trainable parameters that capture the relationship between input and output modalities. When trained on subjects with all modalities, the network can estimate the output modality given the input modality. We evaluated our method on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, where the input and output modalities are MRI and PET images, respectively. Results showed that our method significantly outperformed prior methods. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.},

abstract={Conflicting evidence exists regarding the integrity of episodic memory in the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Recent converging evidence suggests that episodic memory in progressive cases of bvFTD is compromised to the same extent as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying neural substrates of these episodic memory deficits, however, likely differ contingent on dementia type. In this study we sought to elucidate the neural substrates of episodic memory performance, across recall and recognition tasks, in both patient groups using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses. We predicted that episodic memory dysfunction would be apparent in both patient groups but would relate to divergent patterns of neural atrophy specific to each dementia type. We assessed episodic memory, across verbal and visual domains, in 19 bvFTD, 18 AD patients, and 19 age- and education-matched controls. Behaviorally, patient groups were indistinguishable for immediate and delayed recall, across verbal and visual domains. Whole-brain VBM analyses revealed regions commonly implicated in episodic retrieval across groups, namely the right temporal pole, right frontal lobe, left paracingulate gyrus, and right anterior hippocampus. Divergent neural networks specific to each group were also identified. Whereas a widespread network including posterior regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal and occipital cortices was exclusively implicated in AD, the frontal and anterior temporal lobes underpinned the episodic memory deficits in bvFTD. Our results point to distinct neural changes underlying episodic memory decline specific to each dementia syndrome. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Recently, brain connectivity networks have been used for classification of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from normal controls (NC). In typical connectivity-networks-based classification approaches, local measures of connectivity networks are first extracted from each region-of-interest as network features, which are then concatenated into a vector for subsequent feature selection and classification. However, some useful structural information of network, especially global topological information, may be lost in this type of approaches. To address this issue, in this article, we propose a connectivity-networks-based classification framework to identify accurately the MCI patients from NC. The core of the proposed method involves the use of a new graph-kernel-based approach to measure directly the topological similarity between connectivity networks. We evaluate our method on functional connectivity networks of 12 MCI and 25 NC subjects. The experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a classification accuracy of 91.9%, a sensitivity of 100.0%, a balanced accuracy of 94.0%, and an area under receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.94, demonstrating a great potential in MCI classification, based on connectivity networks. Further connectivity analysis indicates that the connectivity of the selected brain regions is different between MCI patients and NC, that is, MCI patients show reduced functional connectivity compared with NC, in line with the findings reported in the existing studies. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Background and purpose: The progression pattern of brain structural changes in patients with isolated cerebrovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. To investigate the role of isolated CVD in cognitive impairment patients, patterns of cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy in pure subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI) and pure subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) patients were characterized. Methods: Forty-five patients with svMCI and 46 patients with SVaD who were negative on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography imaging and 75 individuals with normal cognition (NC) were recruited. Results: Compared with NC, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited frontal, language and retrieval type memory dysfunctions, which in patients with PiB(-) SVaD were further impaired and accompanied by visuospatial and recognition memory dysfunctions. Compared with NC, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited cortical thinning in the frontal, perisylvian, basal temporal and posterior cingulate regions. This atrophy was more prominent and extended further toward the lateral parietal and medial temporal regions in patients with PiB(-) SVaD. Compared with NC subjects, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited hippocampal shape deformities in the lateral body, whilst patients with PiB(-) SVaD exhibited additional deformities within the lateral head and inferior body. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that patients with CVD in the absence of Alzheimer's disease pathology can be demented, showing cognitive impairment in multiple domains, which is consistent with the topography of cortical thinning and hippocampal shape deformity. © 2014 The Author(s) European Journal of Neurology © 2014 EFNS.},

abstract={The majority of brain activities are performed by functionally integrating separate regions of the brain. Therefore, the synchronous operation of the brain's multiple regions or neuronal assemblies can be represented as a network with nodes that are interconnected by links. Because of the complexity of brain interactions and their varying effects at different levels of complexity, one of the corresponding authors of this paper recently proposed the brainnetome as a new -ome to explore and integrate the brain network at different scales. Because electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are noninvasive and have outstanding temporal resolution and because they are the primary clinical techniques used to capture the dynamics of neuronal connections, they lend themselves to the analysis of the neural networks comprising the brainnetome. Because of EEG/MEG's applicability to brainnetome analyses, the aim of this review is to identify the procedures that can be used to form a network using EEG/MEG data in sensor or source space and to promote EEG/MEG network analysis for either neuroscience or clinical applications. To accomplish this aim, we show the relationship of the brainnetome to brain networks at the macroscale and provide a systematic review of network construction using EEG and MEG. Some potential applications of the EEG/MEG brainnetome are to use newly developed methods to associate the properties of a brainnetome with indices of cognition or disease conditions. Associations based on EEG/MEG brainnetome analysis may improve the comprehension of the functioning of the brain in neuroscience research or the recognition of abnormal patterns in neurological disease. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.},

abstract={Background While neuroimaging in ALS has gained unprecedented momentum in recent years, little progress has been made in the development of viable diagnostic, prognostic and monitoring markers. Objectives To identify and discuss the common pitfalls in ALS imaging studies and to reflect on optimal study designs based on pioneering studies. Methods A "PubMed"-based literature search on ALS was performed based on neuroimaging-related keywords. Study limitations were systematically reviewed and classified so that stereotypical trends could be identified. Results Common shortcomings, such as relatively small sample sizes, statistically underpowered study designs, lack of disease controls, poorly characterised patient cohorts and a large number of conflicting studies, remain a significant challenge to the field. Imaging data of ALS continue to be interpreted at a group-level, as opposed to meaningful individual-patient inferences. Conclusions A systematic, critical review of ALS imaging has identified stereotypical shortcomings, the lessons of which should be considered in the design of future prospective MRI studies. At a time when large multicentre studies are underway a candid discussion of these factors is particularly timely. © 2014 The Authors.},

abstract={Understanding neural network dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease is imperative to effectively develop network-modulating therapies. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), cognitive decline associates with deficits in resting-state functional connectivity of diffuse brain networks. The goal of the current study was to test whether specific cognitive impairments in AD spectrum correlate with reduced functional connectivity of distinct brain regions. We recorded resting-state functional connectivity of alpha-band activity in 27 patients with AD spectrum - 22 patients with probable AD (5 logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia, 7 posterior cortical atrophy, and 10 early-onset amnestic/dysexecutive AD) and 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to perform an unbiased search for regions where patterns of functional connectivity correlated with disease severity and cognitive performance. Functional connectivity measured the strength of coherence between a given region and the rest of the brain. Decreased neural connectivity of multiple brain regions including the right posterior perisylvian region and left middle frontal cortex correlated with a higher degree of disease severity. Deficits in executive control and episodic memory correlated with reduced functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex, whereas visuospatial impairments correlated with reduced functional connectivity of the left inferior parietal cortex. Our findings indicate that reductions in region-specific alpha-band resting-state functional connectivity are strongly correlated with, and might contribute to, specific cognitive deficits in AD spectrum. In the future, MEGI functional connectivity could be an important biomarker to map and follow defective networks in the early stages of AD. © 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) using fMRI has become an important tool in examining differences in brain activity between patient and healthy populations. Studies employing rs-fc have successfully identified altered intrinsic neural networks in many neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and more recently, tinnitus. The neural mechanisms of subjective tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound without an external source, are not well understood. Several inherent networks have been implicated in tinnitus; these include default mode, auditory, dorsal attention, and visual resting-state networks. Evidence from several studies has begun to suggest that tinnitus causes consistent modifications to these networks, including greater connectivity between limbic areas and cortical networks not traditionally involved with emotion processing, and increased connectivity between attention and auditory processing brain regions. Such consistent changes to these networks may allow for the identification of objective brain imaging measures of tinnitus, leading to a better understanding of the neural basis of the disorder. Further, examination of rs-fc allows us to correlate behavioral measures, such as tinnitus severity and comorbid factors including hearing loss, with specific intrinsic networks.This article is part of a Special Issue entitled <Human Auditory Neuroimaging>.© 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={The current theories on episodic memory suggest a crucial role of spatial processing for an effective retrieval. For a successful episodic recall, the long-term allocentric scene has to be translated into an egocentric scene. Here, we argue that a crucial role for an episodic retrieval is played by a "mental frame syncing" between two kinds of allocentric representations. This neurocognitive process allows an effective retrieval of our past experiences by synchronizing the allocentric view-point independent representation with the allocentric view-point dependent representation. If the "mental frame syncing" stops, even momentarily, it is difficult to reconstruct a coherent spatial scaffold upon which to effectively retrieve our previous events within an egocentric perspective. This is what apparently happens in Alzheimer's disease: a break in the "mental frame syncing" between these two kinds of allocentric representations, underpinned by damage to the hippocampus, may contribute significantly to the early deficit in episodic memory. © 2014 Serino and Riva.},

Fifty-four subjects (age: 72.02 ± 7.45; Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: 28.9 ± 1.24) presenting at a memory clinic complaining of memory deficit, but not demented, and thirty controls (age: 71.87 ± 7.08; MMSE score: 29.1 ± 1.1) were included. Subjects with memory complaints included both patients with (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI) and without (subjective memory complaints, SMC) impairment on memory tests. All subjects underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), analyzed with statistical parametric. Patients with aMCI but not those with SMC showed the expected posterior cingulate-precuneus and parietal hypometabolism as compared to controls. Correlation was determined for between four indexes of the RAVLT and brain metabolism. The results show a significant correlation between the delayed recall score and metabolism in posterior cingulate gyrus of both hemispheres and in left precuneus, as well as between a score of long-term percent retention and metabolism in left posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and orbitofrontal areas. These correlations survived correction for age, education, and MMSE score. No correlation was found between immediate or total recall scores and glucose metabolism. These data show the relevant role of posterior cingulate-precuneus and orbitofrontal cortices in retention and retrieval of de-contextualized verbal memory material in a group of elderly subjects with memory complaints and shed light on the topography of synaptic dysfunction in these subjects, overlapping that found in the earliest stages of Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration. © 2014-IOS Press and the authors.},

abstract={Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia reduces the brain cell growth and leads to brain death. Worldwide, nearly 35.6 million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or other dementias. Analyzing the electrical brain signal in its earlier stage would prevent the death rate. Due to its high complexity and non-stationary property, large amount of noise is present with signal. To recover this, several denoising methods are used. In our method, complex wavelet based denoising is preferred which provides information both in time and frequency domain. Of the different threshold selection methods, Shannon entropy based threshold selection has been used. By this method, higher SNR and lower RMSE values of about 18.25 and 0.5 are obtained. Features such as sample entropy, power spectral density and standard deviation are used to train the neural network for achieving the classification of AD from normal EEG. In this article, a specificity of about 90% is achieved. Copyright © 2014 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.},

The EEGs of 43 AD and MCI patients (aged between 62 and 88 years) were recorded, analyzed and correlated with their MMSE scores. Quantitative EEGs were calculated using discrete wavelet transform. The data obtained were analyzed by the means of the combined use of ANN and GA to determine the degree of cognitive impairment. The good recognition rate of ANN fed with these inputs suggests that the combined GA/ANN approach may be useful for early detection of AD and could be a valuable tool to support physicians in clinical practice.},

abstract={Functional brain imaging is a common tool in monitoring the progression of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Identifying functional brain imaging derived features that can accurately detect neurological disease is of primary importance to the medical community. Research in computer vision techniques to identify objects in photographs have reported high accuracies in that domain, but their direct applicability to identifying disease in functional imaging is still under investigation in the medical community. In particular, Serre et al. (: In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR-05). pp 994-1000) introduced a biophysically inspired filtering method emulating visual processing in striate cortex which they applied to perform object recognition in photographs. In this work, the model described by Serre et al. [2005] is extended to three-dimensional volumetric images to perform signal detection in functional brain imaging (PET, SPECT). The filter outputs are used to train both neural network and logistic regression classifiers and tested on two distinct datasets: ADNI Alzheimer's disease 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and National Football League players Tc99m HMPAO SPECT. The filtering pipeline is analyzed to identify which steps are most important for classification accuracy. Our results compare favorably with other published classification results and outperform those of a blinded expert human rater, suggesting the utility of this approach. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Purpose: [18F.fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging of the brain can be used to assist in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Group differences in glucose uptake between patients with dementia and controls are well-known. However, a multivariate analysis technique called scaled subprofile model, principal component analysis (SSM/PCA)   aiming at identifying diagnostic neural networks in diseases, have been applied less frequently. We validated an Alzheimer’s Disease-related (AD) glucose metabolic brain pattern using the SSM/PCA analysis and applied it prospectively in an independent confirmation cohort. Methods: We used FDG-PET scans of 18 healthy controls and 15 AD patients (identification cohort) to identify an AD-related glucose metabolic covariance pattern. In the confirmation cohort (n=15), we investigated the ability to discriminate between probable AD and non-probable AD (possible AD, mild cognitive impairment  (MCI) or subjective complaints). Results: The AD-related metabolic covariance pattern was characterized by relatively decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal regions and relatively increased metabolism in the subcortical white matter, cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed at a cut-off value of z=1.23, a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 94% for correct AD classification. In the confirmation cohort, subjects with clinically probable AD diagnosis showed a high expression of the AD-related pattern whereas in subjects with a non-probable AD diagnosis a low expression was found. Conclusion: The  lzheimer’s disease-related cerebral glucose metabolic covariance pattern identified by SSM/PCA analysis was highly sensitive and specific for Alzheimer’s disease. This method is expected to be helpful in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease in clinical practice. © 2014 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2) cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric disease. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={The human brain consists of many different neural elements that comprise a functioning processing and control system. Though each area has its unique role, they do not operate separately. It is empirically known that during brain activity, different elements affect each other. Such neural network's activity is called Functional Brain Connectivity (FBC). It is a known phenomenon among athletes who suffer mild head injuries frequently along their career, to be more likely to suffer from neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's at old age. This phenomenon has been studied by physicians and health researchers as early as 1971 [1]. Patients who suffered from frequent mild head injuries have no neurological appearable symptoms at young age. FBC abnormality accompanies the mentioned neurological diseases, each characterizes with a different pattern [2], [3]. These two facts led the hypothesis that frequent head injuries can, with some probability, cause FBC abnormalities. Proving this hypothesis and mapping the transformed pattern of FBC can contribute to understanding neurological diseases and by this help the search after treatment generally and preventing for frequent mild injured athletes particularly. This work offers a technology that enables brain researchers to evaluate and locate abnormalities in FBC using fMRI data of a patient. It does so using the fact that connectivity pattern, at rest state, is to a large extent symmetrical. The system evaluates connectivity between classes of voxels using a new nonlinear-Differential Filtered Coherence. It is a mathematical solution for describing connections that are not necessary linear by following the influences of changes in one signal on the changes in another. Finally, the system finds FBC asymmetry using registration of the generated connectivity map between the two hemispheres of the brain. © Copyright 2015 IEEE All rights reserved.},

abstract={Since the Brain Order Disorder (BOD) group reported on a high density Electroencephalogram (EEG) to capture the neuronal information using EEG to wirelessly interface with a Smartphone [1,2], a larger BOD group has been assembled, including the Obama BRAIN program, CUA Brain Computer Interface Lab and the UCSD Swartz Computational Neuroscience Center. We can implement the pair-electrodes correlation functions in order to operate in a real time daily environment, which is of the computation complexity of O(N3) for N=102~3 known as functional f-EEG. The daily monitoring requires two areas of focus. Area #(1) to quantify the neuronal information flow under arbitrary daily stimuli-response sources. Approach to #1: (i) We have asserted that the sources contained in the EEG signals may be discovered by an unsupervised learning neural network called blind sources separation (BSS) of independent entropy components, based on the irreversible Boltzmann cellular thermodynamics(δS &lt; 0), where the entropy is a degree of uniformity. What is the entropy? Loosely speaking, sand on the beach is more uniform at a higher entropy value than the rocks composing a mountain - the internal binding energy tells the paleontologists the existence of information. To a politician, landside voting results has only the winning information but more entropy, while a non-uniform voting distribution record has more information. For the human's effortless brain at constant temperature, we can solve the minimum of Helmholtz free energy (H = E TS) by computing BSS, and then their pairwise-entropy source correlation function. (i) Although the entropy itself is not the information per se, but the concurrence of the entropy sources is the information flow as a functional-EEG, sketched in this 2nd BOD report. Area #(2) applying EEG bio-feedback will improve collective decision making (TBD). Approach to #2: We introduce a novel performance quality metrics, in terms of the throughput rate of faster (δt) &amp; more accurate (δA) decision making, which applies to individual, as well as team brain dynamics. Following Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahnmen's novel "Thinking fast and slowa", through the brainwave biofeedback we can first identify an individual's "anchored cognitive bias sources". This is done in order to remove the biases by means of individually tailored pre-processing. Then the training effectiveness can be maximized by the collective product δt* δA. For Area #1, we compute a spatiotemporally windowed EEG in vitro average using adaptive time-window sampling. The sampling rate depends on the type of neuronal responses, which is what we seek. The averaged traditional EEG measurements and are further improved by BSS decomposition into finer stimulus-response source mixing matrix [A] having finer &amp; faster spatial grids with rapid temporal updates. Then, the functional EEG is the second order co-variance matrix defined as the electrode-pair fluctuation correlation function C(s̃, s̃′) of independent thermodynamic source components. (1) We define a 1-D Space filling curve as a spiral curve without origin. This pattern is historically known as the Peano-Hilbert arc length a. By taking the most significant bits of the Cartesian product a ≡ O(x* y* z), it represents the arc length in the numerical size with values that map the 3-D neighborhood proximity into a 1-D neighborhood arc length representation. (2) 1-D Fourier coefficients spectrum have no spurious high frequency contents, which typically arise in lexicographical (zig-zag scanning) discontinuity [Hsu &amp; Szu, a"Peano-Hilbert curve," SPIE 2014]. A simple Fourier spectrum histogram fits nicely with the Compressive Sensing CRDT Mathematics. (3) Stationary power spectral density is a reasonable approximation of EEG responses in striate layers in resonance feedback loops capable of producing a 100, 000 neuronal collective Impulse Response Function (IRF). The striate brain layer architecture represents an ensemble &lt;IRF&lt; e.g. at V1-V4 of Brodmann areas 17-19 of the Cortex, i.e. stationary Wiener-Kintchine-Einstein Theorem. Goal#1: functional-EEG: After taking the 1-D space-filling curve, we compute the ensemble averaged 1-D Power Spectral Density (PSD) and then make use of the inverse FFT to generate f-EEG. (ii) Goal#2 individual wellness baseline (IWB): We need novel change detection, so we derive the ubiquitous fat-tail distributions for healthy brains PSD in outdoor environments (Signal=310°C; Noise=27°C: SNR=310/300; 300°K=(1/40)eV). The departure from IWB might imply stress, fever, a sports injury, an unexpected fall, or numerous midnight excursions which may signal an onset of dementia in Home Alone Senior (HAS), discovered by telemedicine care-giver networks. Aging global villagers need mental healthcare devices that are affordable, harmless, administrable (AHA) and user-friendly, situated in a clothing article such as a baseball hat and able to interface with pervasive Smartphones in daily environment. ©2014 SPIE.},

abstract={Accurate classification of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients. Among many research tasks, it is of particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight co-adaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor and a multi-task learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI data set and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the classification accuracies by 6.2% on average as compared to classical deep learning methods. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.},

abstract={Clinical trials of the PET amyloid imaging agent 18F-flutemetamol have used visual assessment to classify PET scans as negative or positive for brain amyloid. However, quantification provides additional information about regional and global tracer uptake and may have utility for image assessment over time and across different centers. Using postmortem brain neuritic plaque density data as a truth standard to derive a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) threshold, we assessed a fully automated quantification method comparing visual and quantitative scan categorizations. We also compared the histopathology-derived SUVR threshold with one derived from healthy controls.
Methods: Data from 345 consenting subjects enrolled in 8 prior clinical trials of 18F-flutemetamol injection were used. We grouped subjects into 3 cohorts: an autopsy cohort (n = 68) comprising terminally ill patients with postmortem confirmation of brain amyloid status; a test cohort (n = 172) comprising 33 patients with clinically probable Alzheimer disease, 80 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 59 healthy volunteers; and a healthy cohort of 105 volunteers, used to define a reference range for SUVR. Visual image categorizations for comparison were from a previous study. A fully automated PET-only quantification method was used to compute regional neocortical SUVRs that were combined into a single composite SUVR. An SUVR threshold for classifying scans as positive or negative was derived by ranking the PET scans from the autopsy cohort based on their composite SUVR and comparing data with the standard of truth based on postmortem brain amyloid status for subjects in the autopsy cohort. The derived threshold was used to categorize the 172 scans in the test cohort as negative or positive, and results were compared with categorization using visual assessment. Different reference and composite region definitions were assessed. Threshold levels were also compared with corresponding thresholds derived from the healthy group.
Results: Automated quantification (using pons as the reference region) demonstrated 91% sensitivity and 88% specificity and gave 3 false-positive and 4 false-negative scans. All 3 false-positive cases were either borderline-normal by standard of truth or had moderate to heavy cortical diffuse plaque burden. In the test cohort, the concordance between quantitative and visual read categorization ranged from 97.1% to 99.4% depending on the selection of reference and composite regions. The threshold derived from the healthy group was close to the histopathology-derived threshold.
Conclusion: Categorization of 18F-flutemetamol amyloid imaging data using an automated PET-only quantification method showed good agreement with histopathologic classification of neuritic plaque density and a strong concordance with visual read results.

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal subjects from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using a proposed 'sequential Projection Based Learning for Meta-cognitive q-Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McqRBFN)' classifier. The McqRBFN has two components, namely, a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is a single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with a q-Gaussian activation function, that allows different RBF's in one network, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy functions, by changing a real q-parameter. The meta-cognitive component present in McqRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McqRBFN employs a sequential Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) is used for feature extraction from MRI data and extracted VBM features are fed into the PBL-McqRBFN classifier. The experimental results show that our proposed PBL-McqRBFN classifier can accurately differentiate MCI and normal subjects. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Rare autosomal dominant mutations result in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD) with a relatively consistent age of onset within families. This provides an estimate of years until disease onset (relative age) in mutation carriers. Increased AD risk has been associated with differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during memory tasks, but most of these studies have focused on possession of apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4), a risk factor, but not causative variant, of late-onset AD. Evaluation of fMRI activity in presymptomatic FAD mutation carriers versus noncarriers provides insight into preclinical changes in those who will certainly develop AD in a prescribed period of time. Adults from FAD mutation-carrying families (nine mutation carriers, eight noncarriers) underwent fMRI scanning while performing a memory task. We examined fMRI signal differences between carriers and noncarriers, and how signal related to fMRI task performance within mutation status group, controlling for relative age and education. Mutation noncarriers had greater retrieval period activity than carriers in several AD-relevant regions, including the left hippocampus. Better performing noncarriers showed greater encoding period activity including in the parahippocampal gyrus. Poorer performing carriers showed greater retrieval period signal, including in the frontal and temporal lobes, suggesting underlying pathological processes. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

abstract={Computational anatomy with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well established as a noninvasive biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD); however, there is less certainty about its dependency on the staging of AD. We use classical group analyses and automated machine learning classification of standard structural MRI scans to investigate AD diagnostic accuracy from the preclinical phase to clinical dementia. Longitudinal data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were stratified into 4 groups according to the clinical status-(1) AD patients; (2) mild cognitive impairment (MCI) converters; (3) MCI nonconverters; and (4) healthy controls-and submitted to a support vector machine. The obtained classifier was significantly above the chance level (62%) for detecting AD already 4 years before conversion from MCI. Voxel-based univariate tests confirmed the plausibility of our findings detecting a distributed network of hippocampal-temporoparietal atrophy in AD patients. We also identified a subgroup of control subjects with brain structure and cognitive changes highly similar to those observed in AD. Our results indicate that computational anatomy can detect AD substantially earlier than suggested by current models. The demonstrated differential spatial pattern of atrophy between correctly and incorrectly classified AD patients challenges the assumption of a uniform pathophysiological process underlying clinically identified AD. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Automated labeling of anatomical structures in medical images is very important in many neuroscience studies. Recently, patch-based labeling in the non-local manner has been widely investigated to alleviate the possible misalignment when registering atlases to the target image. However, the weights used for label fusion from the registered atlases in conventional methods are generally computed independently and thus lack the capability of preventing the ambiguous atlas patches from contributing to the label fusion. More critically, these weights are often calculated based only on the simple patch similarity, thus not necessarily providing optimal solution for label fusion. To address these issues, we present a novel patch-based label fusion method in multi-atlas scenario, for the goal of labeling each voxel in the target image by the best representative atlas patches that also have the lowest joint risk of mislabeling. Specifically, sparse coding is used to select a small number of atlas patches which best represent the underlying patch at each point of the target image, thus minimizing the chance of including the misleading atlas patches for labeling. Furthermore, we examine the joint risk of any pair of atlas patches in making similar labeling error, by analyzing the correlation of their morphological error patterns and also the labeling consensus among atlases. This joint risk will be further recursively updated based on the latest labeling results to correct the possible labeling errors. To demonstrate the performance of our proposed method, we have evaluated it on both whole brain parcellation and hippocampus segmentation, and achieved promising labeling results, compared with the state-of-the-art methods.},

Working memory and long-term declarative memory are affected early during the course of the disease. The individual pattern of impaired memory functions correlates with parameters of structural or functional brain integrity. AD pathology interferes with the formation of memories from the molecular level to the framework of neural networks. The investigation of AD memory loss helps to identify the involved neural structures, such as the default mode network, the influence of epigenetic and genetic factors, such as ApoE4 status, and evolutionary aspects of human cognition. Clinically, the analysis of memory assists the definition of AD subtypes, disease grading, and prognostic predictions. Despite new AD criteria that allow the earlier diagnosis of the disease by inclusion of biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid or hippocampal volume analysis, neuropsychological testing remains at the core of AD diagnosis. © 2013 AICH-Servier Research Group.},

abstract={Language capacities in dementia are increasingly studied. Major advances in cognitive neuro psychology and functional neuroanatomy have shown extensive language networks in frontal, parietal and temporal cortex and their subcortical connections mainly, but not exclusively, in the left hemisphere. The main aphasias following strokes or brain tumours that correspond to the classic Wernicke-Lichtheim connectionism model are, therefore, rarely encountered. Moreover, degenerative pathology is never restricted to a focal location and often associates both motor and semantic aspects of speech and language. Primary progressive aphasias including agrammatic/non-fluent, logopenic and semantic variants served as models of relatively pure language deficits and helped our understanding of other dementias. Agrammatic/nonfluent aphasia and/or speech apraxia constitute clinical criteria for corticobasal degeneration and supranuclear palsy, and can occur in isolation before corticobasal or supranuclear syndromes emerge. In the classic form of Alzheimer's disease, word-retrieval anomia is frequent, as a result of lexico-semantic difficulties. Alterations in pragmatics are increasingly recognised. Verbal fluencies constitute the main language difficulties in sub cortical vascular dementia, which is still poorly studied. In the continuum Parkinson's disease / Parkinson's disease with dementia / dementia with Lewy bodies, executive and working memory deficits at least partly explain discourse organisation difficulties and impaired sentence processing. Patients with the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia show verbal communication deficits secondary to pragmatic difficulties. In the near future, better phenotype-genotype correlations made using modern cognitive neuropsychological models and computerised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), functional MRI and in-vivo molecular neuro imaging will improve our diagnostic accuracy of the main dementias, help better to follow up patients and benefit communication of caregivers with patients.},

abstract={Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is typically described as a neurologic disorder affecting a cerebral network comprising the hippocampus proper and several anatomically related extrahippocampal regions. A new level of complexity was recently added to the study of this disorder by the evidence that TLE also appears to chronically alter the activity of several brain-wide neural networks involved in the control of higher order brain functions and not traditionally linked to epilepsy. Recently developed brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) analysis of resting state connectivity, have greatly contributed to these observations by allowing the precise characterization of several brain networks with distinct functional signatures in the resting brain, and therefore also known as "resting state networks." These significant advances in imaging represent an opportunity to investigate the still elusive origins of the disabling cognitive and psychiatric manifestations of TLE, and could have important implications for its pathophysiology and, perhaps, its therapy. Herein we review recent studies in this field by focusing on resting state networks that have been implicated in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders and cognitive impairment in patients with epilepsy: the default mode network, the attention network, and the reward/emotion network.© 2013 International League Against Epilepsy.},

For this purpose, two different methodologies and variations were used. The Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT) was applied to one of the methodologies and the Wavelet Transform (WT) was applied to the other methodology. The studied features of the EEG signals were the Relative Power in conventional EEG bands and their associated Spectral Ratios (r1, r2, r3, and r4).

abstract={Introduction of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 1980 and its advancement in the last three decades offered the possibility to visualize and quantify changes in white matter. DTI allows the evaluation of the structural integrity in complex neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progressive disintegration of functional and structural neural network coordination contributes to the cognitive dysfunction in AD. Therefore, detection of loss of cortico-cortical projections may support an early diagnosis at prodromal stages of disease which may prove essential for future preventive AD treatment trials. Moreover, structural integrity measured by DTI may help to distinguish between symptomatic and disease modifying effects of pharmacological interventions. This review gives a concise account on the physical basis of DTI acquisition and processing. We summarize DTI findings in normal aging and AD and regarding the effects of cognitive intervention and antidementive treatment on structural neural connectivity. Finally, we evaluate the promising future potential of DTI to become a surrogate endpoint in clinical AD trials. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, complex and chronically progressive brain disease. Its course is non-linear, dynamic, adaptive to maladaptive, and compensatory to decompensatory, affecting large-scale neural networks through a plethora of mechanistic and signaling pathway alterations that converge into regional and cell type-specific neurodegeneration and, finally, into clinically overt cognitive and behavioral decline. This decline includes reductions in the activities of daily living, quality of life, independence, and life expectancy. Evolving lines of research suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play a crucial role during AD development and progression. Epigenetics designates molecular mechanisms that alter gene expression without modifications of the genetic code. This topic includes modifications on DNA and histone proteins, the primary elements of chromatin structure. Accumulating evidence has revealed the relevant processes that mediate epigenetic modifications and has begun to elucidate how these processes are apparently dysregulated in AD. This evidence has led to the clarification of the roles of specific classes of therapeutic compounds that affect epigenetic pathways and characteristics of the epigenome. This insight is accompanied by the development of new methods for studying the global patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin alterations. In particular, high-throughput sequencing approaches, such as next-generation DNA sequencing techniques, are beginning to drive the field into the next stage of development. In parallel, genetic imaging is beginning to answer additional questions through its ability to uncover genetic variants, with or without genome-wide significance, that are related to brain structure, function and metabolism, which impact disease risk and fundamental network-based cognitive processes. Neuroimaging measures can further be used to define AD systems and endophenotypes. The integration of genetic neuroimaging methods with epigenetic markers in humans appears promising. This evolving development may lead to a new research discipline - imaging epigenetics - that will provide deeper insight into the causative pathogenetic and pathophysiological pathways through which genes and environment interrelate during life and impact human brain development, physiology, aging and disease. This knowledge may open doors for the development of novel biomarkers and preventive and disease-modifying treatments. © 2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

abstract={Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurological disease which is often comorbid with early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study explores the potential for detecting changes in neurological functional organization which may be indicative of MCI and early AD using neural network models for scalp EEG signal reconstruction. Resting 32-channel EEG records from 48 age-matched participants (mean age 75.7 years) - 15 normal controls (NC), 16 MCI, and 17 early-stage AD - are examined. Neural network models are trained to reconstruct artificially 'deleted' samples of EEG using subsets of records from NC participants. Models are applied to EEG records and quality scores are assigned to reconstructions of individual channels. Principal components of regional average reconstruction quality scores are used in a support vector machine model to discriminate between groups. Analyses demonstrate accuracies of 90.3% for MCI vs. NC (p-value<0.0005), 90.6% for AD vs. NC (p-value<0.0003), and 87.5% for AD/MCI vs. NC (p-value<0.0003). Techniques developed here may be used to detect changes in EEG activity due to neurological degeneration associated with MCI and early AD. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterised by impaired sentence repetition and word retrieval difficulties. Post mortem studies, amyloid imaging and CSF tau/Aβ measurements suggest Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology as the underlying cause. Relatively little is known about patterns of progression in patients with the logopenic variant of PPA. 21 patients (3 with post mortem confirmation of AD and 5 with positive amyloid PIB-PET scans) were studied with longitudinal T1-weighted MR imaging (mean interscan interval 1.2. years) using volumetric analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Baseline imaging showed asymmetrical (left greater than right) involvement of the posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal lobes as well as posterior cingulate and medial temporal lobes. The whole brain rate of volume loss was 2.0% per year with a greater rate of left hemisphere atrophy (2.3%/year) than right hemisphere (1.6%/year). Longitudinal VBM analysis showed increasing involvement of other areas in the left hemisphere (temporal, parietal, frontal and caudate) and atrophy of areas in the right hemisphere that had been involved earlier in the disease in the left hemisphere, particularly posterior cingulate/precuneus. With disease progression there was worsening of anomia, sentence repetition and sentence comprehension but consistent with the spread of imaging changes also deficits in single word comprehension, single word repetition and verbal memory. This study shows that the logopenic variant of PPA remains an asymmetrical disease, with spread through the left hemisphere language network but also involvement to a lesser degree of regions in the right hemisphere that mirror the earlier left hemisphere changes. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

In this study, we constructed brain networks using resting-state functional MRI data that was extracted from four populations mal controls, patients with early mild cognitive impairment, patients with late mild cognitive impairment, and patients with Alzheimer's disease) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative data set. The aim was to analyze the characteristics of resting-state functional neural networks, and to observe mild cognitive impairment at different stages before the transformation to Alzheimer's disease. Results showed that as cognitive deficits increased across the four groups, the shortest path in the resting- state functional network gradually increased, while clustering coefficients gradually decreased. This evidence indicates that dementia is associated with a decline of brain network efficiency. In tion, the changes in functional networks revealed the progressive deterioration of network function across brain regions from healthy elderly adults to those with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The alterations of node attributes in brain regions may reflect the cognitive functions in brain regions, and we speculate that early impairments in memory, hearing, and language function can eventually lead to diffuse brain injury and other cognitive impairments.},

We believe that there exist latent complicated patterns, e.g., non-linear relations, inherent in the low-level features. Combining latent information with the original low-level features helps build a robust model for AD/MCI classification with high diagnostic accuracy.

abstract={Motivation: Multivariate quantitative traits arise naturally in recent neuroimaging genetics studies, in which both structural and functional variability of the human brain is measured non-invasively through techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is growing interest in detecting genetic variants associated with such multivariate traits, especially in genome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs) classifiers, which are ensembles of decision trees, are amongst the best performing machine learning algorithms and have been successfully employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in case-control studies. RFs can also be applied to produce gene rankings in association studies with multivariate quantitative traits, and to estimate genetic similarities measures that are predictive of the trait. However, in studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs and high-dimensional traits, a very large ensemble of trees must be inferred from the data in order to obtain reliable rankings, which makes the application of these algorithms computationally prohibitive.Results: We have developed a parallel version of the RF algorithm for regression and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale population genetic association studies involving multivariate traits, called PaRFR (Parallel Random Forest Regression). Our implementation takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model and is deployed on Hadoop, an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Notable speed-ups are obtained by introducing a distance-based criterion for node splitting in the tree estimation process. PaRFR has been applied to a genome-wide association study on Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which the quantitative trait consists of a high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotype describing longitudinal changes in the human brain structure. PaRFR provides a ranking of SNPs associated to this trait, and produces pair-wise measures of genetic proximity that can be directly compared to pair-wise measures of phenotypic proximity. Several known AD-related variants have been identified, including APOE4 and TOMM40. We also present experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the number of top-ranked mutated states, or frequent mutation patterns, and an indicator of disease severity.Availability: The Java codes are freely available at http://www2.imperial.ac.uk/~gmontana. © 2013 Wang et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract={The human brain can be studied as a hierarchy of complex networks on different temporal and spatial scales. On each scale, from gene, protein, synapse, neuron and microcircuit, to area, pathway and the whole brain, many advances have been made with the development of related techniques. Brain network studies on different temporal and spatial scales are booming. However, such studies have focused on single levels, and can only reflect limited aspects of how the brain is formed and how it works. Therefore, it is increasingly urgent to integrate a variety of techniques, methods and models, and to merge fragmented findings into a uniform research framework or platform. To this end, we have proposed the concept of the brainnetome and several related programs/projects have been launched in China. In this paper, we offer a brief review on the methodologies of the brainnetome, which include techniques on different scales, the brainnetome atlas, and methods of brain network analysis. We then take Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia as examples to show how the brainnetome can be studied in neurological and psychiatric disorders. We also review the studies of how risk genes for brain diseases affect the brain networks. Finally, we summarize the challenges for the brainnetome, and what actions and measures have been taken to address these challenges in China. It is envisioned that the brainnetome will open new avenues and some long-standing issues may be solved by combining the brainnetome with other "omes". © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) has been used extensively to characterize motor system pathophysiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and other forms of dementia, as well to monitor the effects of certain pharmacological agents. Among the studies focusing on motor cortical excitability measures, the most consistent finding is a significant reduction of short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) in AD and other forms of dementia in which the cholinergic system is affected, such as dementia with Lewy bodies. SAI evaluation may thus provide a reliable biomarker of cortical cholinergic dysfunction in dementias. Moreover, most TMS studies have demonstrated cortical hyperexcitability and asymptomatic motor cortex functional reorganization in the early stages of the disease. Integrated approaches utilizing TMS together with high-density EEG have indicated impaired cortical plasticity and functional connectivity across different neural networks in AD. Paired associative stimulation-induced plasticity has also been found to be abnormal in patients with AD. The development of novel noninvasive methods of brain stimulation, in particular repetitive TMS (rTMS) and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), has increased the interest in neuromodulatory techniques as potential therapeutic tools for cognitive rehabilitation in AD. Preliminary studies have revealed that rTMS and tDCS can induce beneficial effects on specific cognitive functions in AD. Future studies are warranted to replicate and extend the initial findings. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={We aimed to develop a new method to convert T1-weighted brain MRIs to feature vectors, which could be used for content-based image retrieval (CBIR). To overcome the wide range of anatomical variability in clinical cases and the inconsistency of imaging protocols, we introduced the Gross feature recognition of Anatomical Images based on Atlas grid (GAIA), in which the local intensity alteration, caused by pathological (e.g., ischemia) or physiological (development and aging) intensity changes, as well as by atlas-image misregistration, is used to capture the anatomical features of target images. As a proof-of-concept, the GAIA was applied for pattern recognition of the neuroanatomical features of multiple stages of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and four subtypes of primary progressive aphasia. For each of these diseases, feature vectors based on a training dataset were applied to a test dataset to evaluate the accuracy of pattern recognition. The feature vectors extracted from the training dataset agreed well with the known pathological hallmarks of the selected neurodegenerative diseases. Overall, discriminant scores of the test images accurately categorized these test images to the correct disease categories. Images without typical disease-related anatomical features were misclassified. The proposed method is a promising method for image feature extraction based on disease-related anatomical features, which should enable users to submit a patient image and search past clinical cases with similar anatomical phenotypes. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Autobiographical memory is commonly impaired in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, little is known about the very recent past which is though highly important in daily life adaptation. In addition, the impact of sleep disturbances, also frequently reported in AD, on the consolidation, and retrieval of autobiographical memories remains to be assessed. Using an adaptation of the TEMPau task, we investigated the neural substrates of autobiographical memory for recent events and the potential relationship with sleep in 14 patients with mild AD. On day 1, autobiographical memory was explored across three periods: remote (18-30 years), the last 2 years and the last month. After testing, sleep was recorded using polysomnography.The next day, AD patients benefited a resting-state 18FDG-PET scan and a second exploration of autobiographical memory, focusing on the very recent past (today and yesterday). Total recall and episodic recall scores were obtained. In addition, for all events recalled, Remember responses justified by specific factual, spatial, and temporal details were measured using the Remember/Know paradigm. Retrieval of autobiographical memories was impaired in AD, but recall of young adulthood and very recent events was relatively better compared to the two intermediate periods. Recall of recent events (experienced the day and the day preceding the assessment) was correlated with brain glucose consumption in the precuneus and retrosplenial cortex, the calcarine region, the angular gyrus, and lateral temporal areas. AD patients also provided more Justified Remember responses for events experienced the previous-day than for those experienced the day of the assessment. Moreover, Justified Remember responses obtained for events experienced before sleep were positively correlated with the amount of slow-wave sleep.These data provide the first evidence of an association between the ability to retrieve recent autobiographical memories and sleep in mild AD patients. © 2013 Rauchs, Piolino, Bertran, de La Sayette, Viader, Eustache and Desgranges.},

abstract={The expression of clinically useful proteins in plants has been bolstered by the development of high-yielding systems for transient protein expression using agroinfiltration. There is a need now to know more about how host plant development and metabolism influence the quantity and quality of recombinant proteins. Endogenous proteolysis is a key determinant of the stability and yield of recombinant proteins in plants. Here we characterised cysteine (C1A) and aspartate (A1) protease profiles in leaves of the widely used expression host Nicotiana benthamiana, in relation with the production of a murine IgG, C5-1, targeted to the cell secretory pathway. Agroinfiltration significantly altered the distribution of C1A and A1 proteases along the leaf age gradient, with a correlation between leaf age and the level of proteolysis in whole-cell and apoplast protein extracts. The co-expression of tomato cystatin SlCYS8, an inhibitor of C1A proteases, alongside C5-1 increased antibody yield by nearly 40% after the usual 6-days incubation period, up to ∼3 mg per plant. No positive effect of SlCYS8 was observed in oldest leaves, in line with an increased level of C1A protease activity and a very low expression rate of the inhibitor. By contrast, C5-1 yield was greater by an additional 40% following 8- to 10-days incubations in younger leaves, where high SlCYS8 expression was maintained. These findings confirm that the co-expression of recombinant protease inhibitors is a promising strategy for increasing recombinant protein yields in plants, but that further opportunity exists to improve this approach by addressing the influence of leaf age and proteases of other classes. © 2013 Robert et al.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel method for detecting the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is presented. It uses a combination of three different machine learning algorithms in order to get improved results and is based on a three-class classification problem. The three classes for classification considered in this study are normal, very mild AD and mild and moderate AD subjects. The machine learning algorithms used are: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification, with its performance optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Genetic algorithm (GA) used for feature selection. A Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used for feature extraction from the MRI images and GA is used to reduce the high dimensional features needed for classification. The GA-ELM-PSO classifier yields an average training accuracy of 94.57 % and a testing accuracy of 87.23 %, averaged across the three classes, over ten random trials. The results clearly indicate that the proposed approach can differentiate between very mild AD and normal cases more accurately, indicating its usefulness in detecting the onset of AD. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Nanomedicine is defined as the area using nanotechnology's concepts for the benefit of human beings' health and well being. In this article, we aimed to provide an overview of areas where nanotechnology is applied and how they could be extended to care for psychiatric illnesses. The main applications of nanotechnology in psychiatry are (i) pharmacology. There are two main difficulties in neuropharmacology: drugs have to pass the blood-brain barrier and then to be internalized by targeted cells. Nanoparticles could increase drugs bioavailability and pharmacokinetics, especially improving safety and efficacy of psychotropic drugs. Liposomes, nanosomes, nanoparticle polymers, nanobubbles are some examples of this targeted drug delivery. Nanotechnologies could also add new pharmacological properties, like nanoshells and dendrimers (ii) living analysis. Nanotechnology provides technical assistance to in vivo imaging or metabolome analysis (iii) central nervous system modeling. Research teams have succeeded to modelize inorganic synapses and mimick synaptic behavior, a step essential for further creation of artificial neural systems. Some nanoparticle assemblies present the same small worlds and free-scale networks architecture as cortical neural networks. Nanotechnologies and quantum physics could be used to create models of artificial intelligence and mental illnesses. We are not about to see a concrete application of nanomedicine in daily psychiatric practice. Even if nanotechnologies are promising, their safety is still inconsistent and this must be kept in mind. However, it seems essential that psychiatrists do not forsake this area of research the perspectives of which could be decisive in the field of mental illness. © 2012 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.},

Such wearable tools pave the way to personalized medicine, for example giving the opportunity to control the progression of the disease and the effect of drugs. By applying Compressive Sensing (CS) techniques it is in principle possible to overcome the difficulty raised by smartphones spatial-temporal throughput rate bottleneck. Unfortunately, EEG and other physiological signals are often non-sparse. In this paper, it is instead shown that the EEG of AD patients becomes actually more compressible with the progression of the disease. EEG of Mild Cognitive Impaired (MCI) subjects is also showing clear tendency to enhanced compressibility.

Information related to neural networks has elucidated the nonlinear dynamical complexity in brain signals over a range of temporal scales. The recent advent of nonlinear analytic methods, which have served for the quantitative description of the brain signal complexity, has provided new insights into aberrant neural connectivity in many mental disorders. Although many studies have underpinned aberrant neural connectivity, findings related to complexity behavior are still inconsistent. This inconsistency might result from (i) heterogeneity in mental disorders, (ii) analytical issues, (iii) interference of typical development and aging. First, most mental disorders are heterogeneous in their clinical feature or intrinsic pathological mechanisms. Second, neurophysiologic output signals from complex brain connectivity might be characterized with multiple time scales or frequencies. Finally, age-related brain complexity changes must be considered when investigating pathological brain because typical brain complexity is not constant across generations. Future systematic studies addressing these issues will greatly expand our knowledge of neural connections and dynamics related to mental disorders. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Anatomical segmentation of structures of interest is critical to quantitative analysis in medical imaging. Several automated multi-atlas based segmentation propagation methods that utilise manual delineations from multiple templates appear promising. However, high levels of accuracy and reliability are needed for use in diagnosis or in clinical trials. We propose a new local ranking strategy for template selection based on the locally normalised cross correlation (LNCC) and an extension to the classical STAPLE algorithm by Warfield et al. (2004), which we refer to as STEPS for Similarity and Truth Estimation for Propagated Segmentations. It addresses the well-known problems of local vs. global image matching and the bias introduced in the performance estimation due to structure size. We assessed the method on hippocampal segmentation using a leave-one-out cross validation with optimised model parameters; STEPS achieved a mean Dice score of 0.925 when compared with manual segmentation. This was significantly better in terms of segmentation accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art fusion techniques. Furthermore, due to the finer anatomical scale, STEPS also obtains more accurate segmentations even when using only a third of the templates, reducing the dependence on large template databases. Using a subset of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) scans from different MRI imaging systems and protocols, STEPS yielded similarly accurate segmentations (Dice=0.903). A cross-sectional and longitudinal hippocampal volumetric study was performed on the ADNI database. Mean±SD hippocampal volume (mm3) was 5195±656 for controls; 4786±781 for MCI; and 4427±903 for Alzheimer's disease patients and hippocampal atrophy rates (%/year) of 1.09±3.0, 2.74±3.5 and 4.04±3.6 respectively. Statistically significant (p &lt; 10 - 3) differences were found between disease groups for both hippocampal volume and volume change rates. Finally, STEPS was also applied in a multi-label segmentation propagation scenario using a leave-one-out cross validation, in order to parcellate 83 separate structures of the brain. Comparisons of STEPS with state-of-the-art multi-label fusion algorithms showed statistically significant segmentation accuracy improvements (p &lt; 10 - 4) in several key structures. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper aims to study the abnormal patterns of brain glucose metabolism co-variations in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) patients compared to Normal healthy controls (NC) using the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The local cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in a set of 90 structures belonging to the AAL atlas was obtained from Fluro-Deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography data in resting state. It is assumed that brain regions whose CMRgl values are significantly correlated are functionally associated; therefore, when metabolism is altered in a single region, the alteration will affect the metabolism of other brain areas with which it interrelates. The glucose metabolism network (represented by the matrix of the CMRgl co-variations among all pairs of structures) was studied using the graph theory framework. The highest concurrent fluctuations in CMRgl were basically identified between homologous cortical regions in all groups. Significant differences in CMRgl co-variations in AD and MCI groups as compared to NC were found. The AD and MCI patients showed aberrant patterns in comparison to NC subjects, as detected by global and local network properties (global and local efficiency, clustering index, and others). MCI network's attributes showed an intermediate position between NC and AD, corroborating it as a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer disease. Our study is an attempt at exploring the complex association between glucose metabolism, CMRgl covariations and the attributes of the brain network organization in AD and MCI. © 2013 Sanabria-Diaz et al.},

abstract={Hypothermia has been proposed as a treatment for reducing neuronal damage in the brain induced by hypoxic ischemia. In the developing brain, hypoxic ischemia-induced injury may give rise to cerebral palsy (CP). However, it is unknown whether hypothermia might affect the development of CP. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether hypothermia would have a protective effect on the brains of immature, 3-day old (P3) mice after a challenge of cerebral ischemia. Cerebral ischemia was induced in P3 mice with a right common carotid artery ligation followed by hypoxia (6% O2, 37°C) for 30 min. Immediately after hypoxic ischemia, mice were exposed to hypothermia (32°C) or normothermia (37°C) for 24 h. At 4 weeks of age, mouse motor development was tested in a behavioral test. Mice were sacrificed at P4, P7, and 5 weeks to examine brain morphology. The laminar structure of the cortex was examined with immunohistochemistry (Cux1/Ctip2); the number of neurons was counted; and the expression of myelin basic protein (MBP) was determined. The hypothermia treatment was associated with improved neurological outcomes in the behavioral test. In the normothermia group, histological analyses indicated reduced numbers of neurons, reduced cortical laminar thickness in the deep, ischemic cortical layers, and significant reduction in MBP expression in the ischemic cortex compared to the contralateral cortex. In the hypothermia group, no reductions were noted in deep cortical layer thickness and in MBP expression in the ischemic cortex compared to the contralateral cortex. At 24 h after the hypothermia treatment prevented the neuronal cell death that had predominantly occurred in the ischemic cortical deep layers with normothermia treatment. Our findings may provide a preclinical basis for testing hypothermal therapies in patients with CP induced by hypoxic ischemia in the preterm period. © 2013 Kida et al.},

abstract={To identify brain transcriptional networks that may predispose an animal to consume alcohol, we used weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Candidate coexpression modules are those with an eigengene expression level that correlates significantly with the level of alcohol consumption across a panel of BXD recombinant inbred mouse strains, and that share a genomic region that regulates the module transcript expression levels (mQTL) with a genomic region that regulates alcohol consumption (bQTL). To address a controversy regarding utility of gene expression profiles from whole brain, vs specific brain regions, as indicators of the relationship of gene expression to phenotype, we compared candidate coexpression modules from whole brain gene expression data (gathered with Affymetrix 430 v2 arrays in the Colorado laboratories) and from gene expression data from 6 brain regions (nucleus accumbens (NA); prefrontal cortex (PFC); ventral tegmental area (VTA); striatum (ST); hippocampus (HP); cerebellum (CB)) available from GeneNetwork. The candidate modules were used to construct candidate eigengene networks <underline>across</underline> brain regions, resulting in three "meta-modules", composed of candidate modules from two or more brain regions (NA, PFC, ST, VTA) and whole brain. To mitigate the potential influence of chromosomal location of transcripts and cis-eQTLs in linkage disequilibrium, we calculated a semi-partial correlation of the transcripts in the meta-modules with alcohol consumption conditional on the transcripts' cis-eQTLs. The function of transcripts that retained the correlation with the phenotype after correction for the strong genetic influence, implicates processes of protein metabolism in the ER and Golgi as influencing susceptibility to variation in alcohol consumption. Integration of these data with human GWAS provides further information on the function of polymorphisms associated with alcohol-related traits. © 2013 Vanderlinden et al.},

abstract={Background:Magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) are of particular interest in biomedical research, and have been exploited for molecular separation, gene/drug delivery, magnetic resonance imaging, and hyperthermic cancer therapy. In the case of cultured cells, magnetic manipulation of NPs provides the means for studying processes induced by mechanotransduction or by local clustering of targeted macromolecules, e.g. cell surface receptors. The latter are normally activated by binding of their natural ligands mediating key signaling pathways such as those associated with the epidermal growth factor (EGFR). However, it has been reported that EGFR may be dimerized and activated even in the absence of ligands. The present study assessed whether receptor clustering induced by physical means alone suffices for activating EGFR in quiescent cells.Methodology/Principal Findings:The EGFR on A431 cells was specifically targeted by superparamagnetic iron oxide NPs (SPIONs) carrying either a ligand-blocking monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody or a streptavidin molecule for targeting a chimeric EGFR incorporating a biotinylated amino-terminal acyl carrier peptide moiety. Application of a magnetic field led to SPION magnetization and clustering, resulting in activation of the EGFR, a process manifested by auto and transphosphorylation and downstream signaling. The magnetically-induced early signaling events were similar to those inherent to the ligand dependent EGFR pathways. Magnetization studies indicated that the NPs exerted magnetic dipolar forces in the sub-piconewton range with clustering dependent on Brownian motion of the receptor-SPION complex and magnetic field strength.Conclusions/Significance:We demonstrate that EGFR on the cell surface that have their ligand binding-pocket blocked by an antibody are still capable of transphosphorylation and initiation of signaling cascades if they are clustered by SPIONs either attached locally or targeted to another site of the receptor ectodomain. The results suggest that activation of growth factor receptors may be triggered by ligand-independent molecular crowding resulting from overexpression and/or sequestration in membrane microdomains. © 2013 Bharde et al.},

The "membrane surrounding hemozoin" has been observed in infected cells but has not been observed in in vitro experiments. This study focused on observing the association of phospholipid membranes and synthetic β-hematin, which is chemically identical to hemozoin, and on a further exploration into the mechanism of phospholipid membrane-induced β-hematin formation. Our results showed that β-hematin formation was induced by phospholipids in the fluid phase but not in the gel phase. The ability of phospholipids to induce β-hematin formation was inversely correlated with gel-to-liquid phase transition temperatures, suggesting an essential insertion of heme into the hydrocarbon chains of the phospholipid membrane to form β-hematin. For this study, a cryogenic transmission electron microscope was used to achieve the first direct observation of the formation of a monolayer of phospholipid membrane surrounding β-hematin. © 2013 Huy et al.},

abstract={Minichromosome maintenance protein 10 (Mcm10) is an essential eukaryotic DNA-binding replication factor thought to serve as a scaffold to coordinate enzymatic activities within the replisome. Mcm10 appears to function as an oligomer rather than in its monomeric form (or rather than as a monomer). However, various orthologs have been found to contain 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 subunits and thus, this issue has remained controversial. Here, we show that self-association of Xenopus laevis Mcm10 is mediated by a conserved coiled-coil (CC) motif within the N-terminal domain (NTD). Crystallographic analysis of the CC at 2.4 Å resolution revealed a three-helix bundle, consistent with the formation of both dimeric and trimeric Mcm10 CCs in solution. Mutation of the side chains at the subunit interface disrupted in vitro dimerization of both the CC and the NTD as monitored by analytical ultracentrifugation. In addition, the same mutations also impeded self-interaction of the full-length protein in vivo, as measured by yeast-two hybrid assays. We conclude that Mcm10 likely forms dimers or trimers to promote its diverse functions during DNA replication. © 2013 Du et al.},

A microarray comparison of L. monocytogenes between the transcriptome of the strong biofilm forming strain (Bfms) Scott A and the weak biofilm forming (Bfmw) strain F2365 was conducted to identify genes potentially involved in biofilm formation. Among 951 genes with significant difference in expression between the two strains, a GntR-family response regulator encoding gene (LMOf2365_0414), designated lbrA, was found to be highly expressed in Scott A relative to F2365. A Scott A lbrA-deletion mutant, designated AW3, formed biofilm to a much lesser extent as compared to the parent strain by a rapid attachment assay and scanning electron microscopy. Complementation with lbrA from Scott A restored the Bfms phenotype in the AW3 derivative. A second microarray assessment using the lbrA deletion mutant AW3 and the wild type Scott A revealed a total of 304 genes with expression significantly different between the two strains, indicating the potential regulatory role of LbrA in L. monocytogenes. A cloned copy of Scott A lbrA was unable to confer enhanced biofilm forming potential in F2365, suggesting that additional factors contributed to weak biofilm formation by F2365. © 2013 Wassinger et al.},

abstract={Hemagglutinin is the major surface glycoprotein of influenza viruses. It participates in the initial steps of viral infection through receptor binding and membrane fusion events. The influenza pandemic of 2009 provided a unique scenario to study virus evolution. We performed molecular dynamics simulations with four hemagglutinin variants that appeared throughout the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic. We found that variant 1 (S143G, S185T) likely arose to avoid immune recognition. Variant 2 (A134T), and variant 3 (D222E, P297S) had an increased binding affinity for the receptor. Finally, variant 4 (E374K) altered hemagglutinin stability in the vicinity of the fusion peptide. Variants 1 and 4 have become increasingly predominant, while variants 2 and 3 declined as the pandemic progressed. Our results show some of the different strategies that the influenza virus uses to adapt to the human host and provide an example of how selective pressure drives antigenic drift in viral proteins. © 2013 Jimenez-Alberto et al.},

abstract={The DNA recombination and repair machinery of Mycoplasma pneumoniae is composed of a limited set of approximately 11 proteins. Two of these proteins were predicted to be encoded by neighboring open reading frames (ORFs) MPN340 and MPN341. Both ORFs were found to have sequence similarity with genes that encode proteins belonging to the DNA helicase superfamily 1 (SF1). Interestingly, while a homolog of the MPN341 ORF is present in the genome of Mycoplasma genitalium (ORF MG244), MPN340 is an M. pneumoniae-specific ORF that is not found in other mycoplasmas. Moreover, the length of MPN340 (1590 base pairs [bp]) is considerably shorter than that of MPN341 (2148 bp). Examination of the MPN340-encoded amino acid sequence indicated that it may lack a so-called 2B subdomain, which is found in most SF1 DNA helicases. Also, the MPN340-encoded amino acid sequence was found to differ between subtype 1 strain M129 and subtype 2 strain FH at three amino acid positions. Both protein variants, which were termed PcrAs M129 and PcrAs FH, respectively, as well as the MPN341- and MG244-encoded proteins (PcrAMpn and PcrAMge, respectively), were purified, and tested for their ability to interact with DNA. While PcrAMpn and PcrAMge were found to bind preferentially to single-stranded DNA, both PcrAs M129 and PcrAs FH did not demonstrate significant DNA binding. However, all four proteins were found to have divalent cation- and ATP-dependent DNA helicase activity. The proteins displayed highest activity on partially double-stranded DNA substrates carrying 3′ single-stranded extensions. © 2013 Estevão et al.},

abstract={There is a substantial literature on the use of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to estimate effective population size using unlinked loci. The Ne estimates are extremely sensitive to the sampling process, and there is currently no theory to cope with the possible biases. We derive formulae for the analysis of idealised populations mating at random with multi-allelic (microsatellite) loci. The 'Burrows composite index' is introduced in a novel way with a 'composite haplotype table'. We show that in a sample of diploid size S, the mean value of x2 or r2 from the composite haplotype table is biased by a factor of 1-1/(2S-1)2, rather than the usual factor 1+1/(2S-1) for a conventional haplotype table. But analysis of population data using these formulae leads to Ne estimates that are unrealistically low. We provide theory and simulation to show that this bias towards low Ne estimates is due to null alleles, and introduce a randomised permutation correction to compensate for the bias. We also consider the effect of introducing a within-locus disequilibrium factor to r2, and find that this factor leads to a bias in the Ne estimate. However this bias can be overcome using the same randomised permutation correction, to yield an altered r2 with lower variance than the original r2, and one that is also insensitive to null alleles. The resulting formulae are used to provide Ne estimates on 40 samples of the Queensland fruit fly, Bactrocera tryoni, from populations with widely divergent Ne expectations. Linkage relationships are known for most of the microsatellite loci in this species. We find that there is little difference in the estimated Ne values from using known unlinked loci as compared to using all loci, which is important for conservation studies where linkage relationships are unknown. © 2013 Sved et al.},

abstract={A functional capsid protein (CP) is essential for host plant infection and insect transmission of Tomato yellow leaf curl virus (TYLCV) and other monopartite begomoviruses. We have previously shown that TYLCV CP specifically interacts with the heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) of the virus insect vector, Bemisia tabaci. Here we demonstrate that during the development of tomato plant infection with TYLCV, a significant amount of HSP70 shifts from a soluble form into insoluble aggregates. CP and HSP70 co-localize in these aggregates, first in the cytoplasm, then in the nucleus of cells associated with the vascular system. CP-HSP70 interaction was demonstrated by co-immunopreciptation in cytoplasmic - but not in nuclear extracts from leaf and stem. Inhibition of HSP70 expression by quercetin caused a decrease in the amount of nuclear CP aggregates and a re-localization of a GFP-CP fusion protein from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. HSP70 inactivation resulted in a decrease of TYLCV DNA levels, demonstrating the role of HSP70 in TYLCV multiplication in planta. The current study reveals for the first time the involvement of plant HSP70 in TYLCV CP intracellular movement. As described earlier, nuclear aggregates contained TYLCV DNA-CP complexes and infectious virions. Showing that HSP70 localizes in these large nuclear aggregates infers that these structures operate as nuclear virus factories. © 2013 Gorovits et al.},

abstract={Seaweeds are key species of the Baltic Sea benthic ecosystems. They are the substratum of numerous fouling epibionts like bryozoans and tubeworms. Several of these epibionts bear calcified structures and could be impacted by the high pCO2 events of the late summer upwellings in the Baltic nearshores. Those events are expected to increase in strength and duration with global change and ocean acidification. If calcifying epibionts are impacted by transient acidification as driven by upwelling events, their increasing prevalence could cause a shift of the fouling communities toward fleshy species. The aim of the present study was to test the sensitivity of selected seaweed macrofoulers to transient elevation of pCO2 in their natural microenvironment, i.e. the boundary layer covering the thallus surface of brown seaweeds. Fragments of the macroalga Fucus serratus bearing an epibiotic community composed of the calcifiers Spirorbis spirorbis (Annelida) and Electra pilosa (Bryozoa) and the non-calcifier Alcyonidium hirsutum (Bryozoa) were maintained for 30 days under three pCO2 conditions: natural 460±59 μatm, present-day upwelling1193±166 μatm and future upwelling 3150±446 μatm. Only the highest pCO2 caused a significant reduction of growth rates and settlement of S. spirorbis individuals. Additionally, S. spirorbis settled juveniles exhibited enhanced calcification of 40% during daylight hours compared to dark hours, possibly reflecting a day-night alternation of an acidification-modulating effect by algal photosynthesis as opposed to an acidification-enhancing effect of algal respiration. E. pilosa colonies showed significantly increased growth rates at intermediate pCO2 (1193 μatm) but no response to higher pCO2. No effect of acidification on A. hirsutum colonies growth rates was observed. The results suggest a remarkable resistance of the algal macro-epibionts to levels of acidification occurring at present day upwellings in the Baltic. Only extreme future upwelling conditions impacted the tubeworm S. spirorbis, but not the bryozoans. © 2013 Saderne, Wahl.},

abstract={When attempting to estimate the impacts of future climate change it is important to reflect on information gathered during the past. Understanding historical trends may also aid in the assessment of likely future agricultural and horticultural changes. The timing of agricultural activities, such as grape harvest dates, is known to be influenced by climate and weather. However, fewer studies have been carried out on grapevine yield and quality. In this paper an analysis is undertaken of long-term data from the period 1805-2010 on grapevine yield (hl/ha) and must sugar content (°Oe) and their relation to temperature. Monthly mean temperatures were obtained for the same time period. Multiple regression was used to relate the viticulture variables to temperature, and long-term trends were calculated. Overall, the observed trends over time are compatible with results from other long term studies. The findings confirm a relationship between yield, must sugar content and temperature data; increased temperatures were associated with higher yields and higher must sugar content. However, the potential increase in yield is currently limited by legislation, while must sugar content is likely to further increase with rising temperatures. © 2013 Bock et al.},

Simple models of human progenitor cells development depend in the main on the use of xenogeneic systems which may provide some limitations to development.Methods and Findings:Here we provide evidence that a simple model system which utilises both human keratinocyte and fibroblast cell lines arrayed on a synthetic tantalum coated matrix provides a permissive environment for the development of human CD34? haematopoietic cells into mature CD4? or CD8? T lymphocytes in the presence of Interleukin 7 (IL-7), Interleukin 15 (IL-15) and the Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L). This system was used to compare the ability of CD34+ cells to produce mature thymocytes and showed that whilst these cells derived from cord blood were able to productively differentiate into thymocytes the system was not permissive for the development of CD34+ cells from adult peripheral blood.Conclusions/Significance:Our study provides direct evidence for the capacity of human cord blood CD34+ cells to differentiate along the T lineage in a simple human model system. Productive commitment of the CD34? cells to generate T cells was found to be dependent on a three-dimensional matrix which induced the up-regulation of the Notch delta-like ligand 4 (Dll-4) by epithelial cells. © 2013 Lapenna et al.},

abstract={Abnormal deposition of neuriticplaques is the uniqueneuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD).Amyloid β protein (Aβ), the major component of plaques, is generated from sequential cleavage of amyloidβ precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase and γ-secretase complex. Patients with diabetes mellitus (DM), characterized by chronic hyperglycemia,have increased risk of AD development.However, the role of high blood glucose in APP processing and Aβ generation remains elusive. In this study, we investigated the effect of high glucose on APP metabolism and Aβ generation in cultured human cells. We found that high glucose treatment significantly increased APP protein level in both neuronal-like and non-neuronal cells, and promoted Aβ generation. Furthermore, we found that high glucose-induced increase of APP level was not due to enhancement of APP gene transcription but resulted from inhibition of APP protein degradation. Taken together, our data indicated that hyperglycemia could promote AD pathogenesis by inhibiting APP degradation and enhancing Aβ production. More importantly, the elevation of APP level and Aβ generation by high glucose was caused by reduction of APP turnover rate.Thus,our study provides a molecular mechanism of increased risk of developing AD in patients withDMand suggests thatglycemic control might be potentially beneficial for reducing the incidence of AD in diabetic patients and delaying the AD progression. © 2013 Yang et al.},

At the scale of hundreds of meters, fine-grained abiotic conditions (i.e., vegetation structure) are fundamental determinants of the occurrence of both life stages, whereas the effect of biotic factors is mostly contained in the abiotic signature. The combination of dense heath vegetation and bare ground areas is thus the first requirement for the species' preservation, provided that accessibility to the suitable habitat is ensured. At a smaller scale (centimetres), the influence of abiotic factors on larval occurrence becomes negligible, suggesting the existence of important additional variables acting within larval proximity. Sustained significant correlations between neighbouring larvae in the models provide an indication of the potential impact of neighbourhood crowding on the larval niche within a few centimetres. Since the species spends the majority of its life cycle in the larval stage, it is essential to consider the hierarchical abiotic and biotic processes affecting the larvae when designing practical conservation guidelines for the species. This underlines the necessity for a more critical evaluation of the consequences of disregarding niche variation between life stages when estimating niches and addressing effective conservation measures for species with complex life cycles. © 2013 Taboada et al.},

abstract={Background:The glucokinase regulatory protein encoded by GCKR plays an important role in glucose metabolism and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs1260326 (P446L) in the gene has been associated with several age-related biomarkers, including triglycerides, glucose, insulin and apolipoproteins. However, associations between SNPs in the gene and other ageing phenotypes such as cognitive and physical capability have not been reported.Methods:As part of the Healthy Ageing across the Life Course (HALCyon) collaborative research programme, men and women from five UK cohorts aged between 44 and 90+ years were genotyped for rs1260326. Meta-analysis was used to pool within-study genotypic associations between the SNP and several age-related phenotypes, including body mass index (BMI), blood lipid levels, lung function, and cognitive and physical capability.Results:We confirm the associations between the minor allele of the SNP and higher triglycerides and lower glucose levels. We also observed a triglyceride-independent association between the minor allele and lower BMI (pooled beta on z-score = -0.04, p-value = 0.0001, n = 16,251). Furthermore, there was some evidence for gene-environment interactions, including physical activity attenuating the effects on triglycerides. However, no associations were observed with measures of cognitive and physical capability.Conclusion:Findings from middle-aged to older adults confirm associations between rs1260326 GCKR and triglycerides and glucose, suggest possible gene-environment interactions, but do not provide evidence that its relevance extends to cognitive and physical capability. © 2013 Alfred et al.},

abstract={Background:Little is known about the variability of CD4 counts in the general population of sub-Saharan Africa countries affected by the HIV epidemic. We investigated factors associated with CD4 counts in a rural area in South Africa with high HIV prevalence and high antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage.Methods:CD4 counts, health status, body mass index (BMI), demographic characteristics and HIV status were assessed in 4990 adult resident participants of a demographic surveillance in rural KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa; antiretroviral treatment duration was obtained from a linked clinical database. Multivariable regression analysis, overall and stratified by HIV status, was performed with CD4 count levels as outcome.Results:Median CD4 counts were significantly higher in women than in men overall (714 vs. 630 cells/μl, p<0.0001), both in HIV-uninfected (833 vs. 683 cells/μl, p<0.0001) and HIV-infected adults (384.5 vs. 333 cells/μl, p<0.0001). In multivariable regression analysis, women had 19.4% (95% confidence interval (CI) 16.1-22.9) higher CD4 counts than men, controlling for age, HIV status, urban/rural residence, household wealth, education, BMI, self-reported tuberculosis, high blood pressure, other chronic illnesses and sample processing delay. At ART initiation, HIV-infected adults had 21.7% (95% CI 14.6-28.2) lower CD4 counts than treatment-naive individuals; CD4 counts were estimated to increase by 9.2% (95% CI 6.2-12.4) per year of treatment.Conclusions:CD4 counts are primarily determined by sex in HIV-uninfected adults, and by sex, age and duration of antiretroviral treatment in HIV-infected adults. Lower CD4 counts at ART initiation in men could be a consequence of lower CD4 cell counts before HIV acquisition. © 2013 Malaza et al.},

abstract={Cerebellar cortical functions rely on precisely arranged cytoarchitectures composed of several distinct types of neurons and glias. Studies have indicated that cerebellar excitatory and inhibitory neurons have distinct spatial origins, the upper rhombic lip (uRL) and ventricular zone (VZ), respectively, and that different types of neurons have different birthdates. However, the spatiotemporal relationship between uRL/VZ progenitors and their final phenotype remains poorly understood due to technical limitations. To address this issue, we performed in utero electroporation (IUE) of fluorescent protein plasmids using mouse embryos to label uRL/VZ progenitors at specific developmental stages, and observed labeled cells at maturity. To overcome any potential dilution of the plasmids caused by progenitor division, we also utilized constructs that enable permanent labeling of cells. Cerebellar neurons and glias were labeled in a Golgi-like manner enabling ready identification of labeled cells. Five types of cerebellar neurons, namely Purkinje, Golgi, Lugaro and unipolar brush cells, large-diameter deep nuclei (DN) neurons, and DN astrocytes were labeled by conventional plasmids, whereas plasmids that enable permanent labeling additionally labeled stellate, basket, and granule cells as well as three types of glias. IUE allows us to label uRL/VZ progenitors at different developmental stages. We found that the five types of neurons and DN astrocytes were labeled in an IUE stage-dependent manner, while stellate, basket, granule cells and three types of glias were labeled regardless of the IUE stage. Thus, the results indicate the IUE is an efficient method to track the development of cerebellar cells from uRL/VZ progenitors facing the ventricular lumen. They also indicate that while the generation of the five types of neurons by uRL/VZ progenitors is regulated in a time-dependent manner, the progenitor pool retains multipotency throughout embryonic development. © 2013 Kita et al.},

abstract={Background:India, with a population of more than 1.21 billion, has the highest maternal mortality in the world (estimated to be 56000 in 2010); and adolescent (aged 15-19) mortality shares 9% of total maternal deaths. Addressing the maternity care needs of adolescents may have considerable ramifications for achieving the Millennium Development Goal (MDG)-5. This paper assesses the socioeconomic differentials in accessing full antenatal care and professional attendance at delivery by adolescent mothers (aged 15-19) in India during 1990-2006.Methods and Findings:Data from three rounds of the National Family Health Survey of India conducted during 1992-93, 1998-99, and 2005-06 were analyzed. The Cochran-Armitage and Chi-squared test for linear and non-linear time trends were applied, respectively, to understand the trend in the proportion of adolescent mothers utilizing select maternity care services during 1990-2006. Using pooled multivariate logistic regression models, the probability of select maternal healthcare utilization among women by key socioeconomic characteristics was appraised. After adjusting for potential socio-demographic and economic characteristics, the likelihood of adolescents accessing full antenatal care increased by only 4% from 1990 to 2006. However, the probability of adolescent women availing themselves of professional attendance at delivery increased by 79% during the same period. The study also highlights the desolate disparities in maternity care services among adolescents across the most and the least favoured groups.Conclusion:Maternal care interventions in India need focused programs for rural, uneducated, poor adolescent women so that they can avail themselves of measures to delay child bearing, and for better antenatal consultation and delivery care in case of pregnancy. This study strongly advocates the promotion of a comprehensive 'adolescent scheme' along the lines of 'Continuum of Maternal, Newborn and Child health Care' to address the unmet need of reproductive and maternal healthcare services among adolescent women in India. © 2013 Kumar et al.},

abstract={Background:Ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) is used to identify rare sequence variants. The sequence depth is influenced by several factors including the error frequency of PCR and UDPS. This study investigated the characteristics and source of errors in raw and cleaned UDPS data.Results:UDPS of a 167-nucleotide fragment of the HIV-1 SG3Δenv plasmid was performed on the Roche/454 platform. The plasmid was diluted to one copy, PCR amplified and subjected to bidirectional UDPS on three occasions. The dataset consisted of 47,693 UDPS reads. Raw UDPS data had an average error frequency of 0.30% per nucleotide site. Most errors were insertions and deletions in homopolymeric regions. We used a cleaning strategy that removed almost all indel errors, but had little effect on substitution errors, which reduced the error frequency to 0.056% per nucleotide. In cleaned data the error frequency was similar in homopolymeric and non-homopolymeric regions, but varied considerably across sites. These site-specific error frequencies were moderately, but still significantly, correlated between runs (r = 0.15-0.65) and between forward and reverse sequencing directions within runs (r = 0.33-0.65). Furthermore, transition errors were 48-times more common than transversion errors (0.052% vs. 0.001%; p<0.0001). Collectively the results indicate that a considerable proportion of the sequencing errors that remained after data cleaning were generated during the PCR that preceded UDPS.Conclusions:A majority of the sequencing errors that remained after data cleaning were introduced by PCR prior to sequencing, which means that they will be independent of platform used for next-generation sequencing. The transition vs. transversion error bias in cleaned UDPS data will influence the detection limits of rare mutations and sequence variants.},

abstract={Glucocorticoids (GCs) are frequently used to treat many of the acute disease manifestations associated with inflammatory and autoimmune disorders. However, Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are resistant to GC-induced apoptosis, which leads to the inefficiency of GCs in the treatment of type I interferon-related autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Therefore, compounds promoting pDC apoptosis may be helpful for improving the efficacy of GCs. In this study, we performed screening to identify microRNAs (miRNAs) involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis and found an array of miRNAs that may regulate pDC apoptosis. Among those demonstrating altered expression, 6 miRNAs were inhibited in TLR-activated pDCs. Bioinformatics analysis and functional studies indicated that miR-29b and miR-29c were 2 key miRNAs involved in TLR-inhibited GC-induced pDC apoptosis. Furthermore, both of these miRNAs promoted pDC apoptosis by directly targeting Mcl-1 and Bcl-2 in human primary pDCs. Our findings provide new targets that could improve the efficacy of GCs for the treatment of SLE. © 2013 Hong et al.},

abstract={Previous studies have shown that the small molecule iron transport inhibitor ferristatin (NSC30611) acts by down-regulating transferrin receptor-1 (TfR1) via receptor degradation. In this investigation, we show that another small molecule, ferristatin II (NSC8679), acts in a similar manner to degrade the receptor through a nystatin-sensitive lipid raft pathway. Structural domains of the receptor necessary for interactions with the clathrin pathway do not appear to be necessary for ferristatin II induced degradation of TfR1. While TfR1 constitutively traffics through clathrin-mediated endocytosis, with or without ligand, the presence of Tf blocked ferristatin II induced degradation of TfR1. This effect of Tf was lost in a ligand binding receptor mutant G647A TfR1, suggesting that Tf binding to its receptor interferes with the drug's activity. Rats treated with ferristatin II have lower TfR1 in liver. These effects are associated with reduced intestinal 59Fe uptake, lower serum iron and transferrin saturation, but no change in liver non-heme iron stores. The observed hypoferremia promoted by degradation of TfR1 by ferristatin II appears to be due to induced hepcidin gene expression. © 2013 Byrne et al.},

abstract={Hsp70 chaperones are involved in multiple biological processes and are recruited to specific processes by designated J domain-containing cochaperones, or J proteins. To understand the evolution and functions of chloroplast Hsp70s and J proteins, we identified the Arabidopsis chloroplast J protein constituency using a combination of genomic and proteomic database searches and individual protein import assays. We show that Arabidopsis chloroplasts have at least 19 J proteins, the highest number of confirmed J proteins for any organelle. These 19 J proteins are classified into 11 clades, for which cyanobacteria and glaucophytes only have homologs for one clade, green algae have an additional three clades, and all the other 7 clades are specific to land plants. Each clade also possesses a clade-specific novel motif that is likely used to interact with different client proteins. Gene expression analyses indicate that most land plant-specific J proteins show highly variable expression in different tissues and are down regulated by low temperatures. These results show that duplication of chloroplast Hsp70 in land plants is accompanied by more than doubling of the number of its J protein cochaperones through adding new J proteins with novel motifs, not through duplications within existing families. These new J proteins likely recruit chloroplast Hsp70 to perform tissue specific functions related to biosynthesis rather than to stress resistance. © 2013 Chiu et al.},

abstract={Salt stress is one of the major abiotic stresses in agriculture worldwide. Analysis of natural genetic variation in Arabidopsis is an effective approach to characterize candidate salt responsive genes. Differences in salt tolerance of three Arabidopsis ecotypes were compared in this study based on their responses to salt treatments at two developmental stages: seed germination and later growth. The Sha ecotype had higher germination rates, longer roots and less accumulation of superoxide radical and hydrogen peroxide than the Ler and Col ecotypes after short term salt treatment. With long term salt treatment, Sha exhibited higher survival rates and lower electrolyte leakage. Transcriptome analysis revealed that many genes involved in cell wall, photosynthesis, and redox were mainly down-regulated by salinity effects, while transposable element genes, microRNA and biotic stress related genes were significantly changed in comparisons of Sha vs. Ler and Sha vs. Col. Several pathways involved in tricarboxylic acid cycle, hormone metabolism and development, and the Gene Ontology terms involved in response to stress and defense response were enriched after salt treatment, and between Sha and other two ecotypes. Collectively, these results suggest that the Sha ecotype is preconditioned to withstand abiotic stress. Further studies about detailed gene function are needed. These comparative transcriptomic and analytical results also provide insight into the complexity of salt stress tolerance mechanisms. © 2013 Wang et al.},

abstract={Asperger syndrome (AS) is a neurodevelopmental condition within the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) characterized by specific difficulties in social interaction, communication and behavioural control. In recent years, it has been suggested that ASD is related to a dysfunction of action simulation processes, but studies employing imitation or action observation tasks provided mixed results. Here, we addressed action simulation processes in adolescents with AS by means of a motor imagery task, the classical hand laterality task (to decide whether a rotated hand image is left or right); mental rotation of letters was also evaluated. As a specific marker of action simulation in hand rotation, we assessed the so-called biomechanical effect, that is the advantage for judging hand pictures showing physically comfortable versus physically awkward positions. We found the biomechanical effect in typically-developing participants but not in participants with AS. Overall performance on both hand laterality and letter rotation tasks, instead, did not differ in the two groups. These findings demonstrated a specific alteration of motor imagery skills in AS. We suggest that impaired mental simulation and imitation of goal-less movements in ASD could be related to shared cognitive mechanisms. © 2013 Conson et al.},

abstract={In the Drosophila oocyte, gurken (grk) mRNA encodes a secreted TGF-α signal that specifies the future embryonic dorso-ventral axes by altering the fate of the surrounding epithelial follicle cells. We previously identified a number of RNA binding proteins that associate specifically with the 64 nucleotide grk localization signal, including the Drosophila orthologue of polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), Hephaestus (Heph). To test whether Heph is required for correct grk mRNA or protein function, we used immunoprecipitation to validate the association of Heph with grk mRNA and characterized the heph mutant phenotype. We found that Heph is a component of grk mRNP complexes but heph germline clones show that Heph is not required for grk mRNA localization. Instead, we identify a novel function for Heph in the germline and show that it is required for proper Grk protein localization. Furthermore, we show that Heph is required in the oocyte for the correct organization of the actin cytoskeleton and dorsal appendage morphogenesis. Our results highlight a requirement for an mRNA binding protein in the localization of Grk protein, which is independent of mRNA localization, and we propose that Heph is required in the germline for efficient Grk signalling to the somatic follicle cells during dorso-ventral patterning. © 2013 McDermott, Davis.},

abstract={Background:Auxin binding protein 1 (ABP1) is a putative auxin receptor and its function is indispensable for plant growth and development. ABP1 has been shown to be involved in auxin-dependent regulation of cell division and expansion, in plasma-membrane-related processes such as changes in transmembrane potential, and in the regulation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis. However, the ABP1-regulated downstream pathway remains elusive.Methodology/Principal Findings:Using auxin transport assays and quantitative analysis of cellular morphology we show that ABP1 regulates auxin efflux from tobacco BY-2 cells. The overexpression of ABP1can counterbalance increased auxin efflux and auxin starvation phenotypes caused by the overexpression of PIN auxin efflux carrier. Relevant mechanism involves the ABP1-controlled vesicle trafficking processes, including positive regulation of endocytosis of PIN auxin efflux carriers, as indicated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and pharmacological manipulations.Conclusions/Significance:The findings indicate the involvement of ABP1 in control of rate of auxin transport across plasma membrane emphasizing the role of ABP1 in regulation of PIN activity at the plasma membrane, and highlighting the relevance of ABP1 for the formation of developmentally important, PIN-dependent auxin gradients. © 2013 Čovanová et al.},

abstract={It is now commonly accepted that the intestinal microbiota plays a crucial role in the gut physiology and homeostasis, and that both qualitative and quantitative alterations in the compositions of the gut flora exert profound effects on the host's intestinal cells. In spite of this, the details of the interaction between commensal bacteria and intestinal cells are still largely unknown and only in few cases the molecular mechanisms have been elucidated. Here we analyze the effects of molecules produced and secreted by Lactobacillus gasseri SF1183 on human intestinal HCT116 cells. L. gasseri is a well known species of lactic acid bacteria, commonly associated to the human intestine and SF1183 is a human strain previously isolated from an ileal biopsy of an healthy volunteer. SF1183 produces and secretes, in a growth phase-dependent way, molecule(s) able to drastically interfere with HCT116 cell proliferation. Although several attempts to purify and identify the bioactive molecule(s) have been so far unsuccessful, a partial characterization has indicated that it is smaller than 3 kDa, thermostable and of proteinaceous nature. L. gasseri molecule(s) stimulate a G1-phase arrest of the cell cycle by up-regulation of p21WAF1 rendering cells protected from intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis. A L. gasseri-mediated reduction of apoptosis and of cell proliferation could be relevant in protecting epithelial barrier integrity and helping in reconstituting tissutal homeostasis. © 2013 Di Luccia et al.},

First, participants learned to decrease heart rate using biofeedback. Then, inter-individual differences in the acquired skill predicted how well they could decrease heart rate reactivity when later exposed to negative arousing pictures without biofeedback. These findings suggest that (i) short lasting biofeedback training improves heart rate regulation and (ii) the learned ability transfers to emotion challenging situations without biofeedback.

abstract={Angiogenesis is a critical factor in the growth and dissemination of solid tumors. Indeed, tumor vasculature is abnormal and contributes to the development and spread of malignancies by creating a hostile microenvironment. The alternative SDF-1/CXCL12 receptor, CXCR7, is frequently and specifically expressed in tumor-associated vessels. In this study, we examine the role of endothelium-expressed CXCR7 in tumor vascular dysfunction by specifically examining the contribution of CXCR7 to endothelial cell (EC) proliferation. We demonstrate that CXCR7 expression is sufficient to drive post-confluent growth in EC cultures. Further, we provide a novel mechanism for CXCR7-mediated proliferation via proteasomal degradation of the tumor suppressor protein Rb. These findings identify a heretofore unappreciated role for CXCR7 in vascular dysfunction and confirm this receptor as a plausible target for anti-tumor therapy. © 2013 Totonchy et al.},

abstract={Marine ecosystem is a complex nonlinear system. However, ecosystem health assessment conventionally builds on a linear superposition of changes in ecosystem components and probably fails to evaluate nonlinear interactions among various components. To better reflect the intrinsic interactions and their impacts on ecosystem health, an ecosystem coordination index, defined as the matching level of ecosystem structure/services, is proposed and incorporated into the ecosystem health index for a systematic diagnosis in the Pearl River Estuary, China. The analysis results show that the ecosystem health index over the last three decades decreased from 0.91 to 0.50, indicating deteriorating from healthy to unhealthy status. The health index is 3-16% lower than that calculated using the common method without considering ecosystem coordination. Ecosystem health degradation in the Pearl River Estuary manifested as significant decreases in structure/services and somewhat mismatching among them. Overall, the introduction of coordination in ecosystem health assessment could improve the understanding of the mechanism of marine ecosystem change and facilitate effective restoration of ecosystem health. © 2013 Chen et al.},

abstract={Introduction:Our retrospective cohort study investigated the effect of tumor site and stage on the associations between the allelic variants of glutathione S-transferase (GST) and DNA-repair genes and overall survival (OS) in CRC patients treated with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU)-based adjuvant chemotherapy.Material and Methods:We genotyped GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 Ile105Val, XRCC1 Arg399Gln, XRCC3 Thr241Met, and XPD Lys751Gln in 491 CRC patients between 1995 and 2001. A Cox proportional-hazards model was used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the relationships between the allelic variants and OS. Survival analyses were performed for each allelic variant by using the log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier analysis.Results:The CRC patients with the XPD Gln allelic variants had poorer survival than patients with the Lys/Lys genotype (HR = 1.38, 95% CI = 1.02-1.87), and rectal cancer patients had the poorest survival among them (HR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.18-2.95). A significantly shorter OS was observed among stage II/III colon cancer patients with the XRCC1 Gln allelic variants (HR = 1.69, 95% CI = 1.06-2.71), compared to those with XRCC1 Arg/Arg genotype. In the combined analysis of the XRCC1 and XPD genes patients with stage II/III tumors, the poorest OS occurred in colon cancer patients with the XRCC1 Gln and XPD Gln allelic variants (HR = 2.60, 95% CI = 1.19-5.71) and rectal cancer patients with the XRCC1 Arg/Arg and XPD Gln allelic variants (HR = 2.77, 95% CI = 1.25-6.17).Conclusion:The XPD and XRCC1 allelic variants may be prognostic markers for CRC patients receiving 5-FU based chemotherapy. The contributions of the XPD and XRCC1 allelic variants to OS are tumor site- and/or stage-dependent. © 2013 Lai et al.},

abstract={Background:Tamarindus indica (T. indica) is a medicinal plant with many biological activities including anti-diabetic, hypolipidaemic and anti-bacterial activities. A recent study demonstrated the hypolipidaemic effect of T. indica fruit pulp in hamsters. However, the biochemical and molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been fully elucidated. Hence, the aims of this study were to evaluate the antioxidant activities and potential hypocholesterolaemic properties of T. indica, using in vitro and in vivo approaches.Methodology/Principal Findings:The in vitro study demonstrated that T. indica fruit pulp had significant amount of phenolic (244.9±10.1 mg GAE/extract) and flavonoid (93.9±2.6 mg RE/g extract) content and possessed antioxidant activities. In the in vivo study, hamsters fed with high-cholesterol diet for ten weeks showed elevated serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, HDL-C and LDL-C levels. Administration of T. indica fruit pulp to hypercholesterolaemic hamsters significantly lowered serum triglyceride, total cholesterol and LDL-C levels but had no effect on the HDL-C level. The lipid-lowering effect was accompanied with significant increase in the expression of Apo A1, Abcg5 and LDL receptor genes and significant decrease in the expression of HMG-CoA reductase and Mtp genes. Administration of T. indica fruit pulp to hypercholesterolaemic hamsters also protected against oxidative damage by increasing hepatic antioxidant enzymes, antioxidant activities and preventing hepatic lipid peroxidation.Conclusion/Significance:It is postulated that tamarind fruit pulp exerts its hypocholesterolaemic effect by increasing cholesterol efflux, enhancing LDL-C uptake and clearance, suppressing triglyceride accumulation and inhibiting cholesterol biosynthesis. T. indica fruit pulp has potential antioxidative effects and is potentially protective against diet-induced hypercholesterolaemia. © 2013 Lim et al.},

abstract={Alveolar echinococcosis is a refractory disease caused by the metacestode stage of Echinococcus multilocularis. The life cycle of this parasite is maintained primarily between foxes and many species of rodents; thus, dogs are thought to be a minor definitive host except in some endemic areas. However, dogs are highly susceptible to E. multilocularis infection. Because of the close contact between dogs and humans, infection of dogs with this parasite can be an important risk to human health. Therefore, new measures and tools to control and prevent parasite transmission required. Using 2-dimensional electrophoresis followed by western blot (2D-WB) analysis, a large glycoprotein component of protoscoleces was identified based on reactivity to intestinal IgA in dogs experimentally infected with E. multilocularis. This component, designated SRf1, was purified by gel filtration using a Superose 6 column. Glycosylation analysis and immunostaining revealed that SRf1 could be distinguished from Em2, a major mucin-type antigen of E. multilocularis. Dogs (n = 6) were immunized intranasally with 500 μg of SRf1 with cholera toxin subunit B by using a spray syringe, and a booster was given orally using an enteric capsule containing 15 mg of the same antigen. As a result, dogs immunized with this antigen showed an 87.6% reduction in worm numbers compared to control dogs (n = 5) who received only PBS administration. A weak serum antibody response was observed in SRf1-immunized dogs, but there was no correlation between antibody response and worm number. We demonstrated for the first time that mucosal immunization using SRf1, a glycoprotein component newly isolated from E. multilocularis protoscoleces, induced a protection response to E. multilocularis infection in dogs. Thus, our data indicated that mucosal immunization using surface antigens will be an important tool to facilitate the development of practical vaccines for definitive hosts. © 2013 Kouguchi et al.},

abstract={Whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (RNA-seq) was used to assess the transcriptomic response of the toxic cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa during growth with low levels of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (low N), low levels of dissolved inorganic phosphorus (low P), and in the presence of high levels of high molecular weight dissolved organic matter (HMWDOM). Under low N, one third of the genome was differentially expressed, with significant increases in transcripts observed among genes within the nir operon, urea transport genes (urtBCDE), and amino acid transporters while significant decreases in transcripts were observed in genes related to photosynthesis. There was also a significant decrease in the transcription of the microcystin synthetase gene set under low N and a significant decrease in microcystin content per Microcystis cell demonstrating that N supply influences cellular toxicity. Under low P, 27% of the genome was differentially expressed. The Pho regulon was induced leading to large increases in transcript levels of the alkaline phosphatase phoX, the Pst transport system (pstABC), and the sphX gene, and transcripts of multiple sulfate transporter were also significantly more abundant. While the transcriptional response to growth on HMWDOM was smaller (5-22% of genes differentially expressed), transcripts of multiple genes specifically associated with the transport and degradation of organic compounds were significantly more abundant within HMWDOM treatments and thus may be recruited by Microcystis to utilize these substrates. Collectively, these findings provide a comprehensive understanding of the nutritional physiology of this toxic, bloom-forming cyanobacterium and the role of N in controlling microcystin synthesis. © 2013 Harke, Gobler.},

abstract={The necessary replacement of fish meal with other protein source in diets of commercially important fish has prompted the study of the effect of the inclusion of different vegetable proteins sources on growth performance and on the gastro-intestinal tract. Currently, soybean meal is the primary protein source as a fish meal replacement because of its low price and high availability. Likewise, it is been documented that the ingestion of soybean meal by several fish species, such as salmonids and carp, triggers a type of intestinal inflammation called enteritis. In this paper, we analyzed the effects of the ingestion of soybean meal and two of its components, soy protein and soy saponin, on zebrafish to establish the basis for using zebrafish larvae as a model for fish nutrition. We took advantage of the existence of different transgenic lines, which allowed us to perform in vivo analysis. Our results indicated that larvae that were feed with soybean meal developed a clear intestinal inflammation as early as two day after beginning the diet. Moreover, we determined that is not the soy protein present in the diet but the soy saponin that is primarily responsible for triggering the immune response. These findings support the use of zebrafish screening assays to identify novel ingredients that would to improved current fish diets or would formulate new ones. © 2013 Hedrera et al.},

abstract={The present study was designed to determine the underlying mechanism of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) induced alveolar bone remodeling and the role of BMP-2 expression in a rat orthodontic tooth movement model. Orthodontic appliances were placed between the homonymy upper first molars and the upper central incisors in rats under general anesthesia, followed by daily 20-min LIPUS or sham LIPUS treatment beginning at day 0. Tooth movement distances and molecular changes were evaluated at each observation point. In vitro and in vivo studies were conducted to detect HGF (Hepatocyte growth factor)/Runx2/BMP-2 signaling pathways and receptor activator of NFκB ligand (RANKL) expression by quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR), Western blot and immunohistochemistry. At day 3, LIPUS had no effect on the rat orthodontic tooth movement distance and BMP-2-induced alveolar bone remodeling. However, beginning at day 5 and for the following time points, LIPUS significantly increased orthodontic tooth movement distance and BMP-2 signaling pathway and RANKL expression compared with the control group. The qRT-PCR and Western blot data in vitro and in vivo to study BMP-2 expression were consistent with the immunohistochemistry observations. The present study demonstrates that LIPUS promotes alveolar bone remodeling by stimulating the HGF/Runx2/BMP-2 signaling pathway and RANKL expression in a rat orthodontic tooth movement model, and LIPUS increased BMP-2 expression via Runx2 regulation. © 2013 Xue et al.},

abstract={African horse sickness virus (AHSV) belongs to the genus Orbivirus. We have now engineered naked DNAs and recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (rMVA) expressing VP2 and NS1 proteins from AHSV-4. IFNAR(-/-) mice inoculated with DNA/rMVA-VP2,-NS1 from AHSV-4 in an heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy generated significant levels of neutralizing antibodies specific of AHSV-4. In addition, vaccination stimulated specific T cell responses against the virus. The vaccine elicited partial protection against an homologous AHSV-4 infection and induced cross-protection against the heterologous AHSV-9. Similarly, IFNAR(-/-) mice vaccinated with an homologous prime-boost strategy with rMVA-VP2-NS1 from AHSV-4 developed neutralizing antibodies and protective immunity against AHSV-4. Furthermore, the levels of immunity were very high since none of vaccinated animals presented viraemia when they were challenged against the homologous AHSV-4 and very low levels when they were challenged against the heterologous virus AHSV-9. These data suggest that the immunization with rMVA/rMVA was more efficient in protection against a virulent challenge with AHSV-4 and both strategies, DNA/rMVA and rMVA/rMVA, protected against the infection with AHSV-9. The inclusion of the protein NS1 in the vaccine formulations targeting AHSV generates promising multiserotype vaccines. © 2013 de la Poza et al.},

abstract={This study, conducted in the brain of a perciform fish, the European sea bass, aimed at raising antibodies against the precursor of the kisspeptins in order to map the kiss systems and to correlate the expression of kisspeptins, kiss1 and kiss2, with that of kisspeptin receptors (kiss-R1 and kiss-R2). Specific antibodies could be raised against the preprokiss2, but not the preoprokiss1. The data indicate that kiss2 neurons are mainly located in the hypothalamus and project widely to the subpallium and pallium, the preoptic region, the thalamus, the pretectal area, the optic tectum, the torus semicircularis, the mediobasal medial and caudal hypothalamus, and the neurohypophysis. These results were compared to the expression of kiss-R1 and kiss-R2 messengers, indicating a very good correlation between the wide distribution of Kiss2-positive fibers and that of kiss-R2 expressing cells. The expression of kiss-R1 messengers was more limited to the habenula, the ventral telencephalon and the proximal pars distalis of the pituitary. Attempts to characterize the phenotype of the numerous cells expressing kiss-R2 showed that neurons expressing tyrosine hydroxylase, neuropeptide Y and neuronal nitric oxide synthase are targets for kisspeptins, while GnRH1 neurons did not appear to express kiss-R1 or kiss-R2 messengers. In addition, a striking result was that all somatostatin-positive neurons expressed-kissR2. These data show that kisspeptins are likely to regulate a wide range of neuronal systems in the brain of teleosts. © 2013 Escobar et al.},

abstract={Introduction:The assessment of spinal deformities with rasterstereography can enhance the understanding, as well as can reduce the number of x-rays needed. However, to date this technique only allows measurements under static conditions. Since it would be of great value to be able to also analyze the spine in dynamic conditions, the present study evaluated a novel rasterstereographic system.Materials and Methods:A new rasterstereographic device was evaluated in a comparison with the gold standard in motion analysis, the VICON system. After initial testing using 12 flat infrared markers adhered to a solid plate, the two systems were evaluated with the markers adhered onto the backs of 8 test subjects. Four triangles were defined using the markers, and the sides of each triangle were measured under static and dynamic conditions.Results:On the solid plate, the sides of the 4 triangles were measured with a measuring tape and then by the two optical systems. Rasterstereography showed a high accuracy in marker detection on the solid plate. Under dynamic conditions, with the subjects walking on a treadmill, the rasterstereographically-measured side lengths were compared with the lengths measured by the VICON system as an assessment of marker detection. No significant differences (p>0.05) were found between the systems, differing only 0.07-1.1% for all sides of the four triangles with both systems.Discussion:A novel rasterstereographic measurement device that allows surface and spine topography under dynamic conditions was assessed. The accuracy of this system was with one millimeter on a solid plate and during dynamic measurements, to the gold standard for motion detection. The advantage of rasterstereography is that it can be used to determine a three-dimensional surface map and also allows the analysis of the underlying spine. © 2013 Betsch et al.},

abstract={Purpose:Postoperative respiratory failure is a major problem which can prolong the stay in the intensive care unit in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. We measured the serum levels of the soluble isoform of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE), and we studied its association with postoperative respiratory failure.Methods:Eighty-seven patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery were enrolled in this multicenter observational study in three university hospitals. Serum biomarker levels were measured perioperatively, and clinical data were collected for 7 days postoperatively. The duration of mechanical ventilation was studied for 28 days.Results:Serum levels of sRAGE elevated immediately after surgery (median, 1751 pg/mL; interquartile range (IQR) 1080-3034 pg/mL) compared with the level after anesthetic induction (median, 884 pg/mL; IQR, 568-1462 pg/mL). Postoperative sRAGE levels in patients undergoing off-pump coronary artery bypass grafting (median, 1193 pg/mL; IQR 737-1869 pg/mL) were significantly lower than in patients undergoing aortic surgery (median, 1883 pg/mL; IQR, 1406-4456 pg/mL; p = 0.0024) and valve surgery (median, 2302 pg/mL; IQR, 1447-3585 pg/mL; p = 0.0005), and postoperative sRAGE correlated moderately with duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (rs = 0.44, p&lt;0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that postoperative sRAGE had a predictive performance with area under the curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval 0.71-0.88) for postoperative respiratory failure, defined as prolonged mechanical ventilation &gt;3 days. The optimum cutoff value for prediction of respiratory failure was 3656 pg/mL, with sensitivity and specificity of 62% and 91%, respectively.Conclusions:Serum sRAGE levels elevated immediately after cardiac surgery, and the range of elevation was associated with the morbidity of postoperative respiratory failure. Early postoperative sRAGE levels appear to be linked to cardiopulmonary bypass, and may have predictive performance for postoperative respiratory failure; however, large-scale validation studies are needed. © 2013 Uchida et al.},

abstract={Background:There is a recognized gap in the evidence base relating to the nature and components of interventions to address the psycho-social needs of HIV positive young people. We used mixed methods research to strengthen a community support group intervention for HIV positive young people based in Harare, Zimbabwe.Methods:A quantitative questionnaire was administered to HIV positive Africaid support group attendees. Afterwards, qualitative data were collected from young people aged 15-18 through tape-recorded in-depth interviews (n = 10), 3 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 16 life history narratives. Data were also collected from caregivers, health care workers, and community members through FGDs (n = 6 groups) and in-depth interviews (n = 12). Quantitative data were processed and analysed using STATA 10. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis.Results:229/310 young people completed the quantitative questionnaire (74% participation). Median age was 14 (range 6-18 years); 59% were female. Self-reported adherence to antiretrovirals was sub-optimal. Psychological well being was poor (median score on Shona Symptom Questionnaire 9/14); 63% were at risk of depression. Qualitative findings suggested that challenges faced by positive children include verbal abuse, stigma, and discrimination. While data showed that support group attendance is helpful, young people stressed that life outside the confines of the group was more challenging. Caregivers felt ill-equipped to support the children in their care. These data, combined with a previously validated conceptual framework for family-centred interventions, were used to guide the development of the existing programme of adolescent support groups into a more comprehensive evidence-based psychosocial support programme encompassing caregiver and household members.Conclusions:This study allowed us to describe the lived experiences of HIV positive young people and their caregivers in Zimbabwe. The findings contributed to the enhancement of Africaid's existing programme of support to better promote psychological well being and ART adherence. © 2013 Mavhu et al.},

By applying multivariate Cox analysis, AKI was associated with an increased adjusted hazard ratio (AHR) for 30-day death of 3.51 (95% confidence interval [CI] 2.35-5.25, p<0.001) by RIFLE and 3.99 (CI 2.59-6.15, p<0.001) by KDIGO and with an AHR for 1-year mortality of 1.84 (CI 1.12-3.01, p = 0.016) by RIFLE and 2.43 (CI 1.62-3.62, p<0.001) by KDIGO. The subgroup of patients diagnosed as non-AKI by RIFLE but as AKI by KDIGO criteria had also an increased AHR for death of 2.55 (1.52-4.28) at 30 days and 2.28 (CI 1.46-3.54) at 1 year (p<0.001).Conclusions:KDIGO criteria detected substantially more AKI patients than RIFLE among AMI patients. Patients diagnosed as AKI by KDIGO but not RIFLE criteria had a significantly higher early and late mortality. In this study KDIGO criteria were more suitable for AKI diagnosis in AMI patients than RIFLE criteria. © 2013 Rodrigues et al.},

abstract={Background:Non-hormonal contraception methods have been widely used, but their effects on colonization by vaginal lactobacilli remain unclear.Objective:To determine the association between non-hormonal contraception methods and vaginal lactobacilli on women's reproductive health.Methods:The cross-sectional study included 164 healthy women between 18-45 years of age. The subjects were divided into different groups on the basis of the different non-hormonal contraception methods used by them. At the postmenstrual visit (day 21 or 22 of the menstrual cycle), vaginal swabs were collected for determination of Nugent score, quantitative culture and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of vaginal lactobacilli. The prevalence, colony counts and 16S rRNA gene expression of the Lactobacillus strains were compared between the different groups by Chi-square and ANOVA statistical analysis methods.Results:A Nugent score of 0-3 was more common in the condom group (93.1%) than in the group that used an interuterine device(IUD) (75.4%), (p = 0.005). The prevalence of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus was significantly higher in the condom group (82.3%) than in the IUD group (68.2%), (p = 0.016). There was a significant difference in colony count (mean ± standard error (SE), log10colony forming unit (CFU)/ml) of H2O2-producing Lactobacillus between condom users (7.81±0.14) and IUD users (6.54±0.14), (p = 0.000). The 16S rRNA gene expression (mean ± SE, log10copies/ml) of Lactobacillus crispatus was significantly higher in the condom group (8.09±0.16) than in the IUD group (6.03±0.18), (p = 0.000).Conclusion:Consistent condom use increases the colonization of Lactobacillus crispatus in the vagina and may protect against both bacterial vaginosis (BV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). © 2013 Ma et al.},

abstract={Passive immunotherapies utilising polyclonal antibodies could have a valuable role in preventing and treating infectious diseases such as influenza, particularly in pandemic situations but also in immunocompromised populations such as the elderly, the chronically immunosuppressed, pregnant women, infants and those with chronic diseases. The aim of this study was to optimise current methods used to generate ovine polyclonal antibodies. Polyclonal antibodies to baculovirus-expressed recombinant influenza haemagglutinin from A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 H1N1 (PR8) were elicited in sheep using various immunisation regimens designed to investigate the priming immunisation route, adjuvant formulation, sheep age, and antigen dose, and to empirically ascertain which combination maximised antibody output. The novel adjuvant CoVaccine HT™ was compared to Freund's adjuvant which is currently the adjuvant of choice for commercial production of ovine polyclonal Fab therapies. CoVaccine HT™ induced significantly higher titres of functional ovine anti-haemagglutinin IgG than Freund's adjuvant but with fewer side effects, including reduced site reactions. Polyclonal hyperimmune sheep sera effectively neutralised influenza virus in vitro and, when given before or after influenza virus challenge, prevented the death of infected mice. Neither the age of the sheep nor the route of antigen administration appeared to influence antibody titre. Moreover, reducing the administrated dose of haemagglutinin antigen minimally affected antibody titre. Together, these results suggest a cost effective way of producing high and sustained yields of functional ovine polyclonal antibodies specifically for the prevention and treatment of globally significant diseases. © 2013 Stevens et al.},

abstract={Insect odorant receptors function as heteromeric odorant-gated cation channels comprising a conventional odorant-sensitive tuning receptor, and a conserved co-receptor (Orco). An Orco agonist, VUAA1, is able to activate both heteromeric and homomeric Orco-containing channels. Very little is known about specific residues in Orco that contribute to cation permeability and gating. We investigated the importance of two conserved Asp residues, one in each of transmembrane domains 5 and 7, for channel function by mutagenesis. Drosophila melanogaster Orco and its substitution mutants were expressed in HEK cells and VUAA1-stimulated channel activity was determined by Ca2+ influx and whole-cell patch clamp electrophysiology. Substitution of D466 in transmembrane 7 with amino acids other than glutamic acid resulted in a substantial reduction in channel activity. The D466E Orco substitution mutant was ∼2 times more sensitive to VUAA1. The permeability of the D466E Orco mutant to cations was unchanged relative to wild-type Orco. When D466E Orco is co-expressed with a conventional tuning odorant receptor, the heteromeric complex also shows increased sensitivity to an odorant. Thus, the effect of the D466E mutation is not specific to VUAA1 agonism or dependent on homomeric Orco assembly. We suggest the gain-of-activation characteristic of the D466E mutant identifies an amino acid that is likely to be important for activation of both heteromeric and homomeric insect odorant receptor channels. © 2013 Kumar et al.},

abstract={Background:Some syphilis patients remain in a serologically active state after the recommended therapy. We currently know too little about the characteristics of this serological response.Methods:We conducted a cohort study using the clinical database from Zhongshan Hospital, Medical College of Xiamen. In total, 1,327 HIV-negative patients with primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis were enrolled. Bivariate and multivariate analyses were utilised to identify factors associated with a serological cure and serofast state in syphilis patients one year after therapy. Chi-square tests were used to determine the differences in the serological cure rate across different therapy time points.Results:One year after the recommended therapy, 870 patients achieved a serological cure, and 457 patients (34.4%) remained in the serofast state. The serological cure rate increased only within the first 6 months. The bivariate analysis indicated that male or younger patients had a higher likelihood of a serological cure than female or older patients. Having a baseline titre ≤1:2 or ≥1:64 was associated with an increased likelihood of a serological cure. The serological cure rate decreased for the different disease stages in the order of primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary syphilis. A distinction should be drawn between early and late syphilis. The multivariate analysis indicated that a serological cure was significantly associated with the disease phase, gender, age, and baseline rapid plasma reagin (RPR) titre.Conclusions:The serofast state is common in clinical work. After one year of the recommended therapy, quite a few syphilis patients remained RPR positive. The primary endpoint of the study indicated that disease phase, gender, age and baseline RPR titre were crucial factors associated with a serological cure. © 2013 Yang et al.},

abstract={The relative proportions of components in a pheromone blend play a major role in sexual recognition in moths. Two sympatric species, Helicoverpa armigera and Helicoverpa assulta, use (Z)-11-hexadecenal (Z11-16: Ald) and (Z)-9-hexadecenal (Z9-16: Ald) as essential sex pheromone components but in very different ratios, 97:3 and 7:93 respectively. Using wind tunnel tests, single sensillum recording and in vivo calcium imaging, we comparatively studied behavioral responses and physiological activities at the level of antennal sensilla and antennal lobe (AL) in males of the two species to blends of the two pheromone components in different ratios (100:0, 97:3, 50:50, 7:93, 0:100). Z11-16: Ald and Z9-16: Ald were recognized by two populations of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in different trichoid sensilla on antennae of both species. The ratios of OSNs responding to Z11-16:Ald and Z9-16:Ald OSNs were 100:28.9 and 21.9:100 in H. armigera and H. assulta, respectively. The Z11-16:Ald OSNs in H. armigera exhibited higher sensitivity and efficacy than those in H. assulta, while the Z9-16:Ald OSNs in H. armigera had the same sensitivity but lower efficacy than those in H. assulta. At the dosage of 10 μg, Z11-16: Ald and Z9-16: Ald evoked calcium activity in 8.5% and 3.0% of the AL surface in H. armigera, while 5.4% and 8.6% of AL in H. assulta, respectively. The calcium activities in the AL reflected the peripheral input signals of the binary pheromone mixtures and correlated with the behavioral output. These results demonstrate that the binary pheromone blends were precisely coded by the firing frequency of individual OSNs tuned to Z11-16: Ald or Z9-16: Ald, as well as their population sizes. Such information was then accurately reported to ALs of H. armigera and H. assulta, eventually producing different behaviors. © 2013 Wu et al.},

abstract={Background:Free light chains (LCs) are among the many ligands that bind to cubilin/megalin for endocytosis via the clathrin-dependent endosomal/lysosomal pathway. Receptor associated protein (RAP), is a 39 kDA high-affinity, chaperone-like ligand for megalin that assists in the proper folding and functioning of megalin/cubilin. Although RAP is known to inhibit ligand binding to megalin/cubilin, its effect on LC endocytosis has not been shown directly.Methods and Principal Findings:We investigated whether RAP can block the endocytosis of LC in cultured human proximal tubule cells and whether this can prevent LC cytotoxicity. Immunofluorescence microscopy and flow cytometry showed that fluorescently labeled LC endocytosis was markedly inhibited in HK-2 cells pretreated with human RAP. The effect of RAP was dose-dependent, and was predominantly on endocytosis as it had no effect on the small acid-washable fraction of LC bound to cell membrane. RAP significantly inhibited LC induced cytokine production and phosphorylation of ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK. Prolonged exposure to LC for 48 h resulted in epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation in HK-2 cells as evidenced by marked reduction in the expression of the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin, and increased the expression of the mesenchymal marker α-SMA, which was also prevented by RAP in the endocytosis medium.Conclusions:RAP inhibited LC endocytosis by ∼88% and ameliorated LC-induced cytokine responses and EMT in human PTCs. The results not only provide additional evidence that LCs endocytosis occurs via the megalin/cubilin endocytic receptor system, but also show that blocking LC endocytosis by RAP can protect proximal tubule cells from LC cytotoxicity.},

abstract={Purified polysaccharide and conjugate vaccines are widely used for preventing infections in adults and in children against the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus pneumoniae, a pathogen responsible for high morbidity and mortality rates, especially in developing countries. However, these polysaccharide-based vaccines have some important limitations, such as being serotype-dependent, being subjected to losing efficacy because of serotype replacement and high manufacturing complexity and cost. It is expected that protein-based vaccines will overcome these issues by conferring a broad coverage independent of serotype and lowering production costs. In this study, we have applied the "shaving" proteomic approach, consisting of the LC/MS/MS analysis of peptides generated by protease treatment of live cells, to a collection of 16 pneumococcal clinical isolates from adults, representing the most prevalent strains circulating in Spain during the last years. The set of unique proteins identified in all the isolates, called "pan-surfome", consisted of 254 proteins, which included most of the protective protein antigens reported so far. In search of new candidates with vaccine potential, we identified 32 that were present in at least 50% of the clinical isolates analyzed. We selected four of them (Spr0012, Spr0328, Spr0561 and SP670_2141), whose protection capacity has not yet been tested, for assaying immunogenicity in human sera. All of them induced the production of IgM antibodies in infected patients, thus indicating that they could enter the pipeline for vaccine studies. The pan-surfomic approach shows its utility in the discovery of new proteins that can elicit protection against infectious microorganisms. © 2013 Olaya-Abril et al.},

abstract={In mammalian cells, the first line of defense against viral pathogens is the innate immune response, which is characterized by induction of type I interferons (IFN) and other pro-inflammatory cytokines that establish an antiviral milieu both in infected cells and in neighboring uninfected cells. Rotavirus, a double-stranded RNA virus of the Reoviridae family, is the primary etiological agent of severe diarrhea in young children worldwide. Previous studies demonstrated that rotavirus replication induces a MAVS-dependent type I IFN response that involves both RIG-I and MDA5, two cytoplasmic viral RNA sensors. This study reports the isolation and characterization of rotavirus RNAs that activate IFN signaling. Using an in vitro approach with purified rotavirus double-layer particles, nascent single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) transcripts (termed in vitro ssRNA) were found to be potent IFN inducers. In addition, large RNAs isolated from rotavirus-infected cells six hours post-infection (termed in vivo 6 hr large RNAs), also activated IFN signaling, whereas a comparable large RNA fraction isolated from cells infected for only one hour lacked this stimulatory activity. Experiments using knockout murine embryonic fibroblasts showed that RIG-I is required for and MDA5 partly contributes to innate immune signaling by both in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNAs. Enzymatic studies demonstrated that in vitro ssRNA and in vivo 6 hr large RNA samples contain uncapped RNAs with exposed 5' phosphate groups. RNAs lacking 2'-O-methylated 5' cap structures were also detected in the in vivo 6 hr large RNA sample. Taken together, our data provide strong evidence that the rotavirus VP3 enzyme, which encodes both guanylyltransferase and methyltransferase activities, is not completely efficient at either 5' capping or 2'-O-methylation of the 5' cap structures of viral transcripts, and in this way produces RNA patterns that activate innate immune signaling through the RIG-I-like receptors. © 2013 Uzri et al.},

abstract={Cognitive control is integral to the ability to attend to a relevant task whilst suppressing distracting information or inhibiting prepotent responses. The current study examined the development of these two subprocesses by examining electrophysiological indices elicited during each process. Thirteen 18 year-old adults and thirteen children aged 8-11 years (mean = 9.77 years) completed a hybrid Go/Nogo flanker task while continuous EEG data were recorded. The N2 topography for both response inhibition and interference suppression changed with increasing age. The neural activation associated with response inhibition became increasingly frontally distributed with age, and showed decreases of both amplitude and peak latency from childhood to adulthood, possibly due to reduced cognitive demands and myelination respectively occurring during this period. Interestingly, a significant N2 effect was apparent in adults, but not observed in children during trials requiring interference suppression. This could be due to more diffuse activation in children, which would require smaller levels of activation over a larger region of the brain than is reported in adults. Overall, these results provide evidence of distinct maturational processes occurring throughout late childhood and adolescence, highlighting the separability of response inhibition and interference suppression. © 2013 Brydges et al.},

abstract={Model-based prediction is dependent on many choices ranging from the sample collection and prediction endpoint to the choice of algorithm and its parameters. Here we studied the effects of such choices, exemplified by predicting sensitivity (as IC50) of cancer cell lines towards a variety of compounds. For this, we used three independent sample collections and applied several machine learning algorithms for predicting a variety of endpoints for drug response. We compared all possible models for combinations of sample collections, algorithm, drug, and labeling to an identically generated null model. The predictability of treatment effects varies among compounds, i.e. response could be predicted for some but not for all. The choice of sample collection plays a major role towards lowering the prediction error, as does sample size. However, we found that no algorithm was able to consistently outperform the other and there was no significant difference between regression and two- or three class predictors in this experimental setting. These results indicate that response-modeling projects should direct efforts mainly towards sample collection and data quality, rather than method adjustment. © 2013 Bayer et al.},

We compared plants growing in simple sand (control) with those growing in a substrate enriched with P. oceanica wrack (treatment) in laboratory. P. oceanica wrack doubled the N substrate pool and kept the substrate humid. Plants growing in the treated substrate grew faster, were twice as large as those growing in the control substrate, while tissues were enriched in N and P (Cakile by the 1.3 fold in N and 2.5 fold in P; Elymus by 1.5 fold in N and 2 fold in P).

However, the temporal profile by which OB somatostatin-expressing (Som+) interneurons are produced and the molecular mechanisms controlling this profile are totally unknown. In the present study, we found that all the Som+ interneurons in the mouse external plexiform layer (EPL) and the rat glomerular layer (GL) express the transcription factor Sp8.Using the 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) birth dating method, combined with immunostaining, we showed that the generation of Som+ interneurons in the mouse and rat OB is confined to the later embryonic and earlier postnatal stages. Within the mouse OB, the production of Som+ interneurons is maximal during late embryogenesis and decreases after birth, whereas the generation of Som+ interneurons is low during embryogenesis and increases gradually after birth in the rat OB. Interestingly, genetic ablation of Sp8 by cre/loxP-based recombination severely reduces the number of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. Taken together, these results suggest that Sp8 is required for the normal production of Som+ interneurons in the EPL of the mouse OB. © 2013 Jiang et al.},

abstract={This study examines the regulating effect of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) on the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in cerebral ischemia. By employing permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model, we find that Shh significantly decreases brain edema and preserves BBB permeability. Moreover, Shh increases zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1), occludin and angiopiotetin-1 (Ang-1) expression in the ischemic penumbra. Blockage of Shh with cyclopamine abolishes the effects of Shh on brain edema, BBB permeability and ZO-1, occludin, Ang-1 expression. Primary brain microvessel endothelial cells (BMECs) and astrocytes were pre-treated with Shh, cyclopamine, Ang-1-neutralizing antibody, and subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD). Results show that the Ang-1 protein level in the culture medium of Shh-treated astrocytes is significantly higher. Shh also increased ZO-1, occludin and Ang-1 expression in BMECs, while cyclopamine and Ang-1-neutralizing antibody inhibited the effects of Shh on the ZO-1 and occludin expression, respectively. This study suggests that, under ischemic insults, Shh triggers Ang-1 production predominantly in astrocytes, and the secreted Ang-1 acts on BMECs, thereby upregulating ZO-1 and occludin to repair the tight junction and ameliorate the brain edema and BBB leakage. © 2013 Xia et al.},

abstract={Cartilage defects resulting from traumatic injury or degenerative diseases have very limited spontaneous healing ability. Recent progress in tissue engineering and local therapeutic gene delivery systems has led to promising new strategies for successful regeneration of hyaline cartilage. In the present study, tissue engineering and local therapeutic gene delivery systems are combined with the design of a novel gene-activated matrix (GAM) embedded with hybrid hyaluronic acid(HA)/chitosan(CS)/plasmid-DNA nanoparticles encoding transforming growth factor (TGF)-β1. A chitosan scaffold functioned as the three-dimensional carrier for the nanoparticles. Results demonstrated that scaffold-entrapped plasmid DNA was released in a sustained and steady manner over 120 days, and was effectively protected in the HA/CS/pDNA nanoparticles. Culture results demonstrated that chondrocytes grown in the novel GAM were highly proliferative and capable of filling scaffold micropores with cells and extracellular matrix. Confocal laser scanning microscopy indicated that chondrocytes seeded in the GAM expressed exogenous transgenes labeled with green fluorescent protein. ELISA results demonstrated detectable TGF-β1 expression in the supernatant of GAM cultures, which peaked at the sixth day of culture and afterwards showed a moderate decline. Histological results and biochemical assays confirmed promotion of chondrocyte proliferation. Cell culture indicated no affects on phenotypic expression of ECM molecules, such as GAG. The results of this study indicate the suitability of this novel GAM for enhanced in vitro cartilage tissue engineering. © 2013 Lu et al.},

abstract={Background:Serum markers represent potential tools for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC). The aim of this study was to obtain proteomic expression profiles and identify serum markers for the early detection of CRC.Methods:Proteomic profiles of serum samples collected from 35 healthy volunteers, 35 patients with advanced colorectal adenoma (ACA), and 40 patients with CRC were compared using Clinprot technology. Using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), 366 sera samples were additionally analyzed, and immunohistochemistry studies of 400 tissues were used to verify the expression of kininogen-1 and its value in the early detection of CRC.Results:Predicting models were established among the three groups, and kininogen-1 was identified as a potential marker for CRC using Clinprot technology. ELISAs also detected significantly higher serum kininogen-1 levels in ACA and CRC patients compared to controls (P<0.05). Furthermore, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for serum kininogen-1 in the diagnosis of ACA was 0.635 (P = 0.003), and for serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) was 0.453 (P = 0.358). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of serum kininogen-1 for diagnosing Duke's stage A and B CRC was 70.13%, 65.88%, and 67.90%, respectively, whereas serum CEA was 38.96%, 85.88%, and 63.58%, respectively. Moreover, immunohistochemistry showed that expression of kininogen-1 was significantly higher in CRC and ACA tissues than in normal mucosa (48.39% vs. 15.58% vs. 0%, P<0.05).Conclusions:These results suggest that Clinprot technology provides a useful tool for the diagnosis of CRC, and kininogen-1 is a potential serum biomarker for the early detection of advanced colorectal adenoma and CRC. © 2013 Wang et al.},

abstract={Most of the morphological features recognized in hominin teeth, particularly the topography of the occlusal surface, are generally interpreted as an evolutionary functional adaptation for mechanical food processing. In this respect, we can also expect that the general architecture of a tooth reflects a response to withstand the high stresses produced during masticatory loadings. Here we use an engineering approach, finite element analysis (FEA), with an advanced loading concept derived from individual occlusal wear information to evaluate whether some dental traits usually found in hominin and extant great ape molars, such as the trigonid crest, the entoconid-hypoconulid crest and the protostylid have important biomechanical implications. For this purpose, FEA was applied to 3D digital models of three Gorilla gorilla lower second molars (M2) differing in wear stages. Our results show that in unworn and slightly worn M2s tensile stresses concentrate in the grooves of the occlusal surface. In such condition, the trigonid and the entoconid-hypoconulid crests act to reinforce the crown locally against stresses produced along the mesiodistal groove. Similarly, the protostylid is shaped like a buttress to suffer the high tensile stresses concentrated in the deep buccal groove. These dental traits are less functional in the worn M2, because tensile stresses decrease physiologically in the crown with progressing wear due to the enlargement of antagonistic contact areas and changes in loading direction from oblique to nearly parallel direction to the dental axis. This suggests that the wear process might have a crucial influence in the evolution and structural adaptation of molars enabling to endure bite stresses and reduce tooth failure throughout the lifetime of an individual. © 2013 Benazzi et al.},

abstract={Purpose:To assess the prevalence and causes of visual impairment in urban and rural population aged ≥40 years in the South India state of Andhra Pradesh.Methods:A population based cross-sectional study was conducted in which 7800 subjects were sampled from two rural and an urban locations. Visual Acuity (VA) was assessed using a tumbling E chart and eye examinations were performed by trained vision technicians. A questionnaire was used to collect personal and demographic information and previous consultation to eye care providers. Blindness and moderate Visual Impairment (VI) was defined as presenting VA <6/60 and <6/18 to 6/60 in the better eye respectively. VI included blindness and moderate VI.Results:Of the 7800 subjects enumerated, 7378 (94.6%) were examined. Among those examined, 46.4% were male and 61.8% of them had no education. The mean age of those examined (51.7 years; standard deviation 10.9 years) was similar to those not examined (52.8 years; standard deviation 9.9 years) (p = 0.048). Age and gender adjusted prevalence of VI was 14.3% (95% CI: 13.5-15.0). Refractive errors were the leading cause of VI accounting for 47.6% of all VI followed by cataract (43.7%). Together, they contributed to over 91.3% of the total VI. With multiple logistic regression, the odds of having VI increased significantly with increasing age. Those respondents who had no education were twice (95% CI: 1.7-2.5) more likely to have VI compared to those who were educated. VI was associated with rural residence (OR: 1.3; 95% CI: 1.1-1.6). The association between VI and gender was not statistically significant.Conclusions:The visual impairment remains a public health challenge in Andhra Pradesh, most of which can be addressed with relatively straight forward interventions like cataract surgery and spectacles. The eye care services need to be streamlined to address this challenge. © 2013 Marmamula et al.},

abstract={Mycolactones are polyketide-derived lipid virulence factors made by the slow-growing human pathogen, Mycobacterium ulcerans. Three unusually large and homologous plasmid-borne genes (mlsA1: 51 kb, mlsB: 42 kb and mlsA2: 7 kb) encode the mycolactone type I polyketide synthases (PKS). The extreme size and low sequence diversity of these genes has posed significant barriers for exploration of the genetic and biochemical basis of mycolactone synthesis. Here, we have developed a truncated, more tractable 3-module version of the 18-module mycolactone PKS and we show that this engineered PKS functions as expected in the natural host M. ulcerans to produce an additional polyketide; a triketide lactone (TKL). Cell fractionation experiments indicated that this 3-module PKS and the putative accessory enzymes encoded by mup045 and mup038 associated with the mycobacterial cell wall, a finding supported by confocal microscopy. We then assessed the capacity of the faster growing, Mycobacterium marinum to harbor and express the 3-module Mls PKS and accessory enzymes encoded by mup045 and mup038. RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and cell fractionation experiments confirmed that the truncated Mls PKS multienzymes were expressed and also partitioned with the cell wall material in M. marinum. However, this heterologous host failed to produce TKL. The systematic deconstruction of the mycolactone PKS presented here suggests that the Mls multienzymes are necessary but not sufficient for mycolactone synthesis and that synthesis is likely to occur (at least in part) within the mycobacterial cell wall. This research is also the first proof-of-principle demonstration of the potential of this enzyme complex to produce tailored small molecules through genetically engineered rearrangements of the Mls modules. © 2013 Porter et al.},

abstract={High-amplitude electric pulses of nanosecond duration, also known as nanosecond pulsed electric field (nsPEF), are a novel modality with promising applications for cell stimulation and tissue ablation. However, key mechanisms responsible for the cytotoxicity of nsPEF have not been established. We show that the principal cause of cell death induced by 60- or 300-ns pulses in U937 cells is the loss of the plasma membrane integrity ("nanoelectroporation"), leading to water uptake, cell swelling, and eventual membrane rupture. Most of this early necrotic death occurs within 1-2 hr after nsPEF exposure. The uptake of water is driven by the presence of pore-impermeable solutes inside the cell, and can be counterbalanced by the presence of a pore-impermeable solute such as sucrose in the medium. Sucrose blocks swelling and prevents the early necrotic death; however the long-term cell survival (24 and 48 hr) does not significantly change. Cells protected with sucrose demonstrate higher incidence of the delayed death (6-24 hr post nsPEF). These cells are more often positive for the uptake of an early apoptotic marker dye YO-PRO-1 while remaining impermeable to propidium iodide. Instead of swelling, these cells often develop apoptotic fragmentation of the cytoplasm. Caspase 3/7 activity increases already in 1 hr after nsPEF and poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage is detected in 2 hr. Staurosporin-treated positive control cells develop these apoptotic signs only in 3 and 4 hr, respectively. We conclude that nsPEF exposure triggers both necrotic and apoptotic pathways. The early necrotic death prevails under standard cell culture conditions, but cells rescued from the necrosis nonetheless die later on by apoptosis. The balance between the two modes of cell death can be controlled by enabling or blocking cell swelling. © 2013 Pakhomova et al.},

abstract={Chemical synaptic transmission involves the release of a neurotransmitter that diffuses in the extracellular space and interacts with specific receptors located on the postsynaptic membrane. Computer simulation approaches provide fundamental tools for exploring various aspects of the synaptic transmission under different conditions. In particular, Monte Carlo methods can track the stochastic movements of neurotransmitter molecules and their interactions with other discrete molecules, the receptors. However, these methods are computationally expensive, even when used with simplified models, preventing their use in large-scale and multi-scale simulations of complex neuronal systems that may involve large numbers of synaptic connections. We have developed a machine-learning based method that can accurately predict relevant aspects of the behavior of synapses, such as the percentage of open synaptic receptors as a function of time since the release of the neurotransmitter, with considerably lower computational cost compared with the conventional Monte Carlo alternative. The method is designed to learn patterns and general principles from a corpus of previously generated Monte Carlo simulations of synapses covering a wide range of structural and functional characteristics. These patterns are later used as a predictive model of the behavior of synapses under different conditions without the need for additional computationally expensive Monte Carlo simulations. This is performed in five stages: data sampling, fold creation, machine learning, validation and curve fitting. The resulting procedure is accurate, automatic, and it is general enough to predict synapse behavior under experimental conditions that are different to the ones it has been trained on. Since our method efficiently reproduces the results that can be obtained with Monte Carlo simulations at a considerably lower computational cost, it is suitable for the simulation of high numbers of synapses and it is therefore an excellent tool for multi-scale simulations. © 2013 Montes et al.},

abstract={The SGF29 protein binds to tri-methylated lysine-4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3), which is a histone modification associated with active promoters. Human SGF29 is a subunit of the histone acetyltransferase module of the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) and ATAC (Ada-Two-A-containing 2A) co-activator complexes. Previous work revealed that the SAGA complex is recruited to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress target genes and required for their induction. Here, we report the involvement of SGF29 in the survival of human cells from ER stress. SGF29 knockdown results in impaired transcription of the ER stress genes GRP78 and CHOP. Besides histone H3K14 acetylation, we find that SGF29 is also required for the maintenance of H3K4me3 at these genes, which is already present prior to ER stress. Reduced levels of H3K4me3 in the absence of SGF29 correlate with a decreased association of ASH2L, which is a core component of the SET1/MLL complexes, to GFP78 and CHOP. In conclusion, our results suggest that the H3K4me3-binding protein SGF29 plays a central and dual role in the ER stress response. Prior to ER stress, the protein coordinates H3K4me3 levels, thereby maintaining a 'poised' chromatin state on ER stress target gene promoters. Following ER stress induction, SGF29 is required for increased H3K14 acetylation on these genes, which then results in full transcriptional activation, thereby promoting cell survival. © 2013 Schram et al.},

abstract={Cryptococcus is an emerging global health threat that is annually responsible for over 1,000,000 infections and one third of all AIDS patient deaths. There is an ongoing outbreak of cryptococcosis in the western United States and Canada. Cryptococcosis is a disease resulting from the inhalation of the infectious propagules from the environment. The current and most frequently used animal infection models initiate infection via liquid suspension through intranasal instillation or intravenous injection. These models do not replicate the typically dry nature of aerosol exposure and may hinder our ability to decipher the initial events that lead to clearance or the establishment of infection. We have established a standardized aerosol model of murine infection for the human fungal pathogen Cryptococcus. Aerosolized cells were generated utilizing a Collison nebulizer in a whole-body Madison Chamber at different humidity conditions. The aerosols inside the chamber were sampled using a BioSampler to determine viable aerosol concentration and spray factor (ratio of viable aerosol concentration to total inoculum concentration). We have effectively delivered yeast and yeast-spore mixtures to the lungs of mice and observed the establishment of disease. We observed that growth conditions prior to exposure and humidity within the Madison Chamber during exposure can alter Cryptococcus survival and dose retained in mice. © 2013 Springer et al.},

abstract={Background:p16INK4a and p21WAF1 are two independent cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors encoded by the CDKN2A and CDKN1A genes, respectively. p16INK4a and p21WAF1 are similarly involved in various anti-cancer processes, including the regulation of the critical G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, senescence and apoptosis. Therefore, we sought to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the link between these two important tumor suppressor proteins.Methodology/Principal Findings:We have shown here that the p16INK4a protein positively controls the expression of p21WAF1 in both human and mouse cells. p16INK4a stabilizes the CDKN1A mRNA through negative regulation of the mRNA decay-promoting AUF1 protein. Immunoprecipitation of AUF1-associated RNAs followed by quantitative RT-PCR indicated that endogenous AUF1 binds to the CDKN1A mRNA in a p16INK4A-dependent manner. Furthermore, while AUF1 down-regulation increased the expression level of the CDKN1A mRNA, the concurrent knockdown of AUF1 and CDKN2A, using specific silencing RNAs, restored the normal expression of the gene. Moreover, we used EGFP reporter fused to the CDKN2A AU-rich element (ARE) to demonstrate that p16INK4A regulation of the CDKN1A mRNA is AUF1- and ARE-dependent. Furthermore, ectopic expression of p16INK4A in p16INK4A-deficient breast epithelial MCF-10A cells significantly increased the level of p21WAF1, with no effect on cell proliferation. In addition, we have shown direct correlation between p16INK4a and p21WAF1 levels in various cancer cell lines.Conclusion/Significance:These findings show that p16INK4a stabilizes the CDKN1A mRNA in an AUF1-dependent manner, and further confirm the presence of a direct link between the 2 important cancer-related pathways, pRB/p16INK4A and p14ARF/p53/p21WAF1. © 2013 Al-Khalaf et al.},

abstract={Artificial reefs are increasingly used worldwide as a method for managing recreational diving since they have the potential to satisfy both conservation goals and economic interests. In order to help maximize their utility, further information is needed to drive the design of stimulating resources for scuba divers. We used a questionnaire survey to explore divers' perceptions of artificial reefs in Barbados. In addition, we examined reef resource substitution behaviour among scuba divers. Divers expressed a clear preference for large shipwrecks or sunken vessels that provided a themed diving experience. Motives for diving on artificial reefs were varied, but were dominated by the chance of viewing concentrated marine life, increased photographic opportunities, and the guarantee of a 'good dive'. Satisfaction with artificial reef diving was high amongst novices and declined with increasing experience. Experienced divers had an overwhelming preference for natural reefs. As a management strategy, our results emphasize the capacity of well designed artificial reefs to contribute towards the management of coral reef diving sites and highlight a number of important areas for future research. Suggested work should validate the present findings in different marine tourism settings and ascertain support of artificial reefs in relationship to level of diver specialization. © 2013 Kirkbride-Smith et al.},

abstract={Shiga toxin 2 (Stx2)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) that can lead to fatal encephalopathies. Neurological abnormalities may occur before or after the onset of systemic pathological symptoms and motor disorders are frequently observed in affected patients and in studies with animal models. As Stx2 succeeds in crossing the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and invading the brain parenchyma, it is highly probable that the observed neurological alterations are based on the possibility that the toxin may trigger the impairment of the neurovascular unit and/or cell damage in the parenchyma. Also, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) produced and secreted by enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) may aggravate the deleterious effects of Stx2 in the brain. Therefore, this study aimed to determine (i) whether Stx2 affects the neurovascular unit and parenchymal cells, (ii) whether the contribution of LPS aggravates these effects, and (iii) whether an inflammatory event underlies the pathophysiological mechanisms that lead to the observed injury. The administration of a sub-lethal dose of Stx2 was employed to study in detail the motor cortex obtained from a translational murine model of encephalopathy. In the present paper we report that Stx2 damaged microvasculature, caused astrocyte reaction and neuronal degeneration, and that this was aggravated by LPS. Dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory, reversed the pathologic effects and proved to be an important drug in the treatment of acute encephalopathies. © 2013 Pinto et al.},

abstract={Aphanomyces astaci, the crayfish plague pathogen, first appeared in Europe in the mid-19th century and is still responsible for mass mortalities of native European crayfish. The spread of this parasite across the continent is especially facilitated by invasive North American crayfish species that serve as its reservoir.

It shares similar habitats as the native white-clawed crayfish Austropotamobius pallipes and, when infected, the signal crayfish might therefore easily transmit the pathogen to the native species. We investigated the prevalence of A. astaci in French signal crayfish populations to evaluate the danger they represent to local populations of native crayfish. Over 500 individuals of Pacifastacus leniusculus from 45 French populations were analysed, plus several additional individuals of other non-indigenous crayfish species Orconectes limosus, O. immunis and Procambarus clarkii. Altogether, 20% of analysed signal crayfish tested positive for Aphanomyces astaci, and the pathogen was detected in more than half of the studied populations. Local prevalence varied significantly, ranging from 0% up to 80%, but wide confidence intervals suggest that the number of populations infected by A. astaci may be even higher than our results show. Analysis of several individuals of other introduced species revealed infections among two of these, O. immunis and P. clarkii. Our results confirm that the widespread signal crayfish serves as a key reservoir of Aphanomyces astaci in France and therefore represents a serious danger to native crayfish species, especially the white-clawed crayfish. The prevalence in other non-indigenous crayfish should also be investigated as they likely contribute to pathogen transmission in the country. © 2013 Filipová et al.},

abstract={Smad7 has been shown to negatively regulate fibrosis and inflammation, but its role in angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced hypertensive cardiac remodeling remains unknown. Therefore, the present study investigated the role of Smad7 in hypertensive cardiopathy induced by angiotensin II infusion. Hypertensive cardiac disease was induced in Smad7 gene knockout (KO) and wild-type (WT) mice by subcutaneous infusion of Ang II (1.46 mg/kg/day) for 28 days. Although equal levels of high blood pressure were developed in both Smad7 KO and WT mice, Smad7 KO mice developed more severe cardiac injury as demonstrated by impairing cardiac function including a significant increase in left ventricular (LV) mass (P&lt;0.01),reduction of LV ejection fraction(P&lt;0.001) and fractional shortening(P&lt;0.001). Real-time PCR, Western blot and immunohistochemistry detected that deletion of Smad7 significantly enhanced Ang II-induced cardiac fibrosis and inflammation, including upregulation of collagen I, α-SMA, interleukin-1β, TNF-α, and infiltration of CD3+ T cells and F4/80+ macrophages. Further studies revealed that enhanced activation of the Sp1-TGFβ/Smad3-NF-κB pathways and downregulation of miR-29 were mechanisms though which deletion of Smad7 promoted Ang II-mediated cardiac remodeling. In conclusions, Smad7 plays a protective role in AngII-mediated cardiac remodeling via mechanisms involving the Sp1-TGF-β/Smad3-NF.κB-miR-29 regulatory network. © 2013 Wei et al.},

abstract={Background:Clonogenicity gives important information about the cellular reproductive potential following ionizing irradiation, but an abortive colony that fails to continue to grow remains poorly characterized. It was recently reported that the fraction of abortive colonies increases with increasing dose. Thus, we set out to investigate the production kinetics of abortive colonies using a model of branching processes.Methodology/Principal Findings:We firstly plotted the experimentally determined colony size distribution of abortive colonies in irradiated normal human fibroblasts, and found the linear relationship on the log-linear or log-log plot. By applying the simple model of branching processes to the linear relationship, we found the persistent reproductive cell death (RCD) over several generations following irradiation. To verify the estimated probability of RCD, abortive colony size distribution (≤15 cells) and the surviving fraction were simulated by the Monte Carlo computational approach for colony expansion. Parameters estimated from the log-log fit demonstrated the good performance in both simulations than those from the log-linear fit. Radiation-induced RCD, i.e. excess probability, lasted over 16 generations and mainly consisted of two components in the early (<3 generations) and late phases. Intriguingly, the survival curve was sensitive to the excess probability over 5 generations, whereas abortive colony size distribution was robust against it. These results suggest that, whereas short-term RCD is critical to the abortive colony size distribution, long-lasting RCD is important for the dose response of the surviving fraction.Conclusions/Significance:Our present model provides a single framework for understanding the behavior of primary cell colonies in culture following irradiation. © 2013 Sakashita et al.},

abstract={Background:Rickettsia heilongjiangensis, the agent of Far-Eastern spotted fever (FESF), is an obligate intracellular bacterium. The surface-exposed proteins (SEPs) of rickettsiae are involved in rickettsial adherence to and invasion of host cells, intracellular bacterial growth, and/or interaction with immune cells. They are also potential molecular candidates for the development of diagnostic reagents and vaccines against rickettsiosis.Methods:R. heilongjiangensis SEPs were identified by biotin-streptavidin affinity purification and 2D electrophoreses coupled with ESI-MS/MS. Recombinant SEPs were probed with various sera to analyze their serological characteristics using a protein microarray and an enzyme-linked immune sorbent assay (ELISA).Results:Twenty-five SEPs were identified, most of which were predicted to reside on the surface of R. heilongjiangensis cells. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that these proteins could be involved in bacterial pathogenesis. Eleven of the 25 SEPs were recognized as major seroreactive antigens by sera from R. heilongjiangensis-infected mice and FESF patients. Among the major seroreactive SEPs, microarray assays and/or ELISAs revealed that GroEL, OmpA-2, OmpB-3, PrsA, RplY, RpsB, SurA and YbgF had modest sensitivity and specificity for recognizing R. heilongjiangensis infection and/or spotted fever.Conclusions:Many of the SEPs identified herein have potentially important roles in R. heilongjiangensis pathogenicity. Some of them have potential as serodiagnostic antigens or as subunit vaccine antigens against the disease. © 2013 Qi et al.},

abstract={Proteins, widely studied as potential biomarkers, play important roles in numerous physiological functions and diseases. Genetic variation may modulate corresponding protein levels and point to the role of these variants in disease pathophysiology. Effects of individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within a gene were analyzed for corresponding plasma protein levels using genome-wide association study (GWAS) genotype data and proteomic panel data with 132 quality-controlled analytes from 521 Caucasian participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. Linear regression analysis detected 112 significant (Bonferroni threshold p = 2.44×10-5) associations between 27 analytes and 112 SNPs. 107 out of these 112 associations were tested in the Indiana Memory and Aging Study (IMAS) cohort for replication and 50 associations were replicated at uncorrected p&lt;0.05 in the same direction of effect as those in the ADNI. We identified multiple novel associations including the association of rs7517126 with plasma complement factor H-related protein 1 (CFHR1) level at p&lt;1.46×10-60, accounting for 40 percent of total variation of the protein level. We serendipitously found the association of rs6677604 with the same protein at p&lt;9.29×10-112. Although these two SNPs were not in the strong linkage disequilibrium, 61 percent of total variation of CFHR1 was accounted for by rs6677604 without additional variation by rs7517126 when both SNPs were tested together. 78 other SNP-protein associations in the ADNI sample exceeded genome-wide significance (5×10-8). Our results confirmed previously identified gene-protein associations for interleukin-6 receptor, chemokine CC-4, angiotensin-converting enzyme, and angiotensinogen, although the direction of effect was reversed in some cases. This study is among the first analyses of gene-protein product relationships integrating multiplex-panel proteomics and targeted genes extracted from a GWAS array. With intensive searches taking place for proteomic biomarkers for many diseases, the role of genetic variation takes on new importance and should be considered in interpretation of proteomic results. © 2013 Kim et al.},

abstract={Live animal trade is considered a major mode of introduction of viruses from enzootic foci into disease-free areas. Due to societal and behavioural changes, some wild animal species may nowadays be considered as pet species. The species diversity of animals involved in international trade is thus increasing. This could benefit pathogens that have a broad host range such as arboviruses. The objective of this study was to analyze the risk posed by live animal imports for the introduction, in the European Union (EU), of four arboviruses that affect human and horses: Eastern and Western equine encephalomyelitis, Venezuelan equine encephalitis and Japanese encephalitis. Importation data for a five-years period (2005-2009, extracted from the EU TRACES database), environmental data (used as a proxy for the presence of vectors) and horses and human population density data (impacting the occurrence of clinical cases) were combined to derive spatially explicit risk indicators for virus introduction and for the potential consequences of such introductions. Results showed the existence of hotspots where the introduction risk was the highest in Belgium, in the Netherlands and in the north of Italy. This risk was higher for Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) than for the three other diseases. It was mainly attributed to exotic pet species such as rodents, reptiles or cage birds, imported in small-sized containments from a wide variety of geographic origins. The increasing species and origin diversity of these animals may have in the future a strong impact on the risk of introduction of arboviruses in the EU. © 2013 Durand et al.},

abstract={A major hindrance to the study of honey bee pathogens or the effects of pesticides and nutritional deficiencies is the lack of controlled in vitro culture systems comprised of honey bee cells. Such systems are important to determine the impact of these stress factors on the developmental and cell biology of honey bees. We have developed a method incorporating established insect cell culture techniques that supports sustained growth of honey bee cells in vitro. We used honey bee eggs mid to late in their embryogenesis to establish primary cultures, as these eggs contain cells that are progressively dividing. Primary cultures were initiated in modified Leibovitz's L15 medium and incubated at 32°C. Serial transfer of material from several primary cultures was maintained and has led to the isolation of young cell lines. A cell line (AmE-711) has been established that is composed mainly of fibroblast-type cells that form an adherent monolayer. Most cells in the line are diploid (2n = 32) and have the Apis mellifera karyotype as revealed by Giemsa stain. The partial sequence for the mitochondrial-encoded cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (Cox 1) gene in the cell line is identical to those from honey bee tissues and a consensus sequence for A. mellifera. The population doubling time is approximately 4 days. Importantly, the cell line is continuously subcultured every 10-14 days when split at a 1:3 ratio and is cryopreserved in liquid nitrogen. The cell culture system we have developed has potential application for studies aimed at honey bee development, genetics, pathogenesis, transgenesis, and toxicology. © 2013 Goblirsch et al.},

Patients with newly detected HCV infections (n = 11,264) were classified based on treatment and clinical outcomes. IBTs were defined as regimens that included interferon- alfa, pegylated interferon- alfa -2a, or pegylated interferon- alfa -2b for at least 3 months. The Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and associated confidence interval (CI) of HCC and cirrhosis-associated complications for IBT.Results:The 8-year incidence rate for HCC was 3.9% among patients who received IBT and 5.6% among those who did not. The HCC-free survival rate was significantly higher among patients receiving IBT during the 8-year period than their counterpart (adjusted HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.81; P =. 004). Similarly, the event-free survival rates for esophageal variceal bleeding (adjusted HR, 0.45; 95% CI, 0.22-0.91; P =. 026), hepatic encephalopathy (adjusted HR, 0.38; 95% CI, 0.21-0.69; P =. 001), ascites (adjusted HR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.14-0.57; P<.001), and cirrhosis (adjusted HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.44-0.91; P =. 013) were significantly higher among patients who received IBT than those who did not, after adjustment for associated factors.Conclusion:Treatment with interferon may reduce the 8-year risk of HCC and cirrhosis-associated complications in patients with chronic HCV infection. © 2013 Hsu et al.},

abstract={Healthy corneal endothelium is essential for maintaining corneal clarity, as the damage of corneal endothelial cells and loss of cell count causes severe visual impairment. Corneal transplantation is currently the only therapy for severe corneal disorders. The greatly limited proliferative ability of human corneal endothelial cells (HCECs), even in vitro, has challenged researchers to establish efficient techniques for the cultivating HCECs, a pivotal issue for clinical applications. The aim of this study was to evaluate conditioned medium (CM) obtained from human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) (MSC-CM) for use as a consistent expansion protocol of HCECs. When HCECs were maintained in the presence of MSC-CM, cell morphology assumed a hexagonal shape similar to corneal endothelial cells in vivo, as opposed to the irregular cell shape observed in control cultures in the absence of MSC-CM. They also maintained the functional protein phenotypes; ZO-1 and Na+/K+-ATPase were localized at the intercellular adherent junctions and pump proteins of corneal endothelium were accordingly expressed. In comparison to the proliferative potential observed in the control cultures, HCECs maintained in MSC-CM were found to have more than twice as many Ki67-positive cells and a greatly increased incorporation of BrdU into DNA. MSC-CM further facilitated the cell migration of HCECs. Lastly, the mechanism of cell proliferation mediated by MSC-CM was investigated, and phosphorylation of Akt and ERK1/2 was observed in HCECs after exposure to MSC-CM. The inhibitor to PI 3-kinase maintained the level of p27Kip1 for up to 24 hours and greatly blocked the expression of cyclin D1 and D3 during the early G1 phase, leading to the reduction of cell density. These findings indicate that MSC-CM not only stimulates the proliferation of HCECs by regulating the G1 proteins of the cell cycle but also maintains the characteristic differentiated phenotypes necessary for the endothelial functions. © 2013 Nakahara et al.},

abstract={We have recently developed a high-density photolithographic, peptide array technology with a theoretical upper limit of 2 million different peptides per array of 2 cm2. Here, we have used this to perform complete and exhaustive analyses of linear B cell epitopes of a medium sized protein target using human serum albumin (HSA) as an example. All possible overlapping 15-mers from HSA were synthesized and probed with a commercially available polyclonal rabbit anti-HSA antibody preparation. To allow for identification of even the weakest epitopes and at the same time perform a detailed characterization of key residues involved in antibody binding, the array also included complete single substitution scans (i.e. including each of the 20 common amino acids) at each position of each 15-mer peptide. As specificity controls, all possible 15-mer peptides from bovine serum albumin (BSA) and from rabbit serum albumin (RSA) were included as well. The resulting layout contained more than 200.000 peptide fields and could be synthesized in a single array on a microscope slide. More than 20 linear epitope candidates were identified and characterized at high resolution i.e. identifying which amino acids in which positions were needed, or not needed, for antibody interaction. As expected, moderate cross-reaction with some peptides in BSA was identified whereas no cross-reaction was observed with peptides from RSA. We conclude that high-density peptide microarrays are a very powerful methodology to identify and characterize linear antibody epitopes, and should advance detailed description of individual specificities at the single antibody level as well as serologic analysis at the proteome-wide level. © 2013 Hansen et al.},

abstract={Background:Sugarcane mosaic virus (SCMV) is an important virus pathogen in crop production, causing serious losses in grain and forage yields in susceptible cultivars. Control strategies have been developed, but only marginal successes have been achieved. For the efficient control of this virus, a better understanding of its interactions and associated resistance mechanisms at the molecular level is required.Methodology/Principal Findings:The responses of resistant and susceptible genotypes of maize to SCMV and the molecular basis of the resistance were studied using a proteomic approach based on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS/MS) analysis. Ninety-six protein spots showed statistically significant differences in intensity after SCMV inoculation. The classification of differentially expressed proteins showed that SCMV-responsive proteins were mainly involved in energy and metabolism, stress and defense responses, and photosynthesis. Most of the proteins identified were located in chloroplasts, chloroplast membranes, and the cytoplasm. Analysis of changes in phytohormone levels after virus inoculation suggested that salicylic acid, abscisic acid, jasmonic acid, and azelaic acid may played important roles in the maize response to SCMV infection.Conclusions/Significance:Among these identified proteins, 19 have not been identified previously as virus-responsive proteins, and seven were new and did not have assigned functions. These proteins may be candidate proteins for future investigation, and they may present new biological functions and play important roles in plant-virus interactions. The behavioural patterns of the identified proteins suggest the existence of defense mechanisms operating during the early stages of infection that differed in two genotypes. In addition, there are overlapping and specific phytohormone responses to SCMV infection between resistant and susceptible maize genotypes. This study may provide important insights into the molecular events during plant responses to virus infection. © 2013 Wu et al.},

abstract={Valid screening devices are critical for an early diagnosis of dementia. The DemTect is such an internationally accepted tool. We aimed to characterize the neural networks associated with performance on the DemTect's subtests in two frequent dementia syndromes: early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Voxel-based group comparisons of cerebral glucose utilization (as measured by F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and gray matter atrophy (as measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging) were performed on data from 48 subjects with AD (n = 21), FTLD (n = 14) or subjective cognitive impairment (n = 13) as a control group. We performed group comparisons and correlation analyses between multimodal imaging data and performance on the DemTect's subtests. Group comparisons showed regional patterns consistent with previous findings for AD and FTLD. Interestingly, atrophy dominated in FTLD, whereas hypometabolism in AD. Across diagnostic groups performance on the "wordlist" subtest was positively correlated with glucose metabolism in the left temporal lobe. The "number transcoding" subtest was significantly associated with glucose metabolism in both a predominantly left lateralized frontotemporal network and a parietooccipital network including parts of the basal ganglia. Moreover, this subtest was associated with gray matter density in an extensive network including frontal, temporal, parietal and occipital areas. No significant correlates were observed for the "supermarket task" subtest. Scores on the "digit span reverse" subtest correlated with glucose metabolism in the left frontal cortex, the bilateral putamen, the head of caudate nucleus and the anterior insula. Disease-specific correlation analyses could partly verify or extend the correlates shown in the analyses across diagnostic groups. Correlates of gray matter density were found in FTLD for the "number transcoding" subtest and the "digit span reverse" subtest. Correlates of glucose metabolism were found in AD for the "wordlist" subtest and in FTLD for the "digit span reverse" subtest. Our study contributes to the understanding of the neural correlates of cognitive deficits in AD and FTLD and supports an external validation of the DemTect providing preliminary conclusions about disease-specific correlates. © 2013 The Authors.},

abstract={Emotional changes are common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intrinsic connectivity imaging studies suggest that default mode network degradation in AD is accompanied by the release of an emotion-relevant salience network. We investigated whether emotional contagion, an evolutionarily conserved affect-sharing mechanism, is higher in MCI and AD secondary to biological alterations in neural networks that support emotion. We measured emotional contagion in 237 participants (111 healthy controls, 62 patients with MCI, and 64 patients with AD) with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index Personal Distress subscale. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Geriatric Depression Scale. Participants underwent structural MRI, and voxel-based morphometry was used to relate whole-brain maps to emotional contagion. Analyses of covariance found significantly higher emotional contagion at each stage of disease progression [controls &lt; MCI (P &lt; 0.01) and MCI &lt; AD (P &lt; 0.001)]. Depressive symptoms were also higher in patients compared with controls [controls &lt; MCI (P &lt; 0.01) and controls &lt; AD (P &lt; 0.0001)]. Higher emotional contagion (but not depressive symptoms) was associated with smaller volume in right inferior, middle, and superior temporal gyri (PFWE &lt; 0.05); right temporal pole, anterior hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus; and left middle temporal gyrus (all P &lt; 0.001, uncorrected). These findings suggest that in MCI and AD, neurodegeneration of temporal lobe structures important for affective signal detection and emotion inhibition are associated with up-regulation of emotion-generating mechanisms. Emotional contagion, a quantifiable index of empathic reactivity that is present in other species, may be a useful tool with which to study emotional alterations in animal models of AD.},

abstract={Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from structural Magnetic Resonance (MR) images is difficult due to the complex alteration of patterns in brain anatomy that could indicate the presence or absence of the pathology. Currently, an effective approach that allows to interpret the disease in terms of global and local changes is not available in the clinical practice. In this paper, we propose an approach for classification of brain MR images, based on finding pathology-related patterns through the identification of regional structural changes. The approach combines a probabilistic Latent Semantic Analysis (pLSA) technique, which allows to identify image regions through latent topics inferred from the brain MR slices, with a bottom-up Graph-Based Visual Saliency (GBVS) model, which calculates maps of relevant information per region. Regional saliency maps are finally combined into a single map on each slice, obtaining a master saliency map of each brain volume. The proposed approach includes a one-to-one comparison of the saliency maps which feeds a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, to group test subjects into normal or probable AD subjects. A set of 156 brain MR images from healthy (76) and pathological (80) subjects, splitted into a training set (10 non-demented and 10 demented subjects) and one testing set (136 subjects), was used to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. Preliminary results show that the proposed method reaches a maximum classification accuracy of 87.21% © 2013 SPIE.},

abstract={Neurons are anatomically and physiologically connected to each other, and these connections are involved in various neuronal functions. Multiple important neural networks involved in neurodegenerative diseases can be detected using network analyses in functional neuroimaging. First, the basic methods and theories of voxel-based network analyses, such as principal component analysis, independent component analysis, and seed-based analysis, are described. Disease- and symptom-specific brain networks have been identified using glucose metabolism images in patients with Parkinson's disease. These networks enable us to objectively evaluate individual patients and serve as diagnostic tools as well as biomarkers for therapeutic interventions. Many functional MRI studies have shown that "hub" brain regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, are deactivated by externally driven cognitive tasks; such brain regions form the "default mode network." Recent studies have shown that this default mode network is disrupted from the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease and is associated with amyloid deposition in the brain. Some recent studies have shown that the default mode network is also impaired in Parkinson's disease, whereas other studies have shown inconsistent results. These incongruent results could be due to the heterogeneous pharmacological status, differences in mesocortical dopaminergic impairment status, and concomitant amyloid deposition. Future neuroimaging network analysis studies will reveal novel and interesting findings that will uncover the pathomechanisms of neurological and psychiatric disorders.},

abstract={Neural networks supporting memory function decline with increasing age. Accumulation of amyloid-β, a histopathological finding in Alzheimer's disease, is a likely contributor. Posteromedial cortices (PMCs) are particularly vulnerable to early amyloid pathology and play a role in both encoding and retrieval processes. The extent to which aging and amyloid influence the ability to modulate activity between these processes within the PMC was investigated by combining positron emission tomography-amyloid imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging in cognitively normal older and young adults. Young subjects exhibited a marked decrease in activity during encoding and an increase during retrieval (also known as encoding/retrieval "flip"). Impaired ability to modulate activity was associated with increasing age, greater amyloid burden, and worse memory performance. In contrast, the hippocampus showed increased activity during both encoding and retrieval, which was not related to these variables. These findings support a specific link between amyloid pathology and neural dysfunction in PMC and elucidate the underpinnings of age-related memory dysfunction. © 2012 The Author.},

abstract={This project aimed to investigate the metabolic basis for resilience to neurodegeneration (cognitive reserve) in highly educated patients with prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: Sixty-four patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment who later converted to AD dementia during follow-up, and 90 controls, underwent brain 18F-FDG PET. Both groups were divided into a poorly educated subgroup (42 controls and 36 prodromal AD patients) and a highly educated subgroup (48 controls and 28 prodromal AD patients). Brain metabolism was first compared between education-matched groups of patients and controls. Then, metabolism was compared between highly and poorly educated prodromal AD patients in both directions to identify regions of high education-related metabolic depression and compensation. The clusters of significant depression and compensation were further used as volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) in a brain interregional correlation analysis in each prodromal AD subgroup to explore metabolic connectivity. All analyses were performed by means of SPM8 (P &lt; 0.001 uncorrected at peak level, P &lt; 0.05 false discovery rate-corrected at cluster level; age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and center as nuisance). Results: Highly educated prodromal AD patients showed more severe hypometabolism than poorly educated prodromal AD patients in the left inferior and middle temporal gyri and the left middle occipital gyrus (ROI depression). Conversely, they showed relative hypermetabolism in the right inferior, middle, and superior frontal gyri (ROI compensation). The sites of compensation, mainly corresponding to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC), showed wide metabolic correlations with several cortical areas in both hemispheres (frontotemporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus) in highly educated prodromal AD patients but not in poorly educated prodromal AD patients. To provide evidence on whether these metabolic correlations represent preservation of the physiologic networks of highly educated control subjects (neural reserve) or rather the recruitment of alternative networks (neural compensation), or a combination of the two, we performed metabolic connectivity analysis of the DLFC in highly educated controls as well. The correlation sites of right DLFC partly overlapped those of highly educated prodromal AD patients but were less extended. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that highly educated prodromal AD patients can cope better with the disease thanks to neural reserve but also to the recruitment of compensatory neural networks in which the right DLFC plays a key role.

abstract={Automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) processing pipelines and different multivariate techniques are gaining popularity for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. We used four supervised learning methods to classify AD patients and controls (CTL) and to prospectively predict the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD from baseline MRI data. A total of 345 participants from the AddNeuroMed cohort were included in this study; 116 AD patients, 119 MCI patients and 110 CTL individuals. High resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets were acquired and MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer. We explored the classification ability of orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS), decision trees (Trees), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Applying 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated that SVM and OPLS were slightly superior to Trees and ANN, although not statistically significant for distinguishing between AD and CTL. The classification experiments resulted in up to 83% sensitivity and 87% specificity for the best techniques. For the prediction of conversion of MCI patients at baseline to AD at 1-year follow-up, we obtained an accuracy of up to 86%. The value of the multivariate models derived from the classification of AD vs. CTL was shown to be robust and efficient in the identification of MCI converters. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

abstract={Background: The functional neural network model has been a major method used to investigate mechanisms of neuropsychopathy. There is considerable evidence that late-onset depression (LOD) is the prodrome, or the early clinical manifestation, of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The default mode network (DMN) is one of the neural networks that can be used to explore the complex relationships between depressive symptoms, episodic memory deficits and other cognitive impairments. To date, no study has directly linked the DMN to LOD while focusing on episodic memory and the influence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for AD in LOD patients. Methods: In total, 33 remitted LOD (rLOD) patients and 33 elderly controls underwent fMRI scanning using low-frequency BOLD signal imaging during the resting state and during an episodic memory task. Furthermore, function-based functional connectivities (FCs) in the region of interesting (ROI) (posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the DMN) were analysed to explore interactions between disease states, task states and genetic risk factors (APOE4). Results: Compared to healthy control subjects (HC), the FCs between the PCC and the right medial temporal lobe of the rLOD patients were significantly stronger during rest (p<0.005) and significantly weaker (p<0.05) during performance of the task. The mode of change from rest to task performance in the HC was in contrast to the mode of change in the rLOD patients. The FCs of the rLOD patients without APOE4 were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the resting state, but the rLOD patients who carried APOE4 showed a trend toward decreased FCs. Limitations: The sample size was small. While the study was cross-sectional, we did not differentiate between the various types of antidepressants the patients used, which may have had different effects on cognitive function, especially on episodic memory. Conclusion: Our results suggested that rLOD might be the prodrome, or the early clinical manifestation, of AD and that rLOD patients with APOE4 showed an increased risk for episodic memory decline and AD. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Approximately 75% of traumatic brain injuries (TBI) are classified mild (mTBI). Despite the high frequency of mTBI, it is the least well studied. The prevalence of mTBI among service personnel returning from Operations Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Enduring Freedom (OEF) and the recent reports of an association between repeated mTBI and the early onset of Alzheimer's and other types of dementias in retired athletes has focused much attention on mTBI. The study of mTBI requires the development and validation of experimental models and one of the most basic requirements for an experimental model is that it replicates important features of the injury or disease in humans. mTBI in humans is associated with acute symptoms such as loss of consciousness and pre- and/or posttraumatic amnesia. In addition, many mTBI patients experience long-term effects of mTBI, including deficits in speed of information processing, attention and concentration, memory acquisition, retention and retrieval, and reasoning and decision-making. Although methods for the diagnosis and evaluation of the acute and chronic effects of mTBI in humans are well established, the same is not the case for rodents, the most widely used animal for TBI studies. Despite the magnitude of the difficulties associated with adapting these methods for experimental mTBI research, they must be surmounted. The identification and testing of treatments for mTBI depends of the development, characterization and validation of reproducible, clinically relevant models of mTBI. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.},

abstract={Amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice modeling Alzheimer's disease display frequent occurrence of seizures peaking at an age when amyloid plaques start to form in the cortex and hippocampus. We tested the hypothesis that numerous reported interactions of amyloid-β with cell surface molecules result in altered excitation-inhibition balance in brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. We examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus during movement, quiet waking, non-rapid eye movement sleep, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Cortical EEG power was higher in APdE9 mice than in WT mice over a broad frequency range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4 behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also increased but in a narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed augmented cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta-gamma modulation were preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of theta-gamma modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early stage of amyloid pathology, cortical principal cells become hyperexcitable and via extensive cortico-thalamic connection drive thalamic cells. Minor hippocampal changes are most likely secondary to abnormal entorhinal input. © 2013 The Author.},

abstract={The medial temporal lobes (MTL) and frontal cortex have been shown to subserve memory processes. Neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), disrupt the neuronal networks that underlie memory processing. The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is a genetic risk factor for AD and is associated with decrements in memory and in olfactory function. The present study utilized EQS, a structural equation modeling software program, to examine differences in the neuronal networks between non-demented ε4 carriers and ε4 noncarriers during a cross-modal olfactory recognition memory paradigm. Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were presented with 16 odors. During two scans, participants discriminated between names of odors presented before scanning (targets) or not presented (foils). The results indicate significant connections between bilateral frontal lobes and MTL for ε4 carriers when they misidentified a foil as a target. When ε4 noncarriers correctly identified a target, there were greater associations between the amygdala, MTL, and right frontal lobe; these associations also modeled the brain's response when ε4 noncarriers misidentified a foil as a target. During memory retrieval, affective cues may facilitate retrieval in ε4 noncarriers relative to ε4 carriers. Last, no model was found that best represented the functional network used by ε4 carriers when they correctly identified a target, which may reflect variability of neuronal recruitment within this population.

abstract={Patients with Alzheimer's disease have category-specific semantic memory difficulty for natural relative to manufactured objects. We assessed the basis for this deficit by asking healthy adults and patients to judge whether pairs of words share a feature (e.g. "banana:lemon-COLOR"). In an fMRI study, healthy adults showed gray matter (GM) activation of temporal-occipital cortex (TOC) where visual-perceptual features may be represented, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) which may contribute to feature selection. Tractography revealed dorsal and ventral stream white matter (WM) projections between PFC and TOC. Patients had greater difficulty with natural than manufactured objects. This was associated with greater overlap between diseased GM areas correlated with natural kinds in patients and fMRI activation in healthy adults for natural kinds. The dorsal WM projection between PFC and TOC in patients correlated only with judgments of natural kinds. Patients thus remained dependent on the same neural network as controls during judgments of natural kinds, despite disease in these areas. For manufactured objects, patients' judgments showed limited correlations with PFC and TOC GM areas activated by controls, and did not correlate with the PFC-TOC dorsal WM tract. Regions outside of the PFC-TOC network thus may help support patients' judgments of manufactured objects. We conclude that a large-scale neural network for semantic memory implicates both feature knowledge representations in modality-specific association cortex and heteromodal regions important for accessing this knowledge, and that patients' relative deficit for natural kinds is due in part to their dependence on this network despite disease in these areas. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract={Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is one of the key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neither traditional clinical-pathological studies nor modern in vivo biomarker investigations of brain amyloid load, however, could reveal a convincing relationship between brain Aβ load and cognitive deficits and decline in patients with AD. Evidence suggests that pathophysiological Aβ dysregulation and accumulation are very early events that precede the onset of cognitive impairment reaching a plateau at the clinical stage of the beginning dementia syndrome. Therefore, research efforts have focused on the role of Aβ in asymptomatic older adults: the results of combined amyloid-PET and neuropsychological studies show a modest but significant correlation between brain fibrillar amyloid load and various subtle cognitive deficits, most notably in challenging episodic associative memory tasks. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological link between cognition and Aβ, a number of combined functional neuroimaging studies have been performed, resulting in early and complex functional alterations in cognitively relevant neural networks such as the default mode network and the largely overlapping episodic memory networks. Multimodal studies using amyloid-tracing imaging methods and neurodegeneration biomarkers strongly suggest that neural network discoordination is specifically related to Aβ-mediated functional and potentially reversible disruption of synaptic plasticity rather than a direct consequence to neurodegenerative pathological processes. These pathophysiological processes and mechanisms may dynamically and non-linearly evolve through fully reversible adaptive compensatory stages and through reactive decompensatory stages into fully irreversible neurodegenerative stages of AD. © 2013 IOS Press.

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients show better everyday functioning in a familiar setting, but they have a reduced ability to access contextual details and episodes associated with a familiar person or environment. This suggests a dysfunction in the neural networks associated with stimulus identification. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the neural activity during the recognition of personally familiar and unfamiliar faces and places among AD patients and elderly controls. We did not find a group difference in the neural activity within brain areas important for perceptual familiarity recognition. Patients showed reduced activation for familiar stimuli in prefrontal brain areas known to be important for retrieving contextual information for a stimulus when compared with controls. These changes may contribute to how AD patients experience a personally familiar face or place. © The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Objective Episodic memory encoding of a verbal message depends upon initial registration, which requires sustained auditory attention followed by deep semantic processing of the message. Motivated by previous data demonstrating modulation of auditory cortical activity during sustained attention to auditory stimuli, we investigated the response of the human auditory cortex during encoding of sentences to episodic memory. Subsequently, we investigated this response in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease (pAD). Methods Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 31 healthy participants were studied. The response in 18 MCI and 18 pAD patients was then determined, and compared to 18 matched healthy controls. Subjects heard factual sentences, and subsequent retrieval performance indicated successful registration and episodic encoding. Results The healthy subjects demonstrated that suppression of auditory cortical responses was related to greater success in encoding heard sentences; and that this was also associated with greater activity in the semantic system. In contrast, there was reduced auditory cortical suppression in patients with MCI, and absence of suppression in pAD. Administration of a central cholinesterase inhibitor (ChI) partially restored the suppression in patients with pAD, and this was associated with an improvement in verbal memory. Interpretation Verbal episodic memory impairment in AD is associated with altered auditory cortical function, reversible with a ChI. Although these results may indicate the direct influence of pathology in auditory cortex, they are also likely to indicate a partially reversible impairment of feedback from neocortical systems responsible for sustained attention and semantic processing.

In this scheme, UMPCA is first employed to extract features directly from the tensorial sMRI data of AD subjects and healthy control (HC) subjects. Then, Laplacian Score is used to select the more discriminative features by evaluating their power of locality preserving. Finally, an SVM classifier is built to distinguish AD patients from HC subjects. Experimental results demonstrate that the UMPCA-LS-based method achieves higher recognition accuracy than existing methods. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with early memory loss, Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, inefficient or ineffective neural processing, and increased risk for AD. Unfortunately, treatments aimed at improving clinical symptoms or markers of brain function generally have been of limited value. Physical exercise is often recommended for people diagnosed with MCI, primarily because of its widely reported cognitive benefits in healthy older adults. However, it is unknown if exercise actually benefits brain function during memory retrieval in MCI. Here, we examined the effects of exercise training on semantic memory activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Seventeen MCI participants and 18 cognitively intact controls, similar in sex, age, education, genetic risk, and medication use, volunteered for a 12-week exercise intervention consisting of supervised treadmill walking at a moderate intensity. Both MCI and control participants significantly increased their cardiorespiratory fitness by approximately 10% on a treadmill exercise test. Before and after the exercise intervention, participants completed an fMRI famous name discrimination task and a neuropsychological battery, Performance on Trial 1 of a list-learning task significantly improved in the MCI participants. Eleven brain regions activated during the semantic memory task showed a significant decrease in activation intensity following the intervention that was similar between groups (p-values ranged 0.048 to 0.0001). These findings suggest exercise may improve neural efficiency during semantic memory retrieval in MCI and cognitively intact older adults, and may lead to improvement in cognitive function. Clinical trials are needed to determine if exercise is effective to delay conversion to AD. © 2013-IOS Press and the authors. All rights reserved.},

abstract={Typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an impaired form of associative memory, recollection, that includes the controlled retrieval of associations. In contrast, familiarity-based memory for individual items may sometimes be preserved in the early stages of the disease. This is the first study that directly examines whole-brain regional activity during one core aspect of the recollection function: associative controlled episodic retrieval (CER), contrasted to item familiarity in AD patients. Cerebral activity related to associative CER and item familiarity in AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a word-pair recognition task to which the process dissociation procedure was applied. Some patients had null CER estimates (AD-), whereas others did show some CER abilities (AD+), although significantly less than HC. In contrast, familiarity estimates were equivalent in the three groups. In AD+, as in controls, associative CER activated the inferior precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). When performing group comparisons, no region was found to be significantly more activated during CER in HC than AD+ and vice versa. However, during associative CER, functional connectivity between this region and the hippocampus, the inferior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly higher in HC than in AD+. In all three groups, item familiarity was related to activation along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). In conclusion, whereas the preserved automatic detection of an old item (without retrieval of accurate word association) is related to parietal activation centred on the IPS, the inferior precuneus/PCC supports associative CER ability in AD patients, as in HC. However, AD patients have deficient functional connectivity during associative CER, suggesting that the residual recollection function in these patients might be impoverished by the lack of some recollection-related aspects such as autonoetic quality, episodic details and verification. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract={Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is important so that preventative measures can be taken. Current techniques for detecting AD rely on cognitive impairment testing which unfortunately does not yield accurate diagnoses until the patient has progressed beyond a moderate AD. In this project, we develop a new approach based on mathematical and image processing techniques for better classification of AD. The most popular current technique analyzes MRI scans using properties of diffeomorphism which generates a mapping from one MRI to another. Since MRIs are very high dimensional vector spaces, the existing technique reduces it to three dimensions and then clusters the images according to presence or lack of AD. However, reducing a high dimensional vector space to three dimensions compromises the information in the data and thus results in some loss of accuracy. We propose to reduce the high dimensional MRI image vector space to 150 dimensions using Principal Component Analysis. In order to categorize the reduced dimensions from PCA for progression of AD, we employ a multiclass neural network. The neural network is trained initially on 230 diagnosed MRIs obtained from OASIS MRI database. We then test our trained neural network on the entire set of 457 MRIs provided by OASIS dataset to confirm the accuracy of diagnosis by our system. Our results produce nearly 90% accuracy in AD diagnosis and classification. © 2013 IEEE.},

abstract={Progress is being made in identifying possible pathogenic factors and novel genes in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many of these could contribute to 'slow excitotoxicity', defined as neuronal loss due to overexcitation as a consequence of decreased energy production due, for instance, to changes in insulin receptor signaling; or receptor abnormalities, such as tau-induced alterations the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor phosphorylation. As a result, glutamate becomes neurotoxic at concentrations that normally show no toxicity. In AD, NMDA receptors are overexcited by glutamate in a tonic, rather than a phasic manner. Moreover, in prodromal AD subjects, functional MRI reveals an increase in neural network activities relative to baseline, rather than loss of activity. This may be an attempt to compensate for reduced number of neurons, or reflect ongoing slow excitotoxicity. This article reviews possible links between AD pathogenic factors such as AβPP/Aβ and tau; novel risk genes including clusterin, phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly protein, complement receptor 1, bridging integrator 1, ATP-binding cassette transporter 7, membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A, CD2-associated protein, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin, and ephrin receptor A1; metabolic changes including insulin resistance and hypercholesterolemia; lipid changes including alterations in brain phospholipids, cholesterol and ceramides; glial changes affecting microglia and astrocytes; alterations in brain iron metallome and oxidative stress; and slow excitotoxicity. Better understanding of the possible molecular links between pathogenic factors and slow excitotoxicity could inform our understanding of the disease, and pave the way towards new therapeutic strategies for AD. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={Recollective confabulation (RC) is encountered as a conviction that a present moment is a repetition of one experienced previously, combined with the retrieval of confabulated specifics to support that assertion. It is often described as persistent déjà vu by family members and caregivers. On formal testing, patients with RC tend to produce a very high level of false positive errors. In this paper, a new case series of 11 people with dementia or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and with déjà vu-like experiences is presented. In two experiments the nature of the recognition memory deficit is explored. The results from these two experiments suggest - contrary to our hypothesis in earlier published case reports - that recollection mechanisms are relatively spared in this group, and that patients experience familiarity for non-presented items. The RC patients tended to be overconfident in their assessment of recognition memory, and produce inaccurate assessments of their performance. These findings are discussed with reference to delusions more generally, and point to a combined memory and metacognitive deficit, possibly arising from damage to temporal and right frontal regions. It is proposed that RC arises from a metacognitive error; an attempt to justify inappropriate feelings of familiarity which leads to false recognition. © 2013.},

abstract={Amyloid imaging studies of presymptomatic familial Alzheimer's disease have revealed the striatum and thalamus to be the earliest sites of amyloid deposition. This study aimed to investigate whether there are associated volume and diffusivity changes in these subcortical structures during the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease. As the thalamus and striatum are involved in neural networks subserving complex cognitive and behavioural functions, we also examined the diffusion characteristics in connecting white matter tracts. A cohort of 20 presenilin 1 mutation carriers underwent volumetric and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging, neuropsychological and clinical assessments; 10 were symptomatic, 10 were presymptomatic and on average 5.6 years younger than their expected age at onset; 20 healthy control subjects were also studied. We conducted region of interest analyses of volume and diffusivity changes in the thalamus, caudate, putamen and hippocampus and examined diffusion behaviour in the white matter tracts of interest (fornix, cingulum and corpus callosum). Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics were also used to provide unbiased whole-brain analyses of group differences in volume and diffusion indices, respectively. We found that reduced volumes of the left thalamus and bilateral caudate were evident at a presymptomatic stage, together with increased fractional anisotropy of bilateral thalamus and left caudate. Although no significant hippocampal volume loss was evident presymptomatically, reduced mean diffusivity was observed in the right hippocampus and reduced mean and axial diffusivity in the right cingulum. In contrast, symptomatic mutation carriers showed increased mean, axial and in particular radial diffusivity, with reduced fractional anisotropy, in all of the white matter tracts of interest. The symptomatic group also showed atrophy and increased mean diffusivity in all of the subcortical grey matter regions of interest, with increased fractional anisotropy in bilateral putamen. We propose that axonal injury may be an early event in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, causing an initial fall in axial and mean diffusivity, which then increases with loss of axonal density. The selective degeneration of long-coursing white matter tracts, with relative preservation of short interneurons, may account for the increase in fractional anisotropy that is seen in the thalamus and caudate presymptomatically. It may be owing to their dense connectivity that imaging changes are seen first in the thalamus and striatum, which then progress to involve other regions in a vulnerable neuronal network. © 2013 The Author).},

abstract={Normal aging and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with declines in navigational skills, including allocentric and egocentric representations, cognitive mapping, landmark processing, and spatial memory. These changes, however, are associated with different patterns of structural and functional alterations in the neural network of navigation. In AD, these changes occur in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, parietal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, prefrontal cortex, and caudate nucleus, whereas in aging, modifications occur mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The navigation abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been found to show different performance patterns, depending on their cognitive profiles. Since patients with MCI do not uniformly develop dementia of the Alzheimer type, it is important to identify reliable early cognitive markers of conversion to AD dementia. In this review, we propose that navigation deficits may help distinguish patients at higher risk of developing AD dementia from individuals with normal cognitive aging and those with other neurodegenerative diseases. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={Image segmentation consists in partitioning an image into different regions. MRI image segmentation is especially interesting, since an accurate segmentation of the different brain tissues provides a way to identify many brain disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia or even the Alzheimer's disease. A large variety of image segmentation approaches have been implemented before. Nevertheless, most of them use a priori knowledge about the voxel classification, which prevents figuring out other tissue classes different from the classes the system was trained for. This paper presents two unsupervised approaches for brain image segmentation. The first one is based on the use of relevant information extracted from the whole volume histogram which is processed by using self-organizing maps (SOM). This approach is faster and computationally more efficient than previously reported methods. The second method proposed consists of four stages including MRI brain image acquisition, first and second order feature extraction using overlapping windows, evolutionary computing-based feature selection and finally, map units are grouped by means of a novel SOM clustering algorithm. While the first method is a fast procedure for the segmentation of the whole volume and provides a way to model tissue classes, the second approach is a more robust scheme under noisy or bad intensity normalization conditions that provides better results using high resolution images, outperforming the results provided by other algorithms in the state-of-the-art, in terms of the average overlap metric. The proposed algorithms have been successfully evaluated using the IBSR and IBSR 2.0 databases, as well as high-resolution MR images from the Nuclear Medicine Department of the "Virgen de las Nieves" Hospital, Granada, Spain (VNH), providing in any case good segmentation results. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

abstract={Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying brain dysfunction induced by amyloid beta-protein (Aβ) represents one of the major challenges for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. The most evident symptom of AD is a severe decline in cognition. Cognitive processes, as any other brain function, arise from the activity of specific cell assemblies of interconnected neurons that generate neural network dynamics based on their intrinsic and synaptic properties. Thus, the origin of Aβ-induced cognitive dysfunction, and possibly AD-related cognitive decline, must be found in specific alterations in properties of these cells and their consequences in neural network dynamics. The well-known relationship between AD and alterations in the activity of several neural networks is reflected in the slowing of the electroencephalographic (EEG) activity. Some features of the EEG slowing observed in AD, such as the diminished generation of different network oscillations, can be induced in vivo and in vitro upon Aβ application or by Aβ overproduction in transgenic models. This experimental approach offers the possibility to study the mechanisms involved in cognitive dysfunction produced by Aβ. This type of research may yield not only basic knowledge of neural network dysfunction associated with AD, but also novel options to treat this modern epidemic. © 2013 Fernando Peña-Ortega.},

abstract={Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition in the brain is one of the key pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neither traditional clinical-pathological studies nor modern in vivo biomarker investigations of brain amyloid load, however, could reveal a convincing relationship between brain Aβ load and cognitive deficits and decline in patients with AD. Evidence suggests that pathophysiological Aβ dysregulation and accumulation are very early events that precede the onset of cognitive impairment reaching a plateau at the clinical stage of the beginning dementia syndrome. Therefore, research efforts have focused on the role of Aβ in asymptomatic older adults: the results of combined amyloid-PET and neuropsychological studies show a modest but significant correlation between brain fibrillar amyloid load and various subtle cognitive deficits, most notably in challenging episodic associative memory tasks. In order to elucidate the pathophysiological link between cognition and Aβ, a number of combined functional neuroimaging studies have been performed, resulting in early and complex functional alterations in cognitively relevant neural networks such as the default mode network and the largely overlapping episodic memory networks. Multimodal studies using amyloid-tracing imaging methods and neurodegeneration biomarkers strongly suggest that neural network discoordination is specifically related to Aβ-mediated functional and potentially reversible disruption of synaptic plasticity rather than a direct consequence to neurodegenerative pathological processes. These pathophysiological processes and mechanisms may dynamically and non-linearly evolve through fully reversible adaptive compensatory stages and through reactive decompensatory stages into fully irreversible neurodegenerative stages of AD. © 2013 - IOS Press and the authors.

abstract={We investigated changes of the scaling exponent alpha estimated by detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) of electroencephalograms (EEG) in patients with dementia including Alzheimer's disease(AD), and attempted to apply a method of pattern recognition using the alpha value-based feature vector to classify dementia. In 9 patients with AD, 8 patients with other types of dementia (vD), and 7 patients without dementia(C), DFA was performed for approximately one minute with background EEG data recorded at 16 different scalp monopoles. The alpha values were significantly higher in patients with AD at electrodes F7, C3, P3, P4, T3, and T5 than in patients without dementia. No significant difference in alpha values was found between patients with vD and without dementia. Then, an artificial neural network (ANN) was trained on the alpha value-based feature vector of EEG to classify patients with dementia into AD and vD. The trained ANN successfully diagnosed all four new test cases of AD. From these observations, it is suggested that AD has a specific pattern in the alpha value-based feature vector. Thus, pattern recognition using alpha value-based feature vector may be useful for the classification of dementia.},

title={Deep learning-based feature representation for AD/MCI classification.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been a great interest in computer-aided diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Unlike the previous methods that consider simple low-level features such as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI, mean signal intensities from PET, in this paper, we propose a deep learning-based feature representation with a stacked auto-encoder. We believe that there exist latent complicated patterns, e.g., non-linear relations, inherent in the low-level features. Combining latent information with the original low-level features helps build a robust model for AD/MCI classification with high diagnostic accuracy. Using the ADNI dataset, we conducted experiments showing that the proposed method is 95.9%, 85.0%, and 75.8% accurate for AD, MCI, and MCI-converter diagnosis, respectively.},

abstract={Deficits in memory for everyday activities are common complaints among healthy and demented older adults. The medial temporal lobes and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are both affected by aging and early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and are known to influence performance on laboratory memory tasks. We investigated whether the volume of these structures predicts everyday memory. Cognitively healthy older adults and older adults with mild Alzheimer's-type dementia watched movies of everyday activities and completed memory tests on the activities. Structural MRI was used to measure brain volume. Medial temporal but not prefrontal volume strongly predicted subsequent memory. Everyday memory depends on segmenting activity into discrete events during perception, and medial temporal volume partially accounted for the relationship between performance on the memory tests and performance on an event-segmentation task. The everyday-memory measures used in this study involve retrieval of episodic and semantic information as well as working memory updating. Thus, the current findings suggest that during perception, the medial temporal lobes support the construction of event representations that determine subsequent memory. © The Author(s) 2013.},
