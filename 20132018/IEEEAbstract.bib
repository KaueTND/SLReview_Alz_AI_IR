abstract={With millions of people suffering from dementia worldwide, the global prevalence of dementia has a significant impact on the patients' lives, their caregivers' physical and emotional states, and the global economy. Early diagnosis of dementia helps in finding suitable therapies that reduce or even prevent further deterioration of patients' cognitive abilities. In recent years, state-of-the-art literature has proposed various computer-aided diagnosis systems based on 3-dimensional brain imagery analysis to identify early symptoms of dementia. These systems aim to assist radiologists in increasing the accuracy of diagnoses and reducing false positives. However, the early diagnosis of dementia is a challenging task due to the image quality, noise, and human brain irregularities. The state-of-the-art has focused on differentiating multi-stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, the diagnosis of various types of dementia is still a gap. This paper proposes a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis approach for the early detection of multi-type of dementia. To show the performance of the proposed CAD algorithm, three conventional CAD methods are implemented for comparison. The proposed algorithm yields a 74.93% accuracy in early diagnosis of multi-type of dementia and outperforms the state of the art CAD methods.},

abstract={When there is a new patient, medical experts usually compare the results with those of previously seen cases for diagnosis and treatment. Besides, the number of digital medical images acquired, stored and managed at the healthcare centres is exponentially increasing each day with the advances in the medical imaging technology. Therefore, automated search and retrieval of similar casesfrom large medical databases may especially improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases whose causes and effects have not yet been fully known. Database management systems used at clinical sites store textual information like name, age, and gender along with medical images. Accordingly, combined usage of image features (content) with demographic and clinical information (context) for similar case search may improve accuracy andreliability of diagnosis, and thus result in increased patient care and lower healthcare costs. In this study we explored the effect of content features extracted from magnetic resonance images and context features such as patient demographics and clinical data on similarity-based disease diagnosis. Our validation on data composed of Alzheimer, Parkinson, Dementia and healty cases showed that combined usage of content and context provides more accurate diagnosis with less features.},

abstract={Most automated techniques for brain disease diagnosis utilize hand-crafted (e.g., voxel-based or region-based) biomarkers from structural magnetic resonance (MR) images as feature representations. However, these hand-crafted features are usually high-dimensional or require regions-of-interest (ROIs) defined by experts. In addition, because of the possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a landmark based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) dataset. Experimental results of both tasks of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval demonstrate that the proposed LDFL method improves the performance of brain disease classification and MR image retrieval.},

abstract={The high throughput 3D neuroimaging datasets have posed great challenges for neuroimaging data retrieval. To achieve more accurate neuroimaging retrieval, various content-based retrieval approaches have been proposed. Recent studies showed a tendency of using the localized features extracted from a subset of the brain structures, instead of the global features extracted from whole brain. However, these studies relied heavily on specific pattern analysis techniques or clinical expertise. In this study we proposed a Multi-Channel pattern analysis approach to identify the most discriminative disease-sensitive brain structures for neurodegenerative disorders and thus to enhance neuroimaging retrieval. The preliminary results suggested that the proposed Multi-Channel pattern analysis approach could confidently identify the brain structures with atrophy and further improve the neuroimaging retrieval performance.},

abstract={Accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in possibly preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients. Among many research tasks, it is of a particular interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical deep learning methods.},

abstract={Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most promising noninvasive techniques for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In this paper, we explore the application of different machine learning techniques to the classification of fMRI data for this purpose. The functional images were first preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox to output individual maps of statistically activated voxels. A fast filter was applied afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and nondemented groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14% average accuracy. Results repeatedly pointed out Brodmann regions with distinct activation patterns between demented and nondemented profiles, indicating that the machine learning analysis described is a powerful method to detect differences in several brain regions between both groups.},

abstract={Detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), a possible biomarker for the Alzheimer disease (AD), has a huge importance for the management of the elderly's healthcare. As the treatment of AD is very costly and the early discovery is beneficial, a low-cost, early detection mechanism is needed. In this study, Electroencephalography (EEG) data from seventeen subjects was used to determine if brain activity could be used to distinguish MCI with cognitively normal individuals and compare classification performance. Event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded in response to auditory speech stimuli. We extracted spectral and temporal features of the ERPs and built a MCI detection process with Support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). We have compared behavioral response against EEG based time domain features, frequency domain features, and top-ranked features of time-frequency domains. Four feature groups of our study demonstrate that the ranked time and frequency domain features of the EEG perform better than behavioral features and other EEG/ERP response metrics. Our results demonstrate the performance of the detection of MCI with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.9%, sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%, and F-score 94%. Ability to objectively and reliably detect MCI at early might lead to efficacious treatment of AD and related disorders.},

abstract={Computerized healthcare has undergone rapid development thanks to the advances in medical imaging and machine learning technologies. Especially, recent progress on deep learning opens a new era for multimedia based clinical decision support. In this paper, we use deep learning with brain network and clinical relevant text information to make early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The clinical relevant text information includes age, gender and ApoE gene of the subject. The brain network is constructed by computing functional connectivity of brain regions using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) data. A targeted autoencoder network is built to distinguish normal aging from mild cognitive impairment, an early stage of AD. The proposed method reveals discriminative brain network features effectively and provides a reliable classifier for AD detection. Compared to traditional classifiers based on R-fMRI time series data, 31.21% improvement of the prediction accuracy on average is achieved by the proposed deep learning method, and standard deviation reduces by 51.23% on average that means our prediction model is more stable and reliable compared to traditional methods. Our work excavates deep learning's advantages of classifying high-dimensional multimedia data in medical services, and could help predict and prevent AD at an early stage.},

abstract={The human brain consists of many different neural elements that comprise a functioning processing and control system. Though each area has its unique role, they do not operate separately. It is empirically known that during brain activity, different elements affect each other. Such neural network's activity is called Functional Brain Connectivity (FBC). It is a known phenomenon among athletes who suffer mild head injuries frequently along their career, to be more likely to suffer from neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's at old age. This phenomenon has been studied by physicians and health researchers as early as 1971 [1]. Patients who suffered from frequent mild head injuries have no neurological appearable symptoms at young age. FBC abnormality accompanies the mentioned neurological diseases, each characterizes with a different pattern [2], [3]. These two facts led the hypothesis that frequent head injuries can, with some probability, cause FBC abnormalities. Proving this hypothesis and mapping the transformed pattern of FBC can contribute to understanding neurological diseases and by this help the search after treatment generally and preventing for frequent mild injured athletes particularly. This work offers a technology that enables brain researchers to evaluate and locate abnormalities in FBC using fMRI data of a patient. It does so using the fact that connectivity pattern, at rest state, is to a large extent symmetrical. The system evaluates connectivity between classes of voxels using a new nonlinear-Differential Filtered Coherence. It is a mathematical solution for describing connections that are not necessary linear by following the influences of changes in one signal on the changes in another. Finally, the system finds FBC asymmetry using registration of the generated connectivity map between the two hemispheres of the brain.},

abstract={Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The 3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the CADDementia MRI dataset with no skull-stripping preprocessing have shown our 3D-CNN outperforms several conventional classifiers by accuracy. Abilities of the 3D-CNN to generalize the features learnt and adapt to other domains have been validated on the ADNI dataset.},

abstract={Accurate and early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a significant part for the patient care and development of future treatment. Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) neuroimages are effective modalities that can help physicians to diagnose AD. In past few years, machine-learning algorithm have been widely studied on the analyses for multi-modality neuroimages in quantitation evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft features after image preprocessing such as registration, segmentation and feature extraction, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. This paper proposes to construct multi-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn and combine the multi-modality features for AD classification using MRI and PET images. First, the deep 3D-CNNs are constructed to transform the whole brain information into compact high-level features for each modality. Then, a 2D CNNs is cascaded to ensemble the high-level features for image classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from MRI and PET imaging data for AD classification. No rigid image registration and segmentation are performed on the brain images. Our proposed method is evaluated on the baseline MRI and PET images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database on 193 subjects including 93 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and 100 normal controls (NC) subjects. Experimental results and comparison show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 89.64% for classification of AD vs. NC, demonstrating the promising classification performance.},

abstract={In the last decade, pattern recognition methods using neuroimaging data for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been the subject of extensive research. Deep learning has recently been a great interest in AD classification. Previous works had done almost on single modality dataset, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), shown high performances. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. The corporation of multimodalities can solve this issue since it discovers and uses the further complementary of hidden biomarkers from other modalities instead of only one, which itself cannot provide. We therefore propose a deep learning method on fusion multimodalities. In details, our approach includes Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) train and test on combined PET-MRI data to diagnose the disease status of a patient. We focus on advantages of multimodalities to help providing complementary information than only one, lead to improve classification accuracy. We conducted experiments in a dataset of 1272 scans from ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 90% between AD patients and healthy controls, demonstrate the improvement than using only one modality.},

The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12% for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is seen to be the most significant for aMCI, while Accumbens area and ventricle are most significant for naMCI.},

abstract={Initial stages of Alzheimer's disease are easily confused with the normal aging process. Additionally, the methodology involved in the diagnosis by radiologists can be subjective and difficult to document. In this scenario, the development of accessible approaches capable of supporting the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. Various approaches have been employed with this objective, specially using brain MRI scans. Although certain satisfactory accuracy results have been achieved, most of the approaches requires very specific pre-processing steps based on the brain anatomy. In this paper, we present a novel image retrieval approach for supporting the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic, based on general use features and unsupervised post-processing step. The brain MRI scans are processed and retrieved through general features without any pre-processing step. In the following, a rankbased unsupervised distance learning procedure is performed for improving the effectiveness of the initial results. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach can achieve effective retrieval results, being suitable in aiding the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

pages={1-14},
abstract={In this paper, a novel electroencephalographic (EEG)-based method is introduced for the quantification of brain-electrical connectivity changes over a longitudinal evaluation of mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects. In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and θ bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, θ, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach, appears to provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density modifications associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing noninvasive EEG signals.},

abstract={This paper describes the research made toward improving medical case retrieval for Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Our approach considers using Magnetic Resonance Images as an input for the search. To improve the retrieval process, we used longitudinal information extracted from the different sets of scans acquired at different time points and automatically extracted descriptors to represent input images. All experiments were performed with and without quality control (QC) to determine the influence of the errors caused by the automated processing to the results relevance. For the experiments, a total of 267 subjects from the AD Neuroimaging Initiative database with available scans at baseline, the 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month follow-ups were selected. The obtained results showed that the selection of the time points for extraction of the longitudinal information influences the retrieval performance. Results also showed that not all automatically generated descriptors lead to improvement of the results. Longitudinal volume changes provide the most relevant representation. Adding QC phase in the experiments leads to improvements in all examined scenarios. The results showed that the most frequent automatically selected features are common semantic markers for AD.},

The Content-Based Visual information retrieval (CBVIR) approach is then applied to recognize patient category. The contribution of the paper is in the fusion of visual signatures and of classification results obtained on characteristic brain regions.

abstract={The timely and accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is important for preventing the progress of the irreversible disease. Recently, various types of imaging techniques, e.g. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET), have been widely used for the diagnosis of AD. Despite their usefulness, the image data generated are high-dimensional and noisy which make it difficult to give accurate diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel feature selection approach to detect the informative features from MRI data, which improves both the diagnosis accuracy and reduces the computational cost. Benchmarking results on the AD challenge datasets show that our proposed approach outperforms other popular feature selection methods. Furthermore, compared with the top winners of the challenge, our approach performs best in diagnosis of AD and has comparable performance with others in the detection of mild cognitive impairments (MCIs). The good performance on the real data demonstrate that our proposed approach is effective in prediction of ADs.},

abstract={In the recent years, deep learning has gained huge fame in solving problems from various fields including medical image analysis. This work proposes a deep convolutional neural network based pipeline for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its stages using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Alzheimer's disease causes permanent damage to the brain cells associated with memory and thinking skills. The diagnosis of Alzheimer's in elderly people is quite difficult and requires a highly discriminative feature representation for classification due to similar brain patterns and pixel intensities. Deep learning techniques are capable of learning such representations from data. In this paper, a 4-way classifier is implemented to classify Alzheimer's (AD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and healthy persons. Experiments are performed using ADNI dataset on a high performance graphical processing unit based system and new state-of-the-art results are obtained for multiclass classification of the disease. The proposed technique results in a prediction accuracy of 98.8%, which is a noticeable increase in accuracy as compared to the previous studies and clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for patient care and will be increasingly important as disease modifying agents become available, early in the course of the disease. Although studies have applied machine learning methods for the computer-aided diagnosis of AD, a bottleneck in the diagnostic performance was shown in previous methods, due to the lacking of efficient strategies for representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one setting and has the potential to require less labeled data. A performance gain was achieved in both binary classification and multiclass classification of AD. The advantages and limitations of the proposed framework are discussed.},

abstract={The paper introduces a novel approach to short term memory modeling using electroencephalographic signals acquired from occipital, prefrontal and parietal lobes of the subjects during the recognition of asymmetric two-dimensional object shapes. Each subject is presented with a two-dimensional object of irregular geometry and is asked to remember it for a short period until he/she is instructed to draw the two-dimensional shape of the object. After the drawing is complete, the reference two-dimensional shape and the one produced by the subject are compared. The paper attempts to model Short term memory using unsupervised Hebbian Learning, considering functional invariance of the other relevant brain modules lying on the encoding and recall pathways of the memory. An error norm is defined to measure the magnitude of the error between the input and reproduced shape pattern, and thereby is used to adapt the short term memory. A small value in error indicates proper learning of the proposed short term memory model, and thus can be used to discriminate people with memory failure. Experiments undertaken reveal that the error metric could be used successfully to detect memory failures in five patients, two of whom were in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, two of whom suffer from amnesia, and one patient with parietal lobe damage. The proposed short term memory model thus is expected to have applications in detecting memory failures in shape-recognition tasks.},

The latter is a widely used statistical-based technique that allows the detection of alterations in brain tissue. In our study, we used VBM to detect significant grey matter alterations of the hippocampal region in AD patients, which is consistent with previous findings reported in the literature. We also examined how the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores relates to the volume differences detected by VBM1.},

abstract={Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI through machine learning have been a subject of intense research in recent years. Recent success of deep learning in computer vision have progressed such research further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG and Inception are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is re-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image entropy to select the most informative slices for training. Through experimentation on the OASIS MRI dataset, we show that with training size almost 10 times smaller than the state-of-the-art, we reach comparable or even better performance than current deep-learning based methods.},

The first four moments and the entropy of the histograms of these regions are computed. Receiver Operating Characteristics curves are then used to rank the ability of regions to separate PET brain images. Twenty one selected regions are input to both Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers and evaluation is done on 142 brain PET images. Classification results are better than those obtained when using the whole 116 initial regions or when inputting the whole brain voxels.

title={A Nonparametric Approach for Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD Conversion Prediction: Results on Longitudinal Data},
year={2017},
volume={21},
number={5},
pages={1403-1410},
abstract={The goal of this study is to introduce a nonparametric technique for predicting conversion from Mild Cognitive impairment (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progression of a slowly progressing disease such as AD benefits from the use of longitudinal data; however, research till now is limited due to the insufficient patient data and short follow-up time. A small dataset size invalidates the estimation of underlying disease progression model; hence, a supervised nonparametric method is proposed. While depicting a real-world setting, longitudinal data of three years are employed for training, whereas only the baseline visit's data is used for validation. The train set is preprocessed for extraction of two dense clusters representing the subjects who remain stable at MCI or progress to AD after three years of the baseline visit. Similarity between these clusters and the test point is calculated in Euclidean space. Multiple features from two modalities of biomarkers, i.e., neuropsychological measures (NM) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry are also analyzed. Due to the limited MCI dataset size (NM: 145, MRI: 52, NM+MRI: 29), leave-one-out cross validation setup is employed for performance evaluation. The algorithm performance is noted for both unimodal case and bimodal cases. Superior performance (accuracy: 89.66%, sensitivity: 87.50%, specificity: 92.31%, precision: 93.33%) is delivered by multivariate predictors. Three notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Longitudinal data are more powerful than the temporal data, 2) MRI is a better predictor of MCI-to-AD conversion than NM, and 3) multivariate predictors outperform single predictor models.},

abstract={Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI), a condition in which the memory functions of cognition are significantly impaired, is an established risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a tool capable of measuring the dynamics of the brain's neural networks, and is thus an important means in analysis and understanding of aMCI. In this proof-of-concept study, we compared the brain activation patterns of ten aMCI subjects with those of four healthy subjects during sleep by employing a 64-channel EEG data collection system. The power spectrum was analyzed to identify sleep stages, while spectral topography and source imaging techniques were employed to study the fluctuating patterns of the brain. Results of this study show an increase in activation power across all sleep stages in the delta and theta frequency bands alongside a decrease in alpha band activity for aMCI subjects. Source imaging analysis of the resting EEG identified default mode network, which becomes decoupled as sleep stages deepen. In the proof-of-concept study, our exploratory analysis demonstrated the feasibility of imaging dynamic network organization using EEG in aMCI.},

abstract={Successful, timely diagnosis of neuropsychiatry diseases is key to management. Research efforts in the area of diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease have used various aspects of computer-aided multi-class diagnosis approaches with varied degrees of success. However, there is still need for more efficient and reliable approaches to successful diagnosis of the disease. This research used deep learning framework with modified k-sparse autoencoder (oKSA) classification to locate neutrally degenerated areas of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low amyloid beta 1-42 imaging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid; each with a sample of 150 images. Results show a correlation between computational demarcation of infected regions and the images. Degeneration in the studied areas was evidenced by high phosphorylated t-/p-tau levels in CSF, regional fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and the presence of atrophy patterns. The use of σKSA algorithm in boosting classification helped to improve the classifier performance. The KSA method with deep learning framework is used for the first time to produce accurate results in diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract={Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, affecting approximately 10% of individuals under 65 years of age, with the prevalence doubling every 5 years up to age 80, above which the prevalence exceeds 40%. Currently diagnosis of AD is largely based on the examination of clinical history and tests such as MMSE (Mini-mental state examination) and PAL (Paired Associates Learning). However many present studies have highlighted the inaccuracies and limitations of such tests. Thus medical officers are now moving to the more accurate neuroimaging data (Magnetic Resonance Imaging- MRI) based diagnosis for these types of diseases where brain atrophy transpires. However it is a considerable challenge to analyse large numbers of images manually to get the most accurate diagnosis at present.},

abstract={Multimodal medical data from various information sources are often used to depict patients. We refer to each source as a `view'. Multi-view features could provide complementary information to each other; thus by fusing the multi-view features, we could greatly enhance the current medical content-based retrieval framework. In this paper, we propose a Co-neighbor Multi-view Spectral Embedding (CMSE) algorithm, which is an advanced feature fusion method based on the multi-view spectral analysis. CMSE aims to seek a smooth embedding for the multi-view features by maximizing the neighborhood affinity across all feature spaces. We evaluated the proposed CMSE algorithm using a freely available neuroimaging database, ADNI, with 331 pre-diagnosed subjects. Totally, 9 views of features were extracted for validation, and an improved retrieval performance was achieved over other state-of-art feature fusion methods.},

abstract={Current medical content-based retrieval (MCBR) systems for neuroimaging data mainly focus on retrieving the cross-sectional neuroimaging data with similar regional or global measurements. The longitudinal pathological changes along different time-points are usually neglected in such MCBR systems. We propose the cross-registration based retrieval for longitudinal MR data to retrieve patients with similar structural changes as an extension to the existing MCBR systems. The diffeomorphic demons registration is used to extract the tissue deformation between two adjacent MR volumes. An asymmetric square dissimilarity matrix is designed for indexing the patient changes within a specific interval. A visual demonstration is given to show the registration displacement fields of the query as compared to the simulated results. The experimental performance with the mean average precision (mAP) and the average top-K accuracy (aACC) are reported for evaluation.},

abstract={Episodic memory is a conglomerate of autobiographical events, times, places, associated emotions, and other contextual who, what, when, where, why knowledge that can be explicitly stated. It is the collection of past personal experiences that occurred at a particular time and place. An emotion plays a pivotal role in the formation of memory; it can either enhance memory or impair cognition. Memory plays a crucial role in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Dementia. Analyzing the retrieval of memory helps in better understanding of the disorders. The main aim of this paper is to find an integrated relationship between different regions of brain and the episodic memory recall, through functional connectivity parameters such as coherence, direct transfer function (DTF), partial directed coherence (PDC) for four different emotions namely fear, happy, anger and gratefulness. It was observed that there was a significant variation in DTF and PDC of temporal and frontopolar regions during retrieval of angry and fear events in theta and beta bands.},

abstract={The monitoring of volumetric changes in the brain during neurological diseases is done with three dimensional structural MR images. Numerical methods are needed to evaluate the volumetric difference between healthy and diseased MR image groups. Voxel based morphometry is a numerical method used to perform inter-group and intra-group analysis of MR images. With this method, the volume differences between the groups can be analyzed in the coordinate dimension. In this study, volumetric differences between Alzheimer and Normal MR images were investigated by voxel based morphometry. From these differences, three dimensional volume loss masks of groups were obtained. The mask of loss was masked with the gray matter area where the basic volume losses of Alzheimer's begin. In each gray matter image, the voxel values corresponding to the same coordinates as the loss mask were transformed into a vector. The voxel values corresponding to the same point as the loss point were ranked by t-test and the most significant coordinate values were ranked. After this ranking, classification was done with support vector machines using voxel values. As a result of this model, the number of voxel coordinates giving the best classification was determined and the performance of the method was measured.},

abstract={In this paper, we present a novel approach for classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and normal subjects from Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI) using a proposed `sequential Projection Based Learning for Meta-cognitive q-Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McqRBFN)' classifier. The McqRBFN has two components, namely, a cognitive component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is a single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with a q-Gaussian activation function, that allows different RBF's in one network, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy functions, by changing a real q-parameter. The meta-cognitive component present in McqRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McqRBFN employs a sequential Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm to reduce the computational effort used in training. For simulation studies, we have used MRI data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM) is used for feature extraction from MRI data and extracted VBM features are fed into the PBL-McqRBFN classifier. The experimental results show that our proposed PBL-McqRBFN classifier can accurately differentiate MCI and normal subjects.},

abstract={During the recent years, there have been many studies implemented on the automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using different methods. The focus of most of these studies has relied upon the detection of AD from neu-roimaging data. However, recognizing symptoms early as much as possible(Pre-detection) is crucial as disease modifying drugs will be most effective if administered early in the course of disease, before the occurrence of irreversible brain damages. Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from such data. We report an experimental approach to evaluate the best pre-detection method of AD. Our study consists of two main experiments. Those two experiments were implemented using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Prior to our first experiment we have stated an assumption which is, if there is a successful AD detection method that will be successful in AD pre-detection also. Different studies have used different data sets and different diagnosing methods. Therefore we have verified the existing and the most successful detection method which is Support Vector Machine (SVMs) as the first experiment. According to the results obtained from the initial experiment (detection study) the sensitivity is 95.3%, the specificity is 71.4% and the accuracy is 84.4% with use of a SVM. Since those results were not successful, a deep learning based technique (Convolutional Neural Network) was proposed as the second experiment. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was being tested using different image segmentation methods and different datasets. Finally the best image segmentation method obtained a high accuracy around 96% (sensitivity - 96%, specificity - 98%). And the CNN model remains unbiased to the dataset. Results of those experiments suggest an important role for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using image processing and deep - earning techniques.},

pages={2259-2266},
abstract={This work proposes multiclass deep learning classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using novel texture and other associated features extracted from structural MRI. Two distinct learning models (Model 1 and 2) are presented where both include subcortical area specific feature extraction, feature selection and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) deep neural network (DNN). The models learn highly complex and subtle differences in spatial atrophy patterns using white matter volumes, gray matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and different types of Fractal Brownian Motion co-occurrence matrices for texture as features to classify AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in dementia patients. A five layer SAE with state-of-the-art dropout learning is trained on a publicly available ADNI dataset and the model performances are evaluated at two levels: one using in-house tenfold cross validation and another using the publicly available CADDementia competition. The in-house evaluations of our two models achieve 56.6% and 58.0% tenfold cross validation accuracies using 504 ADNI subjects. For the public domain evaluation, we are the first to report DNN to CADDementia and our methods yield competitive classification accuracies of 51.4% and 56.8%. Further, both of our proposed models offer higher True Positive Fraction (TPF) for AD class when compared to the top-overall ranked algorithm while Model 1 also ties for top diseased class sensitivity at 58.2% in the CADDementia challenge. Finally, Model 2 achieves strong disease class sensitivity with improvement in specificity and overall accuracy. Our algorithms have the potential to provide a rapid, objective, and non-invasive assessment of AD.},

abstract={Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.},

abstract={Early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is important so that preventative measures can be taken. Current techniques for detecting AD rely on cognitive impairment testing which unfortunately does not yield accurate diagnoses until the patient has progressed beyond a moderate AD. In this project, we develop a new approach based on mathematical and image processing techniques for better classification of AD. The most popular current technique analyzes MRI scans using properties of diffeomorphism which generates a mapping from one MRI to another. Since MRIs are very high dimensional vector spaces, the existing technique reduces it to three dimensions and then clusters the images according to presence or lack of AD. However, reducing a high dimensional vector space to three dimensions compromises the information in the data and thus results in some loss of accuracy. We propose to reduce the high dimensional MRI image vector space to 150 dimensions using Principal Component Analysis. In order to categorize the reduced dimensions from PCA for progression of AD, we employ a multiclass neural network. The neural network is trained initially on 230 diagnosed MRIs obtained from OASIS MRI database. We then test our trained neural network on the entire set of 457 MRIs provided by OASIS dataset to confirm the accuracy of diagnosis by our system. Our results produce nearly 90% accuracy in AD diagnosis and classification.},

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) plays a significant role in patient care, especially at the early stage, because the consciousness of the severity and the progression risks allows the patients to take prevention measures before irreversible brain damages are shaped. Although many studies have applied machine learning methods for computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD recently, a bottleneck of the diagnosis performance was shown in most of the existing researches, mainly due to the congenital limitations of the chosen learning models. In this study, we design a deep learning architecture, which contains stacked auto-encoders and a softmax output layer, to overcome the bottleneck and aid the diagnosis of AD and its prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Compared to the previous workflows, our method is capable of analyzing multiple classes in one setting, and requires less labeled training samples and minimal domain prior knowledge. A significant performance gain on classification of all diagnosis groups was achieved in our experiments.},

abstract={Although there is no cure to date, Alzheimer's disease detection in early stages has a significant impact on the patient's life in terms of cost, the progress, and helping to plan in advance for an appropriate healthcare in the life ahead as well as providing clinical etiologies for further research. This paper discusses implementing a feature fusion method utilizing sparse and denoising autoencoders to reveal the stage of Alzheimer's disease. Four cohorts consisted of individuals with Alzheimer's disease, late mild cognitive impairment, early mild cognitive impairment, and normal control groups are classified using multinomial logistic regression fueled by the fusion of high-level and low-level features. The high-level features are extracted from the stacked autoencoders. The results show that feature fusion enhance the performance of typical autoencoders. However, the performance of feature fusion using denoising autoencoders is superior to that of the sparse training of autoencoders in terms of overall accuracy, precision, and recall.},

abstract={The aim of this pilot study was to analyze spontaneous electroencephalography (EEG) activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by means of Cross-Sample Entropy (Cross-SampEn) and two local measures derived from graph theory: clustering coefficient (CC) and characteristic path length (PL). Five minutes of EEG activity were recorded from 37 patients with dementia due to AD and 29 elderly controls. Our results showed that Cross-SampEn values were lower in the AD group than in the control one for all the interactions among EEG channels. This finding indicates that EEG activity in AD is characterized by a lower statistical dissimilarity among channels. Significant differences were found mainly for fronto-central interactions (p <; 0.01, permutation test). Additionally, the application of graph theory measures revealed diverse neural network changes, i.e. lower CC and higher PL values in AD group, leading to a less efficient brain organization. This study suggests the usefulness of our approach to provide further insights into the underlying brain dynamics associated with AD.},

A quantitative evaluation of this disease, using computer aided methods, is of importance. In this paper a novel ranking method of the effectiveness of brain region of interest to classify healthy and AD brain is developed. Brain images are first segmented into 116 regions according to an anatomical atlas. A spatial normalization and four grey level normalization methods are used for comparison. Each extracted region is then characterized by a feature set based on grey level histogram moments and age and gender. Using a receiver Operating Characteristic curve for each region, it was possible to rank region's ability to separate healthy from AD brain images. Using a set of selected regions, according to their rank, and when inputting them to a Support Vector Machine, it was possible to show that classification results were similar or slightly better to those obtained when using the whole voxels or the 116 regions as input features to the classifier.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder with progressive impairment of memory and cognitive functions. It brings increasingly troubling in today's society. Its early diagnosis and warning are particularly important. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) play an important role to help understand the brain anatomical changes related to AD. Traditional methods are usually based on extraction of handcrafted features and training a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a classification method based on combination of multimodel 3D convolutional networks to learn the various features from MR brain images. First, a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) is built to hierarchically transform the MR image into more compact high-level features. Second, the multiscale 3D convolutional autoencoders (3D CAEs) are constructed to extract features from MR brain images. The features learned by these models are combined with the upper fully connected layers for image classification in AD diagnosis. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from the imaging data for classification without segmentations of brain tissues and regions. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted MR brain images on 428 subjects including 199 AD patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.31% for AD classification and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.73%, demonstrating the promising classification performances.},

abstract={Content-Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) methods applieds to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are penetrating the universe of IT tools for clinical decision support. A clinician can take profit from retrieving subjects' scans with similar patterns. The CBVIR approach has been used since recently for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The most explored imaging modality in this context is the structural MRI. The Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively recent technique and CBVIR approaches have not yet been developed on it. The combination of several MRI modalities improves the performances of CBVIR methods, but first of all it is necessary to explore the ability of DTI modality to give a correct answer alone. The present work is amongst the earliest attempts to use visual features as in a generic CBVIR, on this modality for AD research. The proposed approach is based on the comparison of visual features extracted from the hippocampal area. We use the Circular Harmonic Functions (CHFs) to describe the content of the Diffusion Tensor-derived map: Mean Diffusivity (MD). This study was first accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset and then with the DTI scans of a French epidemiological study: “Bordeaux-3City”. The obtained results are encouraging and open interesting perspectives.},

In this work, a stacked DPN (S-DPN) algorithm is proposed to further improve feature representation. We then propose a multi-modality S-DPN (MM-S-DPN) algorithm to fuse multi-modality neuroimaging data and learn more discriminative and robust feature representation for AD classification. Experiments are performed on ADNI dataset with MRI and PET images as multi-modality data. The results indicate that S-DPN is superior to DPN and stacked auto-encoder algorithms. Moreover, MM-S-DPN achieves best performance compared with single-modality S-DPN and other multi-modality feature learning based algorithms.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain degenerative disorder which often happens in people aged more than 65 years old. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future treatment. Positrons Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be a powerful tool to help understand the brain changes related to AD. Most existing methods extract the handcraft features from images, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. The success of these computer-aided diagnosis methods highly depends on the image preprocessing, including rigid registration and segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), which learns the features of 3D PET images by decomposing the 3D image into a sequence of 2D slices. In this framework, the hierarchical 2D CNNs are built to capture the intra-slice features while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is used to extract the inter-slice features for final classification. No rigid image registration and segmentation are required for PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline PET images from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 95.28% for classification of AD vs. NC and 83.90% for classification of MCI vs. NC, respectively, demonstrating the promising classification performance.},

abstract={In this paper, a novel method for detecting the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans is presented. It uses a combination of three different machine learning algorithms in order to get improved results and is based on a three-class classification problem. The three classes for classification considered in this study are normal, very mild AD and mild and moderate AD subjects. The machine learning algorithms used are: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification, with its performance optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Genetic algorithm (GA) used for feature selection. A Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used for feature extraction from the MRI images and GA is used to reduce the high dimensional features needed for classification. The GA-ELM-PSO classifier yields an average training accuracy of 94.57 % and a testing accuracy of 87.23 %, averaged across the three classes, over ten random trials. The results clearly indicate that the proposed approach can differentiate between very mild AD and normal cases more accurately, indicating its usefulness in detecting the onset of AD.},

abstract={In recent years, data-driven approaches have been developed to predict Alzheimer's Disease. The goal of our report is to identify the factors that are most associated with memory loss. Data from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuro-imaging Initiative) with 8 variables from socioeconomic factors and biomarkers are analyzed, and will be used to propose a predictive model for the onset of AD. On the mathematical side, we propose to evaluate the data and the results for stability and reproducibility. Principal component analysis was first adopted to directly visualize the data structure and gain intuitive understanding. PCA shows a clustering of biomarkers TAUAB42, APOE4 and the current diagnosis DXCURREN, another clustering of characteristic variables including sex, age and education level, and the response AVLTot by itself. Furthermore, in the second principal component, which signifies a contrast between the characteristic descriptors and the biomarkers APOE4 and TAUAB42. The sex of the respondents played a significant effect: the contrast is larger for males and smaller for females. Linear regression model using backwards elimination further reached the result that the degree of memory loss indicated by AVLTot0 is positively related to education, but negatively related to gender, age, APOE4 and TAUAB420. In addition, higher level of TAUAB420 is related to lower memory function, and this decline effect is more dramatic for people who are younger.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease as one type of dementia can cause problems to human memory, thinking and behavior. The brain damage can be detected using brain volume and whole brain form. The correlation between brain shrinkage and reduction of brain volume can affect to deformation texture. In this research, the enhancement texture approach was proposed, called advanced local binary pattern (ALBP) method. ALBP is introduced as a 2D and 3D feature extraction descriptor. In the ALBP, sign and magnitude value were introduced as an enhancement to the previous LBP method. Due to a great number of features are produced by ALBP, the principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis are used as feature selection method. Furthermore, SVM classifier is applied for multiclass classification including Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, and normal condition of whole brain and hippocampus. The experimental results from two scenarios (ALBP sign magnitude (2D) and ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes (3D) methods) show better accuracy and performance compare to previous method. Our proposed method achieved the average value of accuracy between 80% - 100% for both the whole brain and hippocampus data. In addition, uniform rotation invariant ALBP sign magnitude using three orthogonal planes as a 3D descriptor also outperforms other approaches with an average accuracy of 96.28% for multiclass classifications for whole brain image.},

The results showed that Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder were the most genetically similar based on the SNPs associated with them. Also, Schizophrenia had the highest number of SNPs associated with it as well as the highest betweenness rank. The gene TRNAI25 was the gene found among four of the disorders and it is implicated in various biological roles such as coding, decoding, regulation, and expression of genes. The drug, Felodipine, targets two SNPs, one associated with Schizophrenia and the other with Bipolar Disorder.

abstract={Brains of patients with dementia show physical differences according to disease types and phases. Physical characteristics of brains such as cortical thickness and volumes of some parts have a significant effect on determining the type of the disease. Magnetic resonance imaging devices create visual files which contain patient information appropriate to the medical imaging standards. Using image processing techniques, numerical expressions of patients' brains can be extracted via these files. By means of using these numeric values with classification methods, patients can be classified. In this study, samples having three diseases: Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and fron to temporal dementia are used. After extracting cortical surface area, thickness and volume features, samples are classified successfully with artificial neural networks due to feature selection.},

abstract={Modern e-health systems have undergone rapid development thanks to the advances in communications, computing and machine learning technology. Especially, deep learning has great superiority in image analysis and disease prediction. In this paper, we use Alzheimer's Disease (AD) as an example to show advantages of deep learning in diagnosing brain diseases and providing clinical decision support. Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), about 25% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The e-health field becomes more complete and effective owing to that. Our work helps predict AD at an early stage and take measures to slow down or even prevent the onset of it.},

abstract={Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a neurological disease which is often comorbid with early stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study explores the potential for detecting changes in neurological functional organization which may be indicative of MCI and early AD using neural network models for scalp EEG signal reconstruction. Resting 32-channel EEG records from 48 age-matched participants (mean age 75.7 years)-15 normal controls (NC), 16 MCI, and 17 early-stage AD-are examined. Neural network models are trained to reconstruct artificially “deleted” samples of EEG using subsets of records from NC participants. Models are applied to EEG records and quality scores are assigned to reconstructions of individual channels. Principal components of regional average reconstruction quality scores are used in a support vector machine model to discriminate between groups. Analyses demonstrate accuracies of 90.3% for MCI vs. NC (p-value<;0.0005), 90.6% for AD vs. NC (p-value<;0.0003), and 87.5% for AD/MCI vs. NC (p-value<;0.0003). Techniques developed here may be used to detect changes in EEG activity due to neurological degeneration associated with MCI and early AD.},

This paper presents a novel computer-aided diagnosis technique for brain PET images classification in the case of AD. Brain images are first segmented into Regions Of Interest (ROI) using an atlas. Computing some statistical parameters on these regions, we define a Separation Power Factor (SPF) associated to each region. This factor quantifies the ability of each region to separate AD from Healthy Control (HC) brain images.

abstract={Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a molecular medical imaging modality which is commonly used for neurodegenerative diseases diagnosis. Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), based on medical image analysis could help quantitative evaluation of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A novel method of ranking the effectiveness of brain Volume Of Interest (VOI) to separate healthy control (HC) from AD brains PET images is presented in this paper. Brain images are first mapped into anatomical VOIs using an atlas. Histogram-based features are then extracted and used to select and rank VOIs according to the Area Under Curve (AUC) parameter, which produces a hierarchy of the ability of VOIs to separate between groups of subjects. The top-ranked VOIs are then input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The developed method is evaluated on a local data base image and compared to known selection feature methods. Results show that using AUC outperforms classification results in the case of a two group separation.},

abstract={Multi-kernel learning machine (MKLM) has recently been introduced to the research of computer-aided dementia identification and pathology progress tracking. Despite its good performance especially in case of using heterogeneous data, such learning schema and its variants usually utilize a L-l norm constraint that promotes sparse solutions, which may cause loss of potentially important information. In this paper, we propose the non-sparse infinite-kernel learning machine (NS-IKLM) for automated identification of Alzheimer cases from normal controls. In our approach, a modified constraint is utilized to promotes non-sparse solutions and kernel parameters are automatically tuned during the learning process. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a set of FDG-PET images selected from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaing initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results demonstrate that the proposed non-sparse NS-IKLM is able to achieve satisfying dementia identification at a relatively low computational cost.},

abstract={In spite of the worldwide financial and research efforts made, the pathophysiological mechanism at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still poorly understood. Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure.},

abstract={Retrieving medical images that present similar diseases is an active research area for diagnostics and therapy. However, it can be problematic given the visual variations between anatomical structures. In this paper, we propose a new feature extraction method for similarity computation in medical imaging. Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance.},

abstract={Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a common form of senile dementia. Although our understanding of the key steps underlying neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is incomplete, it is clear that it begins long before symptoms are noticed by patient. Conventional clinical decision making systems are more manual in nature and ultimate conclusion in terms of exact diagnosis is remote. The solution for this is the employment of advanced Biomedical Engineering Technology for making diagnosis. Any disease modifying treatments which are developed are most possibly to be achieving success if initiated early in the process, and this needs that we tend to develop reliable, validated and economical ways to diagnose Alzheimer's kind pathology. However, despite comprehensive searches, no single test has shown adequate sensitivity and specificity, and it is likely that a combination will be needed. The parameters of the human body related to AD can be profiled using computers that can be utilized for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There are several imaging techniques used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's type pathology. Prominent of them are Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Scanning (SPECT) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The previous and recent studies made on Alzheimer's disease clearly investigated that there are some parameter changes on the retina of the eye of AD patients. In this research we have classify the OCT retinal images using neural networks for the early diagnosis of AD.},

Therefore, in this study we propose an automated feedback extraction method to exclude the involvement of radiologists. Instead of incorporating the feedbacks from them, the similarity relationship between the initial retrieval results and all candidate images is used to indicate the preferences of these retrieved items regarding to the query, i.e., relevance or irrelevance, and to further re-rank the candidates. The experimental results on a publicly available brain image dataset for neurodegenerative disorder diagnosis demonstrate the promising retrieval performance of the proposed method.},

abstract={The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage, i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET), has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification and multiclass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.},

abstract={Modern pattern recognition and artificial intelligence systems can help in providing better health care and medical solutions. The performance of human diagnosis degrades due to fatigue, cognitive biases, systems faults, and distractions. However, artificial intelligence based diagnosis systems are less error prone and give safe support to clinicians in detection and decision making. This work presents a smart and reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible early stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease and leads to severe memory loss and inability to cope with daily life tasks. The diagnosis of AD from structural images requires great skill and is challenging for human diagnostics. The presented framework is based on deep learning and detects Alzheimer's and its initial stages accurately from structural MRI scans. The framework analyzes four different classes simultaneously in a single setup. The testing accuracy of diagnosis obtained by the method is 98.88%. Experiments are also performed on binary data and transfer learning is applied for multiclass classification achieving 99.7% accuracy. Once a good trained model is obtained, the decision for an unseen test scan is given within a few seconds. These models are free from the factors that are responsible for causing human diagnostic errors. Therefore, these models are dependable and can provide much faster diagnosis.},
