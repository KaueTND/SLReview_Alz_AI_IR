Abstract = {{The brain vasculature can be investigated in different ways ranging from
   in vivo to biochemical analysis. Immunohistochemistry is a simple and
   powerful technique that can also be applied to archival tissues.
   However, staining of brain vessels on paraffin sections has been
   challenging. In this study, we developed an optimized method that can be
   used in paraffin-embedded mouse and human brain tissues derived from
   healthy controls and neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease.
   We subsequently showed that this method is fully compatible with the
   detection of glial cells and key markers of Alzheimer's disease
   including amyloid beta and phosphorylated Tau protein. Furthermore, we
   observed that the length of microvasculature in hippocampus of TgCRND8
   Alzheimer's disease mouse model is reduced, which is correlated with the
   decreased blood flow in hippocampus as determined by arterial spin
   labeling perfusion magnetic resonance imaging. Finally, we determined
   that the microvasculature length in two other Alzheimer's disease mouse
   models, APP and PS1 double-transgenic mice and P301S Tau-transgenic
   mice, is also shortened in the dentate gyrus. Thus, we have established
   a new, simple and robust method to characterize the brain vasculature in
   the mouse and human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Nonlinear analysis of EEG recordings allows detection of characteristics
   that would probably be neglected by linear methods. This study aimed to
   determine a suitable epoch length for nonlinear analysis of EEG data
   based on its recurrence rate in EEG alpha activity (electrodes Fz, Oz,
   and Pz) from 28 healthy and 64 major depressive disorder subjects. Two
   nonlinear metrics, Lempel-Ziv complexity and scaling index, were applied
   in sliding windows of 20 seconds shifted every 1 second and in
   nonoverlapping windows of 1 minute. In addition, linear spectral
   analysis was carried out for comparison with the nonlinear results. The
   analysis with sliding windows showed that the cortical dynamics
   underlying alpha activity had a recurrence period of around 40 seconds
   in both groups. In the analysis with nonoverlapping windows, long-term
   nonstationarities entailed changes over time in the nonlinear dynamics
   that became significantly different between epochs across time, which
   was not detected with the linear spectral analysis. Findings suggest
   that epoch lengths shorter than 40 seconds neglect information in EEG
   nonlinear studies. In turn, linear analysis did not detect
   characteristics from long-term nonstationarities in EEG alpha waves of
   control subjects and patients with major depressive disorder patients.
   We recommend that application of nonlinear metrics in EEG time series,
   particularly of alpha activity, should be carried out with epochs around
   60 seconds. In addition, this study aimed to demonstrate that long-term
   nonlinearities are inherent to the cortical brain dynamics regardless of
   the presence or absence of a mental disorder.}},

Title = {{Social and cognitive control skills in long-life occupation activities
   modulate the brain reserve in the behavioural variant of frontotemporal
   dementia}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{99}},
Pages = {{311-318}},

Abstract = {{Background: Cognitive reserve may delay disease onset and mitigate
   symptoms presentation in neurodegenerative dementias. Although high
   occupation levels can be associated with higher cognitive reserve in the
   behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), it was never
   addressed how specific occupation profiles involving social interaction,
   executive and attention abilities can modulate neural reserve in bvFTD.
   Materials and methods: We retrospectively included thirty-seven bvFTD
   patients with clinical-neuropsychological and FDG-PET brain metabolic
   data. We considered occupation levels according to 1) a 5-point scale
   and 2) the specific cognitive dimensions from the O{*}Net network
   database. We used the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with the
   O{*}Net variables most representative of ``worker{''} and
   ``occupation{''} socio-cognitive skills to merge the best components
   describing such occupation profiles. We then performed regression
   analyses with brain metabolism using either 5-level occupation scale or
   the PCA specific profiles as independent variables, controlling for
   education and disease severity.
   Results: According to the brain reserve hypothesis, higher occupation
   levels were associated with a more severe hypometabolism in the
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, among the identified PCA
   profiles, social skills were associated with severe hypo metabolism in
   medial and dorsolateral prefrontal regions, and cognitive control in the
   left fronto-insular cortex.
   Discussion: This study contributes to define the role of specific
   occupation profiles as proxy of cognitive reserve in bvFTD, providing
   the first evidence for social interaction and cognitive control skills
   in life-occupation activities as influencing factors of neural reserve
   against neurodegeneration in bvFTD. Jobs placing high demand on such
   abilities seem to act as protective factors in bvFTD. (C) 2017 Elsevier

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In brain structural segmentation, multi-atlas strategies are
   increasingly being used over single-atlas strategies because of their
   ability to fit a wider anatomical variability. Patch-based label fusion
   (PBLF) is a type of such multi-atlas approaches that labels each target
   point as a weighted combination of neighboring atlas labels, where atlas
   points with higher local similarity to the target contribute more
   strongly to label fusion. PBLF can be potentially improved by increasing
   the discriminative capabilities of the local image similarity
   measurements. We propose a framework to compute patch embeddings using
   neural networks so as to increase discriminative abilities of
   similarity-based weighted voting in PBLF. As particular cases, our
   framework includes embeddings with different complexities, namely, a
   simple scaling, an affine transformation, and non-linear
   transformations. We compare our method with state-of-the-art
   alternatives in whole hippocampus and hippocampal subfields segmentation
   experiments using publicly available datasets. Results show that even
   the simplest versions of our method outperform standard PBLF, thus
   evidencing the benefits of discriminative learning. More complex
   transformation models tended to achieve better results than simpler
   ones, obtaining a considerable increase in average Dice score compared
   to standard PBLF. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate differences in hippocampal activity between
   premenstrual syndrome (PMS) patients and healthy controls, to elucidate
   the neural mechanisms of PMS.
   Materials and Methods: Twenty female patients with PMS (PMS group) and
   21 healthy controls (HC group) underwent a single-shot gradient-recalled
   echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence scan during the luteal phase in 3.0
   Tesla MRI. Spontaneous neural activity in hippocampus (HIPP) was
   measured by fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF).
   Functional connectivity (FC) was used to examine the neural networks of
   PMS patients by selecting the abnormal HIPP as the seed region. All
   participants completed a daily record of severity of problems (DRSP)
   questionnaire to measure the severity of clinical symptoms.
   Results: Results from a two-sample t-test showed increased left HIPP
   fALFF in the PMS group compared with the HC group (P = 0.042), while
   there was no between-group difference of fALFF in the right HIPP (P =
   0.1011). A secondary analysis using a two-sample t-test with the left
   HIPP as the seed region, the results revealed that the PMS group
   exhibited increased FC between the left HIPP and left medial prefrontal
   cortex (mPFC), left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), right middle
   cingulate cortex (MCC), and bilateral precentral cortex (PC), while
   decreased FC between the left HIPP and right orbitofrontal cortex (OFC).
   Moreover, the PMS group exhibited higher DRSP scores, which were
   positively correlated (r = 0.64, P = 0.003) with FC between the left
   HIPP and mPFC during the luteal phase.
   Conclusion: Altered spontaneous neural activity and connectivity of left
   HIPP may be involved in PMS.}},

Abstract = {{While the neural correlates of age-related decline in episodic memory

   architecture of the brain for various memory processes in elderly
   adults, such as immediate recall (IR) and delayed recall (DR), remains

   age-related decline of various memory processes. A total of 66
   cognitively normal older adults (aged 60-80 years) participated in this
   study. Memory processes were measured using the Auditory Verbal Learning
   Test as well as resting-state brain images, which were analyzed using
   both regional homogeneity (ReHo) and correlation-based functional
   connectivity (FC) approaches. We found that both IR and DR were
   significantly correlated with the ReHo of these critical regions, all
   within the default mode network (DMN), including the parahippocampal
   gyrus, posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus, inferior parietal lobule,
   and medial prefrontal cortex. In addition, DR was also related to the FC
   between these DMN regions. These results suggest that the DMN plays
   different roles in memory retrieval across different retention
   intervals, and connections between the DMN regions contribute to memory
   consolidation of past events in healthy older people.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Hippocampal atrophy is a supportive feature for the

   expert neuroradiologist, tracing the hippocampus and measuring its

   the development of reliable fully-automated segmentation algorithms is
   of paramount importance.
   Materials and methods: The present study evaluates (i) the precision and
   the robustness of the novel Hippocampal Unified Multi-Atlas Network
   (HUMAN) segmentation algorithm and (ii) its clinical reliability for AD
   diagnosis. For these purposes, we used a mixed cohort of 456 subjects
   and their T1 weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scans. The
   cohort included 145 controls (CTRL), 217 mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   subjects and 94 AD patients from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). For each subject the baseline, repeat, 12 and 24

   Results: HUMAN provides hippocampal volumes with a 3\% precision; volume
   measurements effectively reveal AD, with an area under the curve (AUC)
   AUC(1) = 0.08 +/- 0.02. Segmented volumes can also reveal the subtler

   is stable and reproducible over time, even for 24 month follow-up scans.
   Conclusions: The experimental results demonstrate HUMAN is a precise
   segmentation algorithm, besides hippocampal volumes, provided by HUMAN,
   can effectively support the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and become
   a useful tool for other neuroimaging applications.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized
   by progressive loss of memory and cognitive deficit. The observed
   amnesia in the early stages of AD is suggested to be a retrieval
   problem, rather than encoding and consolidation deficit. According to
   the cholinergic hypothesis of AD, scopolamine is used to induce an
   animal model of amnesia. Howbeit the effect of scopolamine on memory
   retrieval is contradictory. This study aimed to assess the effect of
   scopolamine on passive avoidance memory retrieval. Additionally
   according to the reported changes of MMP-2, MMP-9 and MAPKs (ERK, P38
   and JNK) in AD pathology the hippocampal contents of these proteins were
   determined. Male NMRI mice weighing 20-25 g were trained in passive
   avoidance apparatus. The drug or its vehicle was injected 24 h after
   training (30 min before retention test). The hippocampal tissue was
   isolated and western blot analysis was done for MMP-2, MMP-9 and MAPKs
   (ERK, P38 and JNK). The results indicated that scopolamine (1 mg/kg)
   disrupts passive avoidance memory retrieval. This scopolamine treatment
   resulted in hippocampal MMP-2 and MMP-9 decline while increased MAPKs in
   the hippocampus. These results suggest that cholinergic system has an
   important role in learnt memory retrieval. It might also suggest the
   positive role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in this phase of memory while propose
   that MAPKs affect negatively the reactivation of memory which is
   compatible with MAPKs activation in AD.}},

Abstract = {{Here we test the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative process in
   Parkinson's disease (PD) moves stereotypically along neural networks,

   patients (n = 105) and matched controls (n = 57) underwent T1-MRI at

   Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally
   or structurally) to a ``disease reservoir{''} evaluated by MRI at
   baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one
   described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest

Abstract = {{PURPOSE. Precise measurements of visual fixation and its instability
   were recorded during optical coherence tomography (OCT) as a marker of
   neural network dysfunction in multiple sclerosis (MS), which could be
   used to monitor disease progression or response to treatment.
   METHODS. A total of 16 MS patients and 26 normal subjects underwent 30
   seconds of scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO)-based eye tracking during
   OCT scanning of retinal layer thickness. Study groups consisted of
   normal eyes, MS eyes without prior optic neuritis (MS wo ON), and MS
   eyes with prior optic neuritis (MS + ON). Kernel density estimation
   quantified fixation instability from the distribution of fixation points
   on the retina. In MS wo ON eyes, fixation instability was compared to
   other measures of visual and neurologic function.
   RESULTS. Fixation instability was increased in MS wo ON eyes (0.062
   deg(2)) compared to normal eyes (0.030 deg(2), P = 0.015). A further
   increase was seen for MS + ON eyes (0.11 deg(2)) compared to MS wo ON (P
   = 0.04) and normal (P = 0.006) eyes. Fixation instability correlated
   weakly with ganglion cell layer (GCL) volume and showed no correlation
   with low-contrast letter acuity, EDSS score, or SDMT score.
   CONCLUSIONS. Fixation instability reflects the integrity of a widespread
   neural network germane to visual processing and ocular motor control,
   and is disturbed in MS. Further study of visual fixation, including the
   contribution of microsaccades to fixation instability, may provide
   insight into the localization of fixation abnormalities in MS and
   introduce innovative and easily measured outcomes for monitoring
   progression and treatment response.}},

Abstract = {{The discrimination of early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal
   form (i.e., mild cognitive impairment, MCI) from cognitively healthy
   control (HC) subjects is crucial since the treatment is more effective
   in the first stages of the dementia. The aim of our study is to evaluate
   the usefulness of a methodology based on electroencephalography (EEG) to
   detect AD and MCI. EEG rhythms were recorded from 37 AD patients, 37 MCI
   subjects and 37 HC subjects. Artifact-free trials were analyzed by means
   of several spectral and nonlinear features: relative power in the
   conventional frequency bands, median frequency, individual alpha
   frequency, spectral entropy, Lempel-Ziv complexity, central tendency
   measure, sample entropy, fuzzy entropy, and auto-mutual information.
   Relevance and redundancy analyses were also conducted through the fast
   correlation-based filter (FCBF) to derive an optimal set of them. The
   selected features were used to train three different models aimed at
   classifying the trials: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
   discriminant analysis (QDA) and multi-layer perceptron artificial neural
   network (MLP). Afterwards, each subject was automatically allocated in a
   particular group by applying a trial-based majority vote procedure.
   After feature extraction, the FCBF method selected the optimal set of
   features: individual alpha frequency, relative power at delta frequency
   band, and sample entropy. Using the aforementioned set of features, MLP
   showed the highest diagnostic performance in determining whether a
   subject is not healthy (sensitivity of 82.35\% and positive predictive
   value of 84.85\% for HC vs. all classification task) and whether a
   subject does not suffer from AD (specificity of 79.41\% and negative
   predictive value of 84.38\% for AD vs. all comparison). Our findings
   suggest that our methodology can help physicians to discriminate AD, MCI
   and HC.}},

Abstract = {{The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its early stage,
   i.e., mild cognitive impairment, is essential for timely treatment and
   possible delay of AD. Fusion of multimodal neuroimaging data, such as
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET),
   has shown its effectiveness for AD diagnosis. The deep polynomial
   networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which
   performs well on both largescale and small-size datasets. In this study,
   a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM- SDPN consists of
   two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation
   from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically
   speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI
   and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse
   multimodal neuroimaging information. The proposed MM-SDPN algorithm is
   applied to the ADNI dataset to conduct both binary classification
   andmulticlass classification tasks. Experimental results indicate that
   MM-SDPN is superior over the state-of-the-art multimodal
   feature-learning-based algorithms for AD diagnosis.}},

Year = {{2018}},
Volume = {{43}},
Pages = {{157-168}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{In conventional Magnetic Resonance (MR) image based methods, two stages
   are often involved to capture brain structural information for disease
   diagnosis, i.e., 1) manually partitioning each MR image into a number of
   regions-of-interest (ROIs), and 2) extracting pre-defined features from
   each ROI for diagnosis with a certain classifier. However, these
   pre-defined features often limit the performance of the diagnosis, due
   to challenges in 1) defining the ROls and 2) extracting effective
   disease-related features. In this paper, we propose a landmark-based
   deep multi-instance learning (LDMIL) framework for brain disease
   diagnosis. Specifically, we first adopt a data-driven learning approach
   to discover disease-related anatomical landmarks in the brain MR images,
   along with their nearby image patches. Then, our LDMIL framework learns
   an end-to-end MR image classifier for capturing both the local
   structural information conveyed by image patches located by landmarks
   and the global structural information derived from all detected
   landmarks. We have evaluated our proposed framework on 1526 subjects
   from three public datasets (i.e., ADNI-1, ADNI-2, and MIRIAD), and the
   experimental results show that our framework can achieve superior
   performance over state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Episodic memory is critical to daily life functioning. This type of
   declarative memory declines with age and is the earliest cognitive
   function to be compromised in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Subjective
   memory complaints are commonly reported by older adults and have been
   considered a risk factor for developing AD. The possibilities for
   prevention of memory disorders in older adults have increased
   substantially in recent years. Previous studies have shown that anodal
   transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) applied over the left
   lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) after a contextual reminder strengthened
   existing verbal episodic memories, conceivably through reconsolidation,
   in elderly people. In this study, we hypothesized that anodal tDCS
   applied over the left lateral PFC after a contextual reminder would
   improve delayed memory retrieval relative to placebo (sham) stimulation
   in elderly individuals with SMC. Twenty-two subjects learned a list of
   words. Twenty-four hour later, tDCS (anodal or placebo) was applied over
   the left lateral PFC after a contextual reminder. Memory retrieval was
   tested 48h and 30 days later. These findings showed that anodal tDCS
   over the left lateral PFC strengthened existing episodic memories, a
   behavioral effect documented by improved recognition up to 30 days,
   relative to placebo stimulation. This study suggests that tDCS after a
   contextual reminder can induce long-lasting beneficial effects by
   facilitating the consolidation processes and opens up the possibility to
   design specific non-invasive interventions aimed at preventing memory
   decline in this at-risk population.}},

Abstract = {{In the wake of the use of deep learning algorithms in medical image
   analysis, we compared performance of deep learning algorithms, namely
   the deep Boltzmann machine (DBM), convolutional encoder network (CEN)

   conventional machine learning schemes: Support vector machine (SVM) and
   random forest (RF), for white matter hyperintensities (WMH) segmentation
   on brain MRI with mild or no vascular pathology. We also compared all
   these approaches with a method in the Lesion Segmentation Tool public
   toolbox named lesion growth algorithm (LGA). We used a dataset comprised
   of 60 MRI data from 20 subjects in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) database, each scanned once every year during three
   consecutive years. Spatial agreement score, receiver operating
   characteristic and precision-recall performance curves, volume
   disagreement score, agreement with intra-/inter-observer reliability
   measurements and visual evaluation were used to find the best
   configuration of each learning algorithm for WMH segmentation. By using
   optimum threshold values for the probabilistic output from each
   algorithm to produce binary masks of WMH, we found that SVM and RF

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Episodic memory undergoes dramatic improvement in early childhood; the
   reason for this is poorly understood. In adults, episodic memory relies
   on a distributed neural network. Key brain regions that supporting these
   processes include the hippocampus, portions of the parietal cortex, and
   portions of prefrontal cortex, each of which shows different
   developmental profiles. Here we asked whether developmental differences
   in the axonal pathways connecting these regions may account for the
   robust gains in episodic memory in young children. Using diffusion
   weighted imaging, we examined whether white matter connectivity between
   brain regions implicated in episodic memory differed with age, and were
   associated with memory performance differences in 4- and 6-year-old
   children. Results revealed that white matter connecting the hippocampus
   to the inferior parietal lobule significantly predicted children's
   performance on episodic memory tasks. In contrast, variation in the
   white matter connecting the hippocampus to the medial prefrontal cortex
   did not relate to memory performance. These findings suggest that
   structural connectivity between the hippocampus and lateral parietal
   regions is relevant to the development of episodic memory.}},

Abstract = {{The importance of the hippocampus in the study of several
   neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease makes it a
   structure of great interest in neuroimaging. However, few segmentation
   methods have been proposed to measure its subfields due to its complex

   In this work, we present a new pipeline for automatic hippocampus
   subfield segmentation using two available hippocampus subfield
   delineation protocols that can work with both high and standard
   resolution data. The proposed method is based on multi-atlas label
   fusion technology that benefits from a novel multi-contrast patch match
   search process (using high resolution T1-weighted and T2-weighted
   images). The proposed method also includes as post-processing a new
   neural network-based error correction step to minimize systematic
   segmentation errors. The method has been evaluated on both high and
   standard resolution images and compared to other state-of-the-art
   methods showing better results in terms of accuracy and execution time.}},

Abstract = {{There is a rapidly growing group of aging adults with autism spectrum

   function in older adults with ASD is understudied. We combined
   functional and structural neuroimaging and neuropsychological tests to

   neurotypical (NT) men. Participants (ASD, n=16; NT, n=17) aged 40-64
   years were well-matched according to age, IQ (range: 83-131), and
   education (range: 9-20 years). Middle-age adults with ASD made more
   errors on an executive function task (Wisconsin Card Sorting Test) but
   performed similarly to NT adults on tests of delayed verbal memory (Rey
   Auditory Verbal Learning Test) and local visual search (Embedded Figures
   Task). Independent component analysis of a functional MRI working memory
   task (n-back) completed by most participants (ASD=14, NT=17) showed
   decreased engagement of a cortico-striatal-thalamic-cortical neural

Abstract = {{The aim of the present study was to examine cross state-dependent
   learning between ACPA (a selective cannabinoid CB1 receptor agonist) and
   muscimol (a selective GABAA receptor agonist) in the step-down
   inhibitory avoidance learning task. The dorsal hippocampal CA1 regions
   of adult male NMRI mice were bilaterally cannulated, and all drugs were
   microinjected into the intended sites of injection.
   Post-training and/or pre-test administration of ACPA (1 and 2 ng/mouse)
   dose-dependently induced amnesia. Pre-test microinjection of the same
   doses of ACPA reversed the post-training ACPA-induced amnesia. This
   event has been named ACPA state-dependent learning (SDL).
   Post-training and/or pre-test microinjection of muscimol (0.05 and 0.1
   mu g/mouse) dose-dependently induced amnesia. Pre-test administration of
   the same doses of muscimol reversed the post-training muscimol-induced
   amnesia, suggesting muscimol SDL.
   The amnesia induced by post-training administration of ACPA was reversed
   by pre-test administration of muscimol (0.05 and 0.1 mu g/mouse).
   Furthermore, the pre-test microinjection of muscimol (0.025 and 0.05 mu
   g/mouse) with an ineffective dose of ACPA (0.5 ng/mouse) significantly
   restored memory retrieval and induced ACPA SDL.
   In another series of experiments, the amnesia induced by post-training
   administration of muscimol was reversed by pre-test administration of
   ACPA (1 and 2 ng/mouse). Moreover, pre-test microinjection of ACPA (0.5
   and 1 ng/mouse) with an ineffective dose of muscimol (0.025 mu g/mouse)
   significantly restored memory retrieval and induced muscimol SDL.
   It is important to note that pre-test intra-CA1 injection of a selective
   GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculline (0.125 and 0.25 mu g/mouse), 5
   min before the administration of muscimol (0.1 mu g/mouse) or ACPA (2
   ng/mouse) dose-dependently inhibited muscimol- and ACPA-induced SDL,
   respectively. Pre-test intra-CA1 administration of bicuculline (0.0625,
   0.125 and 0.25 mu g/mouse) by itself did not affect memory retention.
   In conclusion, the data strongly revealed a cross SDL among ACPA and
   muscimol in the dorsal hippocampal CA1 regions.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Changes in cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF) in response to
   a cognitive task (task-related Delta CBF) have been shown by
   Transcranial Doppler ultrasonography (TCD) to be reduced in slow
   walkers. However, it is unknown whether reduced task-related Delta CBF
   is associated with reduced neural activity in specific brain regions, as
   measured by blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI).
   Methods: We assessed the regional changes in neural activity associated
   with reduced middle cerebral artery (MCA) task-related Delta CBF to an
   executive task and slow walking speed in 67 community-dwelling older
   adults from the MOBILIZE Boston Study. Participants underwent walking
   assessments and TCD ultrasonography measures of MCA Delta CBF during the
   n-back task of executive function. A subset of participants (n = 27)
   completed the same task during fMRI. Individual BOLD activation maps for
   the n-back task were correlated with TCD measures and network-level
   averages were associated with TCD and preferred walking speed.
   Results: Participants with diminished task-related Delta CBF walked more
   slowly (beta = .39, p = .001). fMRI revealed significant associations
   between task-related Delta CBF and regional BOLD activation in several
   brain regions/networks supplied by the MCA. Of these regions and
   networks, those within the executive network were most strongly
   associated with walking speed (beta = .36, p = .01).
   Conclusions: Task-related Delta CBF during an executive function task is
   related to activation in several neural networks and impairment in the
   ability to recruit the executive network in particular is associated
   with slow walking speed in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Background and Objectives: A huge number of solutions based on
   computational systems have been recently developed for the
   classification of cognitive abnormalities in older people, so that
   individuals at high risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases, such
   as Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer?s disease, can be identified
   before the manifestation of the diseases. Several factors are related to
   these pathologies, making the diagnostic process a hard problem to
   solve. This paper proposes a computational model based on the artificial
   neural network to classify data patterns of older adults. Methods: The
   proposal takes into account the several parameters as diagnostic factors
   as gender, age, the level of education, study time, and scores from
   cognitive tests (Mini-Mental State Examination, Semantic Verbal Fluency
   Test, Clinical Dementia Rating and Ascertaining Dementia). This
   non-linear regression model is designed to classify healthy and
   pathological aging with machine learning techniques such as neural
   networks, random forest, SVM, and stochastic gradient boosting. We
   deployed a simple linear regression model for the sake of comparison.
   The primary objective is to use a regression model to analyze the data
   set aiming to check which parameters are necessary to achieve high
   accuracy in the diagnosis of neurodegenerative disorders. Results: The
   analysis demonstrated that the usage of cognitive tests produces median
   values for the accuracy greater than 90\%. The ROC analysis shows that
   the best sensitivity performance is above 98\% and specificity of 96\%
   when the configurations have only cognitive tests. Conclusions: The
   presented approach is a valuable tool for identifying patients with
   dementia or MCI and for supporting the clinician in the diagnostic
   process, by providing an outstanding support decision tool in the
   diagnostics of neurodegenerative diseases. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {{Age-related effects on brain activity during encoding and retrieval of
   episodic memories are well documented. However, research typically tests
   memory only once, shortly after encoding. Retaining information over
   extended periods is critical, and there are reasons to expect
   age-related effects on the neural correlates of durable memories. Here,
   we tested whether age was associated with the activity elicited by
   durable memories. One hundred forty-three participants (22-78 years)
   underwent an episodic memory experiment where item-context relationships
   were encoded and tested twice. Participants were scanned during encoding
   and the first test. Memories retained after 90 minutes but later
   forgotten were classified as transient, whereas memories retained after
   5 weeks were classified as durable. Durable memories were associated
   with greater encoding activity in inferior lateral parietal and
   posteromedial regions and greater retrieval activity in frontal and
   insular regions. Older adults exhibited lower posteromedial activity
   during encoding and higher frontal activity during retrieval, possibly
   reflecting greater involvement of control processes. This demonstrates
   that long-lasting memories are supported by specific patterns of
   cortical activity that are related to age. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{The rise of neuroimaging in research and clinical practice, together
   with the development of new machine learning techniques has strongly
   encouraged the Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) of different diseases and
   disorders. However, these algorithms are often tested in proprietary
   datasets to which the access is limited and, therefore, a direct
   comparison between CAD procedures is not possible. Furthermore, the
   sample size is often small for developing accurate machine learning
   methods. Multi-center initiatives are currently a very useful, although
   limited, tool in the recruitment of large populations and
   standardization of CAD evaluation. Conversely, we propose a brain image
   synthesis procedure intended to generate a new image set that share
   characteristics with an original one. Our system focuses on nuclear
   imaging modalities such as PET or SPECT brain images. We analyze the
   dataset by applying PCA to the original dataset, and then model the
   distribution of samples in the projected eigenbrain space using a
   Probability Density Function (PDF) estimator. Once the model has been
   built, we can generate new coordinates on the eigenbrain space belonging
   to the same class, which can be then projected back to the image space.
   The system has been evaluated on different functional neuroimaging
   datasets assessing the: resemblance of the synthetic images with the
   original ones, the differences between them, their generalization
   ability and the independence of the synthetic dataset with respect to
   the original. The synthetic images maintain the differences between
   groups found at the original dataset, with no significant differences
   when comparing them to real-world samples. Furthermore, they featured a

Volume = {{12}},
Number = {{11}},
Month = {{NOV 8}},
Abstract = {{Background
   In this study we investigated the role of hippocampal volume (HV) in
   visual memory.
   Methods
   Participants were a subsample of older adults (> = 70 years) from the
   Einstein Aging Study. Visual performance was measured using the Complex
   Figure (CF) copy and delayed recall tasks from the Repeatable Battery
   for the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status. Linear regressions were
   fitted to study associations between HV and visual tasks.
   Results
   Participants' (n = 113, mean age = 78.9 years) average scores on the CF
   copy and delayed recall were 17.4 and 11.6, respectively. CF delayed
   recall was associated with total (beta = .031, p = 0.001) and left (beta
   = 0.031, p = 0.001) and right HVs (beta =0.24, p = 0.012). CF delayed
   recall remained significantly associated with left HV even after we also
   included right HV (beta = 0.27, p = 0.025) and the CF copy task (beta =
   0.30, p = 0.009) in the model. CF copy did not show any significant
   associations with HV.
   Conclusion
   Our results suggest that left HV contributes in retrieval of visual
   memory in older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Older adults experience impairments in episodic memory, ranging from
   mild to clinically significant. Given the critical role of the medial
   temporal lobe (MTL) in episodic memory, age-related changes in MTL
   structure and function may partially account for individual differences
   in memory. Using ultra-high-field 7T structural MRI and high-resolution
   3T functional MRI (hr-fMRI), we evaluated MTL subfield thickness and
   function in older adults representing a spectrum of cognitive health.
   Participants performed an associative memory task during hr-fMRI in
   which they encoded and later retrieved face-name pairs. Motivated by
   prior research, we hypothesized that differences in performance would be
   explained by the following: (i) entorhinal cortex (ERC) and CA1 apical
   neuropil layer {[}CA1-stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare (SRLM)]
   thickness, and (ii) activity in ERC and the dentate gyrus (DG)/CA3
   region. Regression analyses revealed that this combination of factors
   significantly accounted for variability in memory performance. Among
   these metrics, CA1-SRLM thickness was positively associated with memory,
   whereas DG/CA3 retrieval activity was negatively associated with memory.
   Furthermore, including structural and functional metrics in the same
   model better accounted for performance than did single-modality models.
   These results advance the understanding of how independent but
   converging influences of both MTL subfield structure and function
   contribute to age-related memory impairment, complementing findings in
   the rodent and human postmortem literatures.}},

Title = {{Generalized Psychophysiological Interaction (PPI) Analysis of Memory
   Related Connectivity in Individuals at Genetic Risk for Alzheimer's
   Disease}},
Journal = {{JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Number = {{129}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{In neuroimaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures
   the blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) signal in the brain. The
   degree of correlation of the BOLD signal in spatially independent
   regions of the brain defines the functional connectivity of those
   regions. During a cognitive fMRI task, a psychophysiological interaction
   (PPI) analysis can be used to examine changes in the functional
   connectivity during specific contexts defined by the cognitive task. An
   example of such a task is one that engages the memory system, asking
   participants to learn pairs of unrelated words (encoding) and recall the
   second word in a pair when presented with the first word (retrieval). In
   the present study, we used this type of associative memory task and a
   generalized PPI (gPPI) analysis to compare changes in hippocampal
   connectivity in older adults who are carriers of the Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) genetic risk factor apolipoprotein-E epsilon-4 (APOE epsilon 4).
   Specifically, we show that the functional connectivity of subregions of
   the hippocampus changes during encoding and retrieval, the two active
   phases of the associative memory task. Context-dependent changes in
   functional connectivity of the hippocampus were significantly different
   in carriers of APOEe4 compared to non-carriers. PPI analyses make it
   possible to examine changes in functional connectivity, distinct from
   univariate main effects, and to compare these changes across groups.
   Thus, a PPI analysis may reveal complex task effects in specific cohorts
   that traditional univariate methods do not capture. PPI analyses cannot,
   however, determine directionality or causality between functionally
   connected regions. Nevertheless, PPI analyses provide powerful means for
   generating specific hypotheses regarding functional relationships, which
   can be tested using causal models. As the brain is increasingly
   described in terms of connectivity and networks, PPI is an important
   method for analyzing fMRI task data that is in line with the current
   conception of the human brain.}},

Abstract = {{Network-sensitive neuroimaging methods have been used to characterize
   large-scale brain network degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and its
   prodrome. However, few studies have investigated the combined effect of
   Alzheimer's disease and cerebrovascular disease on brain network
   degeneration. Our study sought to examine the intrinsic functional
   connectivity and structural covariance network changes in 235 prodromal
   and clinical Alzheimer's disease patients with and without
   cerebrovascular disease. We focused particularly on two higher-order
   cognitive networks-the default mode network and the executive control
   network. We found divergent functional connectivity and structural
   covariance patterns in Alzheimer's disease patients with and without
   cerebrovascular disease. Alzheimer's disease patients without
   cerebrovascular disease, but not Alzheimer's disease patients with
   cerebrovascular disease, showed reductions in posterior default mode
   network functional connectivity. By comparison, while both groups
   exhibited parietal reductions in executive control network functional
   connectivity, only Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular
   disease showed increases in frontal executive control network
   connectivity. Importantly, these distinct executive control network
   changes were recapitulated in prodromal Alzheimer's disease patients
   with and without cerebrovascular disease. Across Alzheimer's disease
   patients with and without cerebrovascular disease, higher default mode
   network functional connectivity z-scores correlated with greater
   hippocampal volumes while higher executive control network functional
   connectivity z-scores correlated with greater white matter changes. In
   parallel, only Alzheimer's disease patients without cerebrovascular
   disease showed increased default mode network structural covariance,
   while only Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease
   showed increased executive control network structural covariance
   compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate the differential neural
   network structural and functional changes in Alzheimer's disease with
   and without cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that the underlying
   pathology of Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease
   might differ from those without cerebrovascular disease and reflect a
   combination of more severe cerebrovascular disease and less severe
   Alzheimer's disease network degeneration phenotype.}},

   efficiently distinguish between subject groups. We also show that the
   connectome-convolutional network is capable to combine information from
   diverse functional connectivity metrics and that models using a
   combination of different connectivity descriptors are able to outperform
   classifiers using only one metric. From this flexibility follows that
   our proposed CCNN model can be easily adapted to a wide range of
   connectome based classification or regression tasks, by varying which
   connectivity descriptor combinations are used to train the network.}},

Title = {{Henry, where have you lost your Self?}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{95}},
Pages = {{37-50}},
Month = {{OCT}},
Abstract = {{The Self is a complex construct encompassing distinct components,
   including episodic and semantic autobiographical memory, the
   Self-concept, and the subjective sense of Self, which highest level
   consists of Self-awareness. The neuro-anatomical correlates are complex,
   and it is debated as to whether a common region could support these
   different components of the Self, with a particular interest for the
   cortical midline structures and the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC).
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes an interesting model for the study
   of Self as autobiographical memory typically deteriorates as the disease
   progresses. Here, we report the unexpected case of Henry, a patient with
   MCI due to AD who was unable to produce any personal autobiographical
   memories, nor describe his Self-concept, had a poor personal semantic
   memory, and disclosed unusual anosognosia for this stage of the disease.
   His cognitive performance was compared to a group of matched AD patients
   and a group of healthy controls confirming that the main components of
   his Self were degraded. We hypothesized that it was due to a marked
   atrophy within the cortical midline, as visually assessed on his MRI. We
   further elucidated these findings through Voxel-based morphometry
   analysis, which confirmed a significant atrophy of the MPFC that was
   specific to this patient. Moreover, this revealed significant atrophy
   within the bilateral insular cortex. Given the stage of the disease, the
   degradation of the Self is unlikely to be accounted for by deficient
   mnemonic processes, especially as the presence of discrete temporal
   atrophy was noted. We suggest that this specific pattern of MPFC and
   insular atrophy is responsible for the systematic collapse of the
   patient's Self, through the breakdown of the subjective sense of Self,
   which is proposed as a prerequisite to all other components, according
   to the model proposed by Prebble, Addis, and Tippett (2013). (C) 2017

Abstract = {{In free visual exploration, eye-movement is immediately followed by
   dynamic reconfiguration of brain functional connectivity. We studied the
   task-dependency of this process in a combined visual search-change
   detection experiment. Participants viewed two (nearly) same displays in
   succession. First time they had to find and remember multiple targets
   among distractors, so the ongoing task involved memory encoding. Second
   time they had to determine if a target had changed in orientation, so
   the ongoing task involved memory retrieval. From multichannel EEG
   recorded during 200 ms intervals time-locked to fixation onsets, we
   estimated the functional connectivity using a weighted phase lag index
   at the frequencies of theta, alpha, and beta bands, and derived global
   and local measures of the functional connectivity graphs. We found
   differences between both memory task conditions for several network
   measures, such as mean path length, radius, diameter, closeness and
   eccentricity, mainly in the alpha band. Both the local and the global
   measures indicated that encoding involved a more segregated mode of
   operation than retrieval. These differences arose immediately after
   fixation onset and persisted for the entire duration of the lambda
   complex, an evoked potential commonly associated with early visual
   perception. We concluded that encoding and retrieval differentially
   shape network configurations involved in early visual perception,
   affecting the way the visual input is processed at each fixation. These
   findings demonstrate that task requirements dynamically control the
   functional connectivity networks involved in early visual perception.}},

Abstract = {{Autobiographical memory (AM) is multifaceted, incorporating the vivid

   large-scale AM networks. We used high angular resolution
   diffusion-weighted imaging and constrained spherical deconvolution-based
   tractography to assess white matter microstructure in 27 healthy young
   adult participants who were asked to recall past experiences using word
   cues. Inter-individual variation in the microstructure of the fornix
   (the main hippocampal input/output pathway) related to the amount of
   episodic, but not semantic, detail in AMs independent of memory age.
   Conversely, microstructure of the inferior longitudinal fasciculus,
   linking occipitotemporal regions with ATL, correlated with semantic, but
   not episodic, AMs. Further, these significant correlations remained when

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a debilitating age-related neurodegenerative

   of 137 AD, 78 mild (MCI) and 38 subjective cognitive impairment
   patients, and 355 healthy adults aged 18-78 years to identify
   dissociable multivariate morphological patterns sensitive to age and

   the sensitivity and diagnostic accuracy of the LICA patterns in relation

   high sensitivity to the diagnosis and cognitive status of AD, with
   different relationships with age: one reflected an anterior-posterior

   thickness and medial temporal lobe volume, respectively, also correlated
   significantly with age. Repeating the LICA decomposition and

Abstract = {{The goal of this study is to introduce a nonparametric technique for
   predicting conversion from Mild Cognitive impairment
   (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD). Progression of a slowly progressing
   disease such as AD benefits from the use of longitudinal data; however,
   research till now is limited due to the insufficient patient data and
   short follow-up time. A small dataset size invalidates the estimation of
   underlying disease progression model; hence, a supervised nonparametric
   method is proposed. While depicting a real-world setting, longitudinal
   data of three years are employed for training, whereas only the baseline
   visit's data is used for validation. The train set is preprocessed for
   extraction of two dense clusters representing the subjects who remain
   stable at MCI or progress to AD after three years of the baseline visit.
   Similarity between these clusters and the test point is calculated in
   Euclidean space. Multiple features from two modalities of biomarkers,
   i.e., neuropsychological measures (NM) and structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) morphometry are also analyzed. Due to the limited MCI
   dataset size (NM: 145, MRI: 52, NM+MRI: 29), leave-one-out cross
   validation setup is employed for performance evaluation. The algorithm
   performance is noted for both unimodal case and bimodal cases. Superior
   performance (accuracy: 89.66\%, sensitivity: 87.50\%, specificity:
   92.31\%, precision: 93.33\%) is delivered by multivariate predictors.
   Three notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Longitudinal data are
   more powerful than the temporal data, 2) MRI is a better predictor of
   MCI-to-AD conversion than NM, and 3) multivariate predictors outperform
   single predictor models.}},

Abstract = {{Tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) experiences increase with age and frequently
   heighten concerns about memory decline. We studied 73 clinically normal
   older adults participating in the Harvard Aging Brain Study. They
   completed a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task that
   required remembering names associated with pictures of famous faces.
   Older age was associated with more self-reported TOT experiences and a
   decrease in the percentage of remembered names. However, the percentage
   of TOT experiences and the percentage of remembered names were not
   directly correlated. We mapped fMRI activity for recollection of famous
   names and TOT and examined activity in the hippocampal formation,
   retrosplenial cortex, and lateral prefrontal cortex. The hippocampal
   formation was similarly activated in recollection and TOT experiences.
   In contrast, the retrosplenial cortex was most active for recollection
   and lateral prefrontal cortex was most active for TOT experiences.
   Together, the results confirm that age-related increases in TOT

Abstract = {{Early intervention in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) requires novel biomarkers
   that can capture changes in brain activity at an early stage. Current AD
   biomarkers are expensive and/or invasive and therefore unsuitable for
   use as screening tools, but a non-invasive, inexpensive, easily
   accessible screening method could be useful in both clinical and
   research settings. Prior studies suggest that especially
   paired-associate learning tasks may be useful in detecting the earliest
   memory impairment in AD. Here, we investigated the utility of functional
   Near Infrared Spectroscopy in measuring brain activity from prefrontal,
   parietal and temporal cortices of healthy adults (n = 19) during memory
   encoding and retrieval under a face-name paired-associate learning task.
   Our findings demonstrate that encoding of novel face-name pairs compared
   to baseline as well as compared to repeated face-name pairs resulted in
   significant activation in left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex while
   recalling resulted in activation in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
   bilaterally. Moreover, brain response to recalling was significantly
   higher than encoding in medial, superior and middle frontal cortices for
   novel faces. Overall, this study shows that fNIRS can reliably measure
   cortical brain activation during a face-name paired-associate learning
   task. Future work will include similar measurements in populations with
   progressing memory deficits.}},

Abstract = {{Patients with classic galactosemia, a genetic metabolic disorder,

   evaluate spontaneous functional connectivity during rest to investigate
   potential abnormalities in neural networks. We characterized networks
   using seed-based correlation analysis in 13 adolescent patients and 13
   matched controls. Results point towards alterations in several networks,
   including well-known resting-state networks (e.g. default mode,
   salience, visual network). Particularly, patients showed alterations in
   networks encompassing medial prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule and
   (pre)cuneus, involved in spatial orientation and attention. Furthermore,
   altered connectivity of networks including the insula and superior
   frontal gyrus -important for sensory-motor integration and motor
   (speech) planning- was demonstrated. Lastly, abnormalities were found in
   networks involving occipital regions, linked to visuospatial capacities
   and working memory. Importantly, across several seeds, altered
   functional connectivity to the superior frontal cortex, anterior insula,
   parietal lobule and the (pre)cuneus was observed in patients, suggesting
   special importance of these brain regions. Moreover, these alterations
   correlated with neurocognitive test results, supporting a relation with

Title = {{Lexical-Semantic Search Under Different Covert Verbal Fluency Tasks: An
   fMRI Study}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{11}},
Month = {{AUG 8}},
Abstract = {{Background: Verbal fluency is a measure of cognitive flexibility and
   word search strategies that is widely used to characterize impaired
   cognitive function. Despite the wealth of research on identifying and
   characterizing distinct aspects of verbal fluency, the anatomic and
   functional substrates of retrieval-related search and post-retrieval
   control processes still have not been fully elucidated.
   Methods: Twenty-one native English-speaking, healthy, right-handed,
   adult volunteers (mean age = 31 years; range = 21-45 years; 9 F) took
   part in a block-design functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging ((MRI)
   study of free recall, covert word generation tasks when guided by
   phonemic (P), semantic-category (C), and context-based fill-in the-blank
   sentence completion (S) cues. General linear model (GLM), Independent
   Component Analysis (ICA), and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) were
   used to further characterize the neural substrate of verbal fluency as a
   function of retrieval cue type.
   Results: Common localized activations across P, C. and S tasks occurred
   in the bilateral superior and left inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior
   cingulate cortex, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), and left
   insula. Differential task activations were centered in the occipital,
   temporal and parietal regions as well as the thalamus and cerebellum.
   The context-based fluency task, i.e., the S task, elicited higher
   differential brain activity in a lateralized frontal-temporal network
   typically engaged in complex language processing. P and C tasks elicited
   activation in limited pathways mainly within the left frontal regions.
   ICA and PPI results of the S task suggested that brain regions
   distributed across both hemispheres, extending beyond classical language
   areas, are recruited for lexical-semantic access and retrieval during
   sentence completion.
   Conclusion: Study results support the hypothesis of overlapping, as well
   as distinct, neural networks for covert word generation when guided by
   different linguistic cues. The increased demand on word retrieval is met
   by the concurrent recruitment of classical as well as non-classical
   language-related brain regions forming a large cognitive neural network.
   The retrieval-related search and post-retrieval control processes that
   subserve verbal fluency, therefore, reverberates across distinct
   functional networks as determined by respective task demands.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with
   the progressive dysfunction of cognitive ability. Previous research has
   indicated that the default mode network (DMN) is closely related to
   cognition and is impaired in Alzheimer's disease. Because recent studies
   have shown that different frequency bands represent specific
   physiological functions, DMN functional connectivity studies of the
   different frequency bands based on resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) data may
   provide new insight into AD pathophysiology. In this study, we explored
   the functional connectivity based on well-defined DMN regions of
   interest (ROIs) from the five frequency bands: slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz),
   slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz), slow-2 (0.198-0.25
   Hzs) and standard low-frequency oscillations (LFO) (0.01-0.08 Hz). We
   found that the altered functional connectivity patterns are mainly in
   the frequency band of slow-5 and slow-4 and that the decreased
   connections are long distance, but some relatively short connections are
   increased. In addition, the altered functional connections of the DMN in
   AD are frequency dependent and differ between the slow-5 and slow-4
   bands. Mini-Mental State Examination scores were significantly
   correlated with the altered functional connectivity patterns in the
   slow-5 and slow-4 bands. These results indicate that frequency-dependent
   functional connectivity changes might provide potential biomarkers for
   AD pathophysiology.}},

Abstract = {{Although commonly interpreted as a marker of episodic memory during
   neuropsychological exams, relatively little is known regarding the
   neurobehavior of ``total learning{''} immediate recall scores. Medial
   temporal lobes are clearly associated with delayed recall performances,
   yet immediate recall may necessitate networks beyond traditional
   episodic memory. We aimed to operationalize cognitive and neuroanatomic
   correlates of total immediate' recall in several aging syndromes.
   Demographically-matched neurologically normal adults (n = 91),
   individuals with Alzheimer's disease (n = 566), logopenic variant
   primary progressive aphasia (PPA) (n = 34), behavioral variant
   frontotemporal dementia (n = 97), semantic variant PPA (n = 71), or
   nonfluent/agrammatic variant PPA (n = 39) completed a neurocognitive
   battery, including the CVLT-Short Form trials 1-4 Total Immediate
   Recall; a majority subset also completed a brain MRI. Regressions
   covaried for age and sex, and MMSE in cognitive and total intracranial
   volume in neuroanatomic models. Neurologically normal adults
   demonstrated a heterogeneous pattern of cognitive associations with
   total immediate recall (executive, speed, delayed recall), such that no
   singular cognitive or neuroanatomic correlate uniquely predicted
   performance. Within the clinical cohorts, there were syndrome-specific
   cognitive and neural associations with total immediate recall; e.g.,
   semantic processing was the strongest cognitive correlate in svPPA
   (partial r = 0.41), while frontal volumes was the only meaningful neural
   correlate in bvFTD (partial r = 0.20). Medial temporal lobes were not
   independently associated with total immediate recall in any group (ps >
   0.05). Multiple neurobehavioral systems are associated with ``total
   learning{''} immediate recall scores that importantly differ across
   distinct clinical syndromes. Conventional memory networks may not be
   sufficient or even importantly contribute to total immediate recall in
   many syndromes. Interpreting learning scores as equivalent to episodic

Abstract = {{Tests of verbal fluency have been widely used to assess the cognitive
   functioning of persons, and are typically classified into two categories
   (semantic and phonological fluency). While widely-distributed divergent
   and convergent brain regions have been found to be involved in semantic

   comprehensive white-matter network associated with semantic and

   longitudinal fasciculus (SLF) and frontal aslant tract (FAT) were
   significantly correlated with the scores of both semantic and
   phonological fluencies. These effects persisted even when we rifled out
   the influence of potential confounding factors (e.g., total lesion
   volume). Moreover, the damage to the first three tracts caused
   additional impairments in the semantic compared to the phonological

Abstract = {{Traumatic stress patients showed significant improvement in behavior
   after a prolonged exposure to an unrelated stimulus. This treatment
   method attempts to promote extinction of the fear memory associated with
   the initial traumatic experience. However, the subsequent prolonged
   exposure to such stimulus creates an additional layer of neural stress.
   Although the mechanism remains unclear, prolonged exposure therapy (PET)
   likely involves changes in synaptic plasticity, neurotransmitter
   function and inflammation; especially in parts of the brain concerned
   with the formation and retrieval of fear memory (Hippocampus and
   Prefrontal Cortex: PFC). Since certain synaptic proteins are also
   involved in danger-associated molecular pattern signaling (DAMP), we
   identified the significance of IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKII alpha expression as a
   potential link between the concurrent progression of synaptic and
   inflammatory changes in stress. Thus, a comparison between
   IGF-1/IGF-1R/CaMKII alpha, synaptic and DAMP proteins in stress and PET
   may highlight the significance of PET on synaptic morphology and
   neuronal inflammatory response. In behaviorally characterized
   Sprague-Dawley rats, there was a significant decline in neural IGF-1 (p
   < 0.001), hippocampal (p < 0.001) and cortical (p < 0.05) IGF-1R
   expression. These animals showed a significant loss of presynaptic
   markers (synaptophysin; p < 0.001), and changes in neurotransmitters
   (VGLUT2, Tyrosine hydroxylase, GABA, ChAT). Furthermore, naive stressed
   rats recorded a significant decrease in post synaptic marker (PSD-95; p
   < 0.01) and synaptic regulator (CaMKII alpha; p < 0.001). As part of the
   synaptic response to a decrease in brain CaMKII alpha, small ion
   conductance channel (KCa2.2) was upregulated in the brain of naive
   stressed rats (p < 0.01). After a PET, an increase in IGF-1 (p < 0.05)
   and IGF-1R was recorded in the Stress-PET group (p < 0.001). As such,
   hippocampal (p < 0.001), but not cortical (ns) synaptophysin expression
   increased in Stress-PET. Although PSD-95 was relatively unchanged in the
   hippocampus and PFC, CaMKII alpha (p < 0.001) and KCa2.2 (p < 0.01) were
   upregulated in Stress-PET, and may be involved in extinction of fear
   memory-related synaptic potentials. These changes were also associated
   with a normalized neurotransmitter function, and a significant reduction
   in open space avoidance; when the animals were assessed in elevated plus
   maze (EPM). In addition to a decrease in IGF-1/IGF-1R, an increase in
   activated hippocampal and cortical microglia was seen in stress (p <
   0.05) and after a PET (Stress-PET; p < 0.001). Furthermore, this was
   linked with a significant increase in HMGB1 (Hippocampus: p < 0.001,
   PFC: p < 0.05) and TLR4 expression (Hippocampus: p < 0.01; PFC: ns) in
   the neurons. Taken together, this study showed that traumatic stress and
   subsequent PET involves an event dependent alteration of
   IGF1/IGF-1R/CaMKII alpha. Firstly, we showed a direct relationship
   between IGF-1/IGF-1R expression, presynaptic function (synaptophysin)
   and neurotransmitter activity in stress and PET. Secondly, we identified
   the possible role of CaMKII alpha in post-synaptic function and
   regulation of small ion conductance channels. Lastly, we highlighted
   some of the possible links between IGF1/IGF1R/CaMKII alpha, the
   expression of DAMP proteins, Microglia activation, and its implication
   on synaptic plasticity during stress and PET. (C) 2017 IBRO. Published

   decoupling in this network corresponded to greater day-to-day disability
   and mediated age-related declines in psychomotor speed. Finally,
   examination of network organization revealed a pattern of age-related
   dedifferentiation for the banks of the superior temporal sulcus, again
   present only with higher cholesterol. More specifically, age was related
   to decreasing within-module communication (indexed by Within-Module
   Degree Z-Score) and increasing between-module communication (indexed by
   Participation Coefficient), but only in participants with
   clinically-elevated cholesterol. Follow-up analyses indicated that all
   findings were driven by low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, rather
   than high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or triglycerides, which is
   interesting as LDL levels have been linked to increased risk for
   cardiovascular disease, whereas HDL levels appear inversely related to
   such disease. These findings provide novel insight into the deleterious
   effects of cholesterol on brain health and suggest that cholesterol
   accelerates the impact of age on neural trajectories by disrupting
   connectivity in circuits implicated in integrative processes and
   behavioral control. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Encoding information in reference to the self enhances subsequent memory
   for the source of this information. In healthy adults, self-referential
   processing has been proposed to be mediated by the cortical midline
   structures (CMS), with functional differentiation between
   anterior-ventral, anterior-dorsal and posterior regions. While both
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) and behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia
   (bvFTD) patients show source memory impairment, it remains unclear
   whether they show a typical memory advantage for self-referenced
   materials. We also sought to identify the neural correlates of this
   socalled `self-reference effect' (SRE) in these patient groups. The SRE
   paradigm was tested in AD (n = 16) and bvFTD (n = 22) patients and
   age-matched healthy controls (n = 17). In this task, participants
   studied pictures of common objects paired with one of two background
   scenes (sources) under self-reference or other-reference encoding
   instructions, followed by an item and source recognition memory test.
   Voxel-based morphometry was used to investigate correlations between SRE
   measures and regions of grey matter atrophy in the CMS. The behavioural
   results indicated that self-referential encoding did not ameliorate the
   significant source memory impairments in AD and bvFTD patients.
   Furthermore, the reduced benefit of self-referential relative to
   other-referential encoding was not related to general episodic memory
   deficits. Our imaging findings revealed that reductions in the SRE were
   associated with atrophy in the anterior-dorsal CMS across both patient
   groups, with additional involvement of the posterior CMS in AD and
   anterior-ventral CMS in bvFTD. These findings suggest that although the
   SRE is comparably reduced in AD and bvFTD, this arises due to
   impairments in different subcomponents of self-referential processing.

Abstract = {{Older adults (OA), relative to young adults (YA), exhibit age-related
   alterations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activity
   during associative encoding, which contributes to deficits in source
   memory. Yet, there are remarkable individual differences in brain health
   and memory performance among OA. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is one
   individual difference factor that may attenuate brain aging, and thereby
   contribute to enhanced source memory in OA. To examine this possibility,
   26 OA and 31 YA completed a treadmill-based exercise test to evaluate
   CRF (peak VO2) and fMRI to examine brain activation during a face-name
   associative encoding task. Our results indicated that in OA, peak VO2
   was positively associated with fMRI activity during associative encoding
   in multiple regions including bilateral prefrontal cortex, medial
   frontal cortex, bilateral thalamus and left hippocampus. Next, a
   conjunction analysis was conducted to assess whether CRF influenced
   age-related differences in fMRI activation. We classified OA as high or
   low CRF and compared their activation to YA. High fit OA (HFOA) showed
   fMRI activation more similar to YA than low fit OA (LFOA) (i.e., reduced
   age-related differences) in multiple regions including thalamus,
   posterior and prefrontal cortex. Conversely, in other regions, primarily
   in prefrontal cortex, HFOA, but not LFOA, demonstrated greater
   activation than YA (i.e., increased age-related differences). Further,
   fMRI activity in these brain regions was positively associated with
   source memory among OA, with a mediation model demonstrating that
   associative encoding activation in medial frontal cortex indirectly
   influenced the relationship between peak VO2 and subsequent source
   memory performance. These results indicate that CRF may contribute to
   neuroplasticity among OA, reducing age-related differences in some brain
   regions, consistent with the brain maintenance hypothesis, but
   accentuating age-differences in other regions, consistent with the brain
   compensation hypothesis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

   Objectives: The objective of this study was to evaluate resting-state
   striato-cortical connectivity in PD and Alzheimer's disease and assess
   their relation to cognitive outcomes. Groups with mild cognitive
   impairment as a result of different pathologies (PD vs. Alzheimer's
   disease) were also compared.
   Methods: Seed-based connectivity of the dorsal, middle, and ventral
   striatum was analyzed in 111 patients using functional MRI. The
   correlation between connectivity at regions of between-group differences
   and clinical outcomes was assessed.
   Results: Patients showed lower striatal connectivity than controls.
   Connectivity between the middle (associative) striatum and precuneus
   negatively correlated with executive functions in PD and with memory
   performance in Alzheimer's disease. PD with cognitive impairment showed
   decreased connectivity of the dorsal (motor) striatum when compared with

Abstract = {{Generative models focused on multifactorial causal mechanisms in brain
   disorders are scarce and generally based on limited data. Despite the
   biological importance of the multiple interacting processes, their
   effects remain poorly characterized from an integrative analytic
   perspective. Here, we propose a spatiotemporal multifactorial causal
   model (MCM) of brain (dis)organization and therapeutic intervention that
   accounts for local causal interactions, effects propagation via physical
   brain networks, cognitive alterations, and identification of optimum
   therapeutic interventions. In this article, we focus on describing the
   model and applying it at the population-based level for studying late
   onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). By interrelating six different
   neuroimaging modalities and cognitive measurements, this model
   accurately predicts spatiotemporal alterations in brain amyloid-beta (A
   beta) burden, glucose metabolism, vascular flow, resting state
   functional activity, structural properties, and cognitive integrity. The
   results suggest that a vascular dysregulation may be the most likely
   initial pathologic event leading to LOAD. Nevertheless, they also
   suggest that LOAD it is not caused by a unique dominant biological
   factor (e.g. vascular or A beta) but by the complex interplay among
   multiple relevant direct interactions. Furthermore, using theoretical
   control analysis of the identified population-based multi factorial
   causal network, we show the crucial advantage of using combinatorial
   over single-target treatments, explain why one-target A beta based
   therapies might fail to improve clinical outcomes, and propose an
   efficiency ranking of possible LOAD interventions. Although still
   requiring further validation at the individual level, this work presents
   the first analytic framework for dynamic multifactorial brain
   (dis)organization that may explain both the pathologic evolution of
   progressive neurological disorders and operationalize the influence of
   multiple interventional strategies.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, investigation into the cognitive and neural mechanisms

   paradigms incorporating wearable camera technology. By effortlessly
   capturing first-person images of one's life events, these cameras
   provide a rich set of naturalistic stimuli that can later be used to
   trigger the recall of specific episodes. Here, we chronicle the
   development and progression of such studies in behavioral and
   neuroimaging examinations of both clinical and nonclinical adult
   populations. Experiments examining the effects of periodic review of
   first-person images of life events have documented enhancements of

   cognitively healthy individuals may benefit as well. Findings from
   functional magnetic resonance imaging experiments using wearable camera
   stimuli as retrieval probes have produced results that, although largely
   consistent with the broader episodic memory literature, have
   significantly extended prior findings concerning the underlying mnemonic
   processes and the neural representation of autobiographical information.

Abstract = {{A somewhat perplexing finding in the systems neuroscience has been the

   Cost-efficiency analysis in the Power 264 data parcellation suggested

   developed in four stages. First, we used a voxel-based morphometry
   technique to investigate global and local gray matter (GM) atrophy in an
   AD group compared with healthy controls (HCs). Regions with significant
   GM volume reduction were segmented as volumes of interest (VOIs).
   Second, these VOIs were used to extract voxel values from the respective
   atrophy regions in AD, HC, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI)
   patient groups. The voxel values were then extracted into a feature
   vector. Third, at the feature-selection stage, all features were ranked
   according to their respective t-test scores and a genetic algorithm
   designed to find the optimal feature subset. The Fisher criterion was
   used as part of the objective function in the genetic algorithm.
   Finally, the classification was carried out using a support vector

Abstract = {{Background. Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit
   Function as Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex
   system based on Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract
   features of interest in computerized EEG through the analysis of few
   minutes of their EEC without any preliminary pre-processing. A proof of
   concept study previously published showed accuracy values ranging from
   94\%-98\% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment and/or
   Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence of deviant
   patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent
   with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted
   us in applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG
   signature of the disease.
   Aim of the study. The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this
   methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing
   ones.
   Methods. Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range
   7-14; mean value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males;
   6 females; age range 7-12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study.
   Patients received Autism diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria,
   subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. A segment of artefact-free EEG
   lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input values for subsequent
   analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented evolutionary
   system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an invariant
   features vector input of EEC on which supervised machine learning
   systems acted as blind classifiers.
   Results. The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in
   sorting out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to
   100\% with all kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol
   and to 84\% - 92.8\% using Leave One Out protocol. The similarities
   among the ANN weight matrixes measured with apposite algorithms were not
   affected by the age of the subjects. This suggests that the ANNs do not
   read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant features related to
   the brain's underlying disconnection signature.
   Conclusion. This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the
   development of non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection
   of ASD. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with a range of
   neuropsychological deficits, including attention, memory, and executive
   functioning attributable to diffuse axonal injury (DAI) with
   accompanying focal frontal and temporal damage. Although the memory
   deficit of TBI has been well characterized with laboratory tests,
   comparatively little research has examined retrograde autobiographical
   memory (AM) at the chronic phase of TBI, with no prior studies of
   unselected patients drawn directly from hospital admissions for trauma.
   Moreover, little is known about the effects of TBI on canonical episodic
   and non-episodic (e.g., semantic) AM processes. In the present study, we
   assessed the effects of chronic-phase TBI on AM in patients with focal
   and DAI spanning the range of TBI severity. Patients and socioeconomic-
   and age-matched controls were administered the Autobiographical
   Interview (AI) (Levine, Svoboda, Hay, Winocur, \& Moscovitch, 2002) a
   widely used method for dissociating episodic and semantic elements of
   AM, along with tests of neuropsychological and functional outcome.
   Measures of episodic and non-episodic AM were compared with regional
   brain volumes derived from high-resolution structural magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). Severe TBI (but not mild or moderate TBI) was associated
   with reduced recall of episodic autobiographical details and increased
   recall of non-episodic details relative to healthy comparison
   participants. There were no significant associations between AM
   performance and neuropsychological or functional outcome measures.
   Within the full TBI sample, autobiographical episodic memory was
   associated with reduced volume distributed across temporal, parietal,
   and prefrontal regions considered to be part of the brain's AM network.
   These results suggest that TBI-related distributed volume loss affects
   episodic autobiographical recollection. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Studies in mice using resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (rs-fMRI) have provided opportunities to investigate the effects
   of pharmacological manipulations on brain function and map the
   phenotypes of mouse models of human brain disorders. Mouse rs-fMRI is
   typically performed under anaesthesia, which induces both regional
   suppression of brain activity and disruption of large-scale neural
   networks. Previous comparative studies using rodents investigating
   various drug effects on long-distance functional connectivity (FC) have
   reported agent-specific FC patterns, however, effects of regional
   suppression are sparsely explored. Here we examined changes in regional
   connectivity under six different anaesthesia conditions using mouse
   rsfMRI with the goal of refining the framework of understanding the
   brain activation under anaesthesia at a local level. Regional
   homogeneity (ReHo) was used to map local synchronization in the brain,
   followed by analysis of several brain areas based on ReHo maps. The
   results revealed high local coherence in most brain areas. The primary
   somatosensory cortex and caudate-putamen showed agent-specific
   properties. Lower local coherence in the cingulate cortex was observed
   under medetomidine, particularly when compared to the combination of
   medetomidine and isoflurane. The thalamus was associated with retained
   local coherence across anaesthetic levels and multiple nuclei. These
   results show that anaesthesia induced by the investigated anaesthetics
   through different molecular targets promote agent-specific regional
   connectivity. In addition, ReHo is a data-driven method with minimum
   user interaction, easy to use and fast to compute. Given that
   examination of the brain at a local level is widely applied in human
   rs-fMRI studies, our results show its sensitivity to extract information
   on varied neuronal activity under six different regimens relevant to
   mouse functional imaging. These results, therefore, will inform future
   rs-fMRI studies on mice and the type of anaesthetic agent used, and will
   help to bridge observations between this burgeoning research field and
   ongoing human research across analytical scales.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has
   continued development and standardization of methodologies for
   biomarkers and has provided an increased depth and breadth of data
   available to qualified researchers. This review summarizes the over 400
   publications using ADNI data during 2014 and 2015.
   Methods: We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data.
   Results: (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes
   to hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of
   hippocampus, and disruption to functional networks, are detectable in
   presymptomatic subjects before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with
   abnormal beta-amyloid deposition (A beta+), biomarkers become abnormal
   in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade hypothesis; (3) Cognitive
   decline is more closely linked to tau than A beta deposition; (4)
   Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with A beta to increase
   white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different
   patterns of atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and
   executive function and may underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6)
   Structural, functional, and metabolic network connectivities are
   disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of A beta
   pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical A beta
   deposition and declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and
   protective gene loci have been identified using biologically informed
   approaches; (8) Cognitively normal and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   subjects are heterogeneous and include groups typified not only by
   ``classic{''} AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers, accelerated
   decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of
   subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more
   pathologies improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of
   cognitive outcome measures to early changes in cognition has been
   improved and surrogate outcome measures using longitudinal structural
   magnetic resonance imaging may further reduce clinical trial cost and
   duration; (11) Advances in machine learning techniques such as neural
   networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic accuracy especially in
   challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network connectivity
   measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal classification
   and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling multimodal
   classifiers.
   Discussion: Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our
   understanding of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which
   in turn informs and improves clinical trial design. (C) 2017 Published

Title = {{Deep ensemble learning of sparse regression models for brain disease
   diagnosis}},
Journal = {{MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{37}},
Pages = {{101-113}},
Month = {{APR}},
Abstract = {{Recent studies on brain imaging analysis witnessed the core roles of
   machine learning techniques in computer-assisted intervention for brain
   disease diagnosis. Of various machine-learning techniques, sparse
   regression models have proved their effectiveness in handling
   high-dimensional data but with a small number of training samples,
   especially in medical problems. In the meantime, deep learning methods
   have been making great successes by outperforming the state-of-the-art
   performances in various applications. In this paper, we propose a novel
   framework that combines the two conceptually different methods of sparse
   regression and deep learning for Alzheimer's disease/mild cognitive
   impairment diagnosis and prognosis. Specifically, we first train
   multiple sparse regression models, each of which is trained with
   different values of a regularization control parameter. Thus, our
   multiple sparse regression models potentially select different feature
   subsets from the original feature set; thereby they have different
   powers to predict the response values, i.e., clinical label and clinical
   scores in our work. By regarding the response values from our sparse
   regression models as target-level representations, we then build a deep
   convolutional neural network for clinical decision making, which thus we
   call `Deep Ensemble Sparse Regression Network.' To our best knowledge,
   this is the first work that combines sparse regression models with deep
   neural network. In our experiments with the ADNI cohort, we validated
   the effectiveness of the proposed method by achieving the highest
   diagnostic accuracies in three classification tasks. We also rigorously
   analyzed our results and compared with the previous studies on the ADNI
   cohort in the literature. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   first outlined in now classic work by Turing (1952), who showed
   computationally that diffusion of two or more tissue chemicals or
   ``morphogens{''} reacting across an embryonic cellular network is
   sufficient to scale initial random fluctuations into stable, often
   strikingly asymmetric patterns. Here we propose that Turing's theory

Abstract = {{Abnormal neural activities can be revealed by resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) using analyses of the regional
   activity and functional connectivity (FC) of the networks in the brain.
   This study was designed to demonstrate the functional network

   we recruited 45 patients with unilateral PT in the early stage of
   disease (less than 48 months of disease duration) and 45 normal
   controls. We used regional homogeneity (ReHo) and seed-based FC
   computational methods to reveal resting-state brain activity features
   associated with pulsatile tinnitus. Compared with healthy controls, PT
   patients showed regional abnormalities mainly in the left middle
   occipital gyrus (MOG), posterior cingulate gyrus (PCC), precuneus and
   right anterior insula (AI). When these regions were defined as seeds, we
   demonstrated widespread modification of interaction between the auditory
   and non-auditory networks. The auditory network was positively connected
   with the cognitive control network (CCN), which may associate with
   tinnitus related distress. Both altered regional activity and changed FC
   were found in the visual network. The modification of interactions of
   higher order networks were mainly found in the DMN, CCN and limbic
   networks. Functional connectivity between the left MOG and left

Abstract = {{Introduction: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) increase the risk of

   Method: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and WMH were
   assessed in 78 subjects with increased amyloid levels on AV-45 positron
   emission tomography (PET) in different clinical stages of AD. We tested
   the association between WMH volume in major atlas-based fiber tract

   between the tracts' projection areas within the default mode network
   (DMN).
   Results: WMH volume within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus
   (IFOF) was the highest among all tract ROIs and associated with reduced
   FC in IFOF-connected DMN areas, independently of global AV-45 PET.
   Higher AV-45 PET contributed to reduced FC in IFOF-connected, temporal,

Volume = {{33}},

Abstract = {{The purpose of this paper is to present a new approach for inter-subject
   non-rigid registration of 3D MR brain images which could assist in
   automatic labeling of brain structures. A physical dynamic elasticity
   model (DEM) is developed which tends to represent the complex non-linear
   deformations as elastic waves. The transformation is governed by
   elastodynamics wave equation. The registration process ensues in a
   hierarchical fashion, thus reducing the risk of obtaining a local
   optimal transformation. Along with the correction of local
   misalignments, it also removes global shape differences without any
   prior initialization. The proposed scheme was compared against high
   ranking registration methods including: DROP, SyN, ART and DRAMMS. The
   results were quantitatively analyzed by computing and testing the
   statistical significance of the volume overlap measures and Hausdorff
   distance for segmented structures with DROP, SyN, ART, DRAMMS and DEM
   registration methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed
   DEM registration method leads to very promising results when applied to
   the problem of inter-subject registration and that favorably compares
   against classical registration approaches. Since DEM registration method
   is able to reduce registration errors significantly, hence it could be
   used to automatically label the anatomical structures for clinical
   studies. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{A novel technique of quantitative EEG for differentiating patients with
   early-stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from other forms of rapidly
   progressive dementia (RPD) is proposed. The discrimination is based on
   the extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency
   representation of the EEG signals through continuous wavelet transform
   (CWT). An average measure of complexity of the EEG signal obtained by
   permutation entropy (PE) is also included. The dimensionality of the
   feature space is reduced through a multilayer processing system based on
   the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The DL processor
   includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning
   techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a
   supervised way by associating the known category labels to the reduced
   vector of high-level features generated by the previous processing
   blocks. The supervised learning step is carried out by using either
   support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer neural networks (MLP-NN). A
   subset of EEG from patients suffering from Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and
   healthy controls (HC) is considered for differentiating CJD patients.
   When fine-tuning the parameters of the global processing system by a
   supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able to achieve an
   average accuracy of 89\%, an average sensitivity of 92\%, and an average
   specificity of 89\% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are
   obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive reserve (CR) prevents cognitive decline and delays
   neurodegeneration. Recent epidemiological evidence suggests that
   lifelong bilingualism may act as CR delaying the onset of dementia by
   similar to 4.5 y. Much controversy surrounds the issue of bilingualism
   and its putative neuroprotective effects. We studied brain metabolism, a
   direct index of synaptic function and density, and neural connectivity
   to shed light on the effects of bilingualism in vivo in Alzheimer's
   dementia (AD). Eighty-five patients with probable AD and matched for
   disease duration (45 German-Italian bilingual speakers and 40
   monolingual speakers) were included. Notably, bilingual individuals were
   on average 5 y older than their monolingual peers. In agreement with our
   predictions and with models of CR, cerebral hypometabolism was more
   severe in the group of bilingual individuals with AD. The metabolic
   connectivity analyses crucially supported the neuroprotective effect of
   bilingualism by showing an increased connectivity in the executive
   control and the default mode networks in the bilingual, compared with
   the monolingual, AD patients. Furthermore, the degree of lifelong
   bilingualism (i.e., high, moderate, or low use) was significantly
   correlated to functional modulations in crucial neural networks,
   suggesting both neural reserve and compensatory mechanisms. These
   findings indicate that lifelong bilingualism acts as a powerful CR proxy
   in dementia and exerts neuroprotective effects against
   neurodegeneration. Delaying the onset of dementia is a top priority of

Title = {{Ventromedial prefrontal cortex generates pre-stimulus theta coherence
   desynchronization: A schema instantiation hypothesis}},
Journal = {{CORTEX}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{87}},
Pages = {{16-30}},
Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{The ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) has long been implicated in
   monitoring of memory veracity, and more recently also in memory schema
   functions. In our model of strategic retrieval the two are related. We
   have proposed that the vmPFC has two schema dependent functions: (i) to
   establish context-relevant templates against which the output of memory
   systems can be compared; (ii) to mediate automatic decision monitoring
   processes to ensure that only those responses that meet the criterion
   are enacted. Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were used to provide
   evidence that vmPFC supports both functions, and that schema
   instantiation informs monitoring. Participants viewed pictures of
   acquaintances, along with those of famous and nonfamous people, and were
   asked to respond positively only to pictures of individuals they had met
   (personal familiarity). The Self serves as a super-ordinate cognitive
   schema, facilitating accurate endorsement of acquaintances and exclusion
   of non-personal but familiar faces. For the present report we focused on
   pre-cue tonic oscillatory activity. Controls demonstrated theta
   coherence desynchronization between medial prefrontal areas,
   inferotemporal and lateral temporal cortices. These oscillatory
   coherence patterns were significantly reduced in patients with vmPFC
   damage, especially in those with clinical histories of spontaneous
   confabulation. Importantly, these pre-stimulus cortico-cortical
   desynchronizations predicted post-cue automatic memory activation, as
   indexed by a familiarity modulation of the face-sensitive posterior
   cortical N170. Pre-cue desynchronization also predicted early post-cue
   frontal positive modulation (P230) and response accuracy. The data are
   consistent with a schema instantiation model that suggests the vmPFC
   biases posterior neocortical long-term memory representations that
   enhance automatic memory cue processing and informs frontally-mediated
   rapid memory monitoring (P230). Damage to these structures can lead to
   inaccurate, context irrelevant activation of schemas. These, in turn,
   impair monitoring signals and can lead to confabulation when memory
   control processes are also deficient. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Confabulatory phenomena are rare in the early stage of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), are often provoked and are triggered by questions or in
   response to neuropsychological testing. In this retrospective study
   functional connectivity alterations were investigated for the first time
   in a group of patients with early AD who had shown evidence of verbal
   and nonverbal confabulatory tendencies. Resting-state functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans of 18 confabulating patients
   were compared with those of 18 non confabulators. The finding showed
   that confabulators had decreased connectivity between a seed region in
   the right inferolateral frontal cortex and right mediotemporal and
   insular regions, and increased connectivity with frontal areas and a
   homologous region on the left. The seed control region in the left
   inferolateral frontal cortex showed increased connectivity with midline
   frontal and anterior cingulate regions, while a decrease was found in
   temporal areas. Confabulatory tendencies appear in early AD as a result
   of disconnection between crucial computational hubs in frontal and

   of up-regulation of frontal activity, and especially of midline and

Title = {{Robustness and dynamicity of functional networks in phantom sound}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{146}},
Pages = {{171-187}},
Month = {{FEB 1}},
Abstract = {{Phantom sound perception is the perception of a sound in the absence of
   a corresponding external sound source. It is a common symptom for which
   no treatment exists. Gaining a better understanding of its
   pathophysiology by applying network science might help in identifying
   targets in the brain for neuromodulatory approaches to treat this
   elusive symptom. Brain networks are commonly organized as functional
   modules which have a densely connected core network coupled to a
   communally-organized peripheral network. The core network is called the
   rich club network and the peripheral network is divided into the feeder
   and local networks. In current study, we investigate the effects of
   virtual lesions on the endogenous dynamics, complexity and robustness of
   the remaining brain. It is hypothesized that depending on whether nodes
   is functionally central to the network or not, the robustness and
   dynamics of the network change when a lesion in introduced. We therefore
   investigate the effect of introducing a virtual focal lesion randomly to
   different nodes is in the tinnitus network and contrast it to the effect
   of specifically targeting the nodes of the rich-club, feeder and local
   nodes in patients experiencing a phantom sound (i.e. tinnitus). The
   tinnitus and control networks were computed from the source-localized
   EEG of 311 tinnitus patients and 256 control subjects. The results of
   the current study indicate that both the tinnitus and control networks
   are robust to the attack on random and rich club nodes, but are
   drastically modified when attacked from the periphery, especially while
   targeting the feeder hubs. In both the tinnitus and control networks,
   feeder nodes were found to have a higher betweenness centrality value
   than the rich club nodes. This shows that the feeders have a larger
   influence on the information transmission through the brain than the
   rich club nodes, by transferring information from the peripheral
   communities to the core. Further, evidence for the theoretical model of
   a multimodal tinnitus network is also presented showing that the
   tinnitus network is divided into individual, separable modules each
   possibly encoding a different aspect of tinnitus. The current study
   alludes to the concept that the efficient modification of the tinnitus
   network is theoretically possible by disconnecting the individual
   communities from the core of the pathological network. (C) 2016 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate associations between neuroimaging markers of
   cerebrovascular disease, including lesion topography and extent and
   severity of strategic and global cerebral tissue injury, and cognition
   in carotid artery disease (CAD).
   Materials and Methods: All participants gave written informed consent to
   undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke's Cognitive
   Examination-Revised. One hundred eight patients with symptomatic CAD but
   no dementia were included, and a score less than 82 represented
   cognitive impairment. Group comparison and interrelations between global
   cognitive and fluency performance, lesion topography, and
   ultrastructural damage were assessed with voxelbased statistics.
   Associations between cognition, medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA),
   lesion volumes, and global white matter ultrastructural damage indexed
   as increased mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by
   controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers selected
   from a multivariate prediction model was tested with receiver operating
   characteristic analysis.
   Results: Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 {[}49.1\%], classified as
   having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older than nonimpaired
   patients (P =.027) and had more frequent MTA (P< .001), more cortical
   infarctions (P =.016), and larger volumes of acute (P =.028) and chronic
   (P =.009) subcortical ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not correlate
   with global cognitive performance (lacunar infarctions, P =.060; acute
   lesions, P =.088; chronic subcortical ischemic lesions, P =.085). In
   contrast, cognitive performance correlated with presence of chronic
   ischemic lesions within the interhemispheric tracts and thalamic
   radiation (P< .05, false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton mean
   diffusivity showed the closest correlation with cognition (R-2 = 0.311,
   P< .001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cognitive
   disorder (area under the curve, 0.82 {[}95\% confidence interval: 0.75,
   0.90]). Findings were confirmed in subjects with a low risk of
   preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by the absence of MTA (n = 85).
   Conclusion: Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion locations and
   severity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive
   impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that subcortical
   disconnection within large-scale cognitive neural networks is a key
   mechanism of vascular cognitive disorder.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{JAN 26}},
Abstract = {{Previous evidence showed a 75.5\% best accuracy in the classification of
   120 Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients with dementia and 100 matched
   normal elderly (Nold) subjects based on cortical source current density
   and linear lagged connectivity estimated by eLORETA freeware from
   resting state eyes-closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms
   (Babiloni et al., 2016a). Specifically, that accuracy was reached using
   the ratio between occipital delta and alpha1 current density for a
   linear univariate classifier (receiver operating characteristic curves).
   Here we tested an innovative approach based on an artificial neural
   network (ANN) classifier from the same database of rsEEG markers.
   Frequency bands of interest were delta (24 Hz), theta (48 Hz Hz), alpha1
   (810.5 Hz), and alpha2 (10.513 Hz). ANN classification showed an
   accuracy of 77\% using the most 4 discriminative rsEEG markers of source
   current density (parietal theta/alpha 1, temporal theta/alpha 1,
   occipital theta/alpha 1, and occipital delta/alpha 1). It also showed an
   accuracy of 72\% using the most 4 discriminative rsEEG markers of source
   lagged linear connectivity (inter-hemispherical occipital delta/alpha 2,
   intra-hemispherical right parietal-limbic alpha 1, intra-hemispherical
   left occipital-temporal theta/alpha 1, intra-hemispherical right
   occipital-temporal theta/alpha 1). With these 8 markers combined, an
   accuracy of at least 76\% was reached. Interestingly, this accuracy
   based on 8 (linear) rsEEG markers as inputs to ANN was similar to that
   obtained with a single rsEEG marker (Babiloni et al., 2016a), thus
   unveiling their information redundancy for classification purposes. In
   future AD studies, inputs to ANNs should include other classes of
   independent linear (i.e., directed transfer function) and non-linear
   (i.e., entropy) rsEEG markers to improve the classification.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders has
   gained increasing attention in recent years. Using a variety of
   neuroimaging modalities such as structural, functional and diffusion
   MRI, along with machine learning techniques, hundreds of studies have
   been carried out for accurate classification of patients with
   heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as
   schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been
   published during the past quarter century on single subject prediction
   focused on a multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study,
   we provide a survey of more than 200 reports in this field with a focus
   on schizophrenia, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease
   (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum disease (ASD) and
   attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed information
   about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted
   features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our
   knowledge, this is by far the most comprehensive review of
   neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders. In the
   second part, we present our opinion on major pitfalls of those studies
   from a machine learning point of view. Common biases are discussed and
   suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such as
   decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential
   diagnosis, disease subtype classification and deep learning are also
   discussed. Based on this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the
   great potential of neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of
   various disorders. However, the main bottleneck of this exciting field
   is still the limited sample size, which could be potentially addressed
   by modern data sharing models such as the ones discussed in this paper.
   Emerging big data technologies and advanced data-intensive machine
   learning methodologies such as deep learning have coincided with an
   increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single subject
   prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time. In this report,
   we survey the past and offer some opinions regarding the road ahead. (C)

Abstract = {{Introduction: Selective hippocampal (HC) subfield atrophy has been
   reported in older adults with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's
   disease. The goal of this study was to investigate the associations
   between the volume of hippocampal subfields and visual and verbal
   episodic memory in cognitively normal older adults.
   Methods: This study was conducted on a subset of 133 participants from
   the Einstein Aging Study (EAS), a community-based study of non-demented
   older adults systematically recruited from the Bronx, N.Y. All
   participants completed comprehensive EAS neuropsychological assessment.
   Visual episodic memory was assessed using the Complex Figure Delayed
   Recall subtest from the Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of
   Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). Verbal episodic memory was assessed
   using Delayed Recall from the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
   (FCSRT). All participants underwent 3T MRI brain scanning with
   subsequent automatic measurement of the hemispheric hippocampal subfield
   volumes (CA1, CA2-CA3, CA4-dente gyrus, presubiculum, and subiculum). We
   used linear regressions to model the association between hippocampal
   subfield volumes and visual and verbal episodic memory tests while
   adjusting for age, sex, education, and total intracranial volume.
   Results: Participants had a mean age of 78.9 (SD = 5.1) and 60.2\% were
   female. Total hippocampal volume was associated with Complex Figure
   Delayed Recall (beta = 0.31, p = 0.001) and FCSRT Delayed Recall (beta =
   0.27, p = 0.007); subiculum volume was associated with Complex Figure
   Delayed Recall (beta =0.27, p = 0.002) and FCSRT Delayed Recall (beta =
   0.24, p = 0.010); CA1 was associated with Complex Figure Delayed Recall
   (beta = 0.26, p < 0.002) and FCSRT Delayed Recall (beta = 0.20, p =
   0.025).
   Conclusions: Our findings confirm previous research on the specific
   roles of CA1 and subiculum in episodic memory. Our results suggest that
   hippocampal subfields have sensitive roles in the process of visual and
   verbal episodic memory. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The anterior hippocampus has been implicated in associative memory, and
   along with hippocampal volume, this type of memory declines with age.
   However, few cross-sectional studies include middle-aged samples, making
   it unclear at what point these age-related changes occur. In addition,
   although men and women have been shown to differ in associative memory
   and rates of age-related hippocampal atrophy, sex-differences in aging
   are rarely studied. To address these issues, we assessed memory for
   word-pairs, hippocampal volume and activation during encoding and
   retrieval, across middle-aged (n=39) and older (n = 44) participants,
   specifically in relation to sex. Older adults showed significantly
   poorer associative memory compared to middle-aged adults, paralleled by
   smaller anterior hippocampi and less activation during successful
   retrieval. The age-by-sex interaction observed in memory performance was
   also mirrored in the volume and activation of the hippocampus,
   indicating more pronounced age-effects in men as compared to women.
   These results indicate a specific role of the anterior hippocampus in
   verbal associative memory and suggest they both decline between
   middle-age and older age. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic memory is a conglomerate of autobiographical events, times,
   places, associated emotions, and other contextual who, what, when,
   where, why knowledge that can be explicitly stated. It is the collection
   of past personal experiences that occurred at a particular time and
   place. An emotion plays a pivotal role in the formation of memory; it
   can either enhance memory or impair cognition. Memory plays a crucial
   role in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Dementia.
   Analyzing the retrieval of memory helps in better understanding of the
   disorders. The main aim of this paper is to find an integrated
   relationship between different regions of brain and the episodic memory
   recall, through functional connectivity parameters such as coherence,
   direct transfer function (DTF), partial directed coherence (PDC) for
   four different emotions namely fear, happy, anger and gratefulness. It
   was observed that there was a significant variation in DTF and PDC of
   temporal and frontopolar regions during retrieval of angry and fear
   events in theta and beta bands.}},

Abstract = {{Detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) from neuroimaging data such as MRI
   through machine learning have been a subject of intense research in
   recent years. Recent success of deep learning in computer vision have
   progressed such research further. However, common limitations with such
   algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and
   requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep
   networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer
   learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG and Inception
   are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets
   consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is
   re-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image
   entropy to select the most informative slices for training. Through
   experimentation on the OASIS MRI dataset, we show that with training
   size almost 10 times smaller than the state-of-the-art, we reach
   comparable or even better performance than current deep-learning based
   methods.}},

Abstract = {{In the recent years, deep learning has gained huge fame in solving
   problems from various fields including medical image analysis. This work
   proposes a deep convolutional neural network based pipeline for the
   diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and its stages using magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI) scans. Alzheimer's disease causes permanent damage to the
   brain cells associated with memory and thinking skills. The diagnosis of
   Alzheimer's in elderly people is quite difficult and requires a highly
   discriminative feature representation for classification due to similar
   brain patterns and pixel intensities. Deep learning techniques are
   capable of learning such representations from data. In this paper, a
   4-way classifier is implemented to classify Alzheimer's (AD), mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI), late mild cognitive impairment (LMCI) and
   healthy persons. Experiments are performed using ADNI dataset on a high
   performance graphical processing unit based system and new
   state-of-the-art results are obtained for multiclass classification of
   the disease. The proposed technique results in a prediction accuracy of
   98.8\%, which is a noticeable increase in accuracy as compared to the
   previous studies and clearly reveals the effectiveness of the proposed
   method.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive and irreversible brain
   degenerative disorder which often happens in people aged more than 65
   years old. Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient
   care and development of future treatment. Positrons Emission Tomography
   (PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be a
   powerful tool to help understand the brain changes related to AD. Most
   existing methods extract the handcraft features from images, and then
   train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. The success of
   these computer-aided diagnosis methods highly depends on the image
   preprocessing, including rigid registration and segmentation. Motivated
   by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper
   proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D
   convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN),
   which learns the features of 3D PET images by decomposing the 3D image
   into a sequence of 2D slices. In this framework, the hierarchical 2D
   CNNs are built to capture the intra-slice features while the gated
   recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is used to extract the inter-slice features
   for final classification. No rigid image registration and segmentation
   are required for PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline PET
   images from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive
   impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease
   Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that
   the proposed method achieves an AUC of 95.28\% for classification of AD
   vs. NC and 83.90\% for classification of MCI vs. NC, respectively,
   demonstrating the promising classification performance.}},

Abstract = {{The paper proposes a new approach to model human working memory using
   EEG-induced fuzzy associative memory and attempts to recover the encoded
   memory information from partially supplied instances during memory
   recall tasks. Experiments are performed to obtain EEG features from the
   temporal lobe, representing working memory input and pre-frontal lobe,
   representing the working memory output during memory encoding process of
   unknown peoples' face. The fuzzy associative memory is built up with
   these input-output features of the working memory, acquired for multiple
   instances. During the recall cycle, we use a notion of fuzzy inverse
   formulation to recall the input EEG instances from the supplied output
   instances of the working memory using fuzzy associative memory, when the
   subject is asked to remember the original face from its part, and to our
   great surprise the model produced input instances match with actual
   brain-generated input instances with small error. This signifies the
   importance of the proposed working memory model and inverse formulation
   in memory retrieval process. Experiments undertaken reveal that the

Abstract = {{Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measures the
   decline in the regional cerebral metabolic rate for glucose, offering a
   reliable metabolic biomarker even on presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) patients. PET scans provide functional information that is unique
   and unavailable using other types of imaging. However, the computational
   efficacy of FDG-PET data alone, for the classification of various
   Alzheimers Diagnostic categories, has not been well studied. This
   motivates us to correctly discriminate various AD Diagnostic categories
   using FDG-PET data. Deep learning has improved state-of-the-art
   classification accuracies in the areas of speech, signal, image, video,
   text mining and recognition. We propose novel methods that involve
   probabilistic principal component analysis on max-pooled data and
   mean-pooled data for dimensionality reduction, and multilayer feed
   forward neural network which performs binary classification. Our
   experimental dataset consists of baseline data of subjects including 186
   cognitively unimpaired (CU) subects, 336 mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   subjects with 158 Late MCI and 178 Early MCI, and 146 AD patients from

   F1-measure, precision, recall, negative and positive predictive values
   with a 10-fold cross validation scheme. Our results indicate that our
   designed classifiers achieve competitive results while max pooling
   achieves better classification performance compared to mean-pooled
   features. Our deep model based research may advance FDG-PET analysis by
   demonstrating their potential as an effective imaging biomarker of AD.}},

   same coordinates as the loss mask were transformed into a vector. The
   voxel values corresponding to the same point as the loss point were
   ranked by t-test and the most significant coordinate values were ranked.
   After this ranking, classification was done with support vector machines

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Noninvasive transcranial stimulation methods have been
   increasingly employed in order to improve cognitive performance in
   neurological patients. In previous studies with both stroke patients and
   healthy subjects, noninvasive stimulation of temporal-parietal regions
   and their homologue produced an improvement in linguistic
   tasks.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the current study was to evaluate if anodal
   transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over Brodmann areas 39/40
   (angular and supramarginal gyri) could promote the recovery of
   linguistic functions, in particular comprehension and naming, in a
   single patient affected by dementia.METHODS: Three preliminary
   explorative single sessions (right-side anodal, left-side anodal and
   sham tDCS) were carried out (Experiment 1). This procedure allows
   targeting the more effective site of stimulation for the treatment.
   Subsequently, we carried out a five-days tDCS treatment on the selected
   hemisphere (Experiment 2).RESULTS: We report verb comprehension
   amelioration after 5 days of anodal tDCS over the right BAs 39/40
   compared with the placebo tDCS. This result is maintained until two
   weeks after the end of the 5-days treatment.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
   provide new evidence for the therapeutic use of tDCS in degenerative
   diseases, suggesting that an explorative study can be useful for
   targeting the more appropriate stimulation site, and confirm the
   involvement of right-sided areas associated with language activities.}},

Abstract = {{Classifying neurodegenerative brain diseases in MRI aims at correctly
   assigning discrete labels to MRI scans. Such labels usually refer to a
   diagnostic decision a learner infers based on what it has learned from a
   training sample of MRI scans. Classification from MRI voxels separately
   typically does not provide independent evidence towards or against a
   class; the information relevant for classification is only present in
   the form of complicated multivariate patterns (or ``features{''}). Deep
   learning solves this problem by learning a sequence of non-linear
   transformations that result in feature representations that are better
   suited to classification. Such learned features have been shown to
   drastically outperform hand-engineered features in computer vision and
   audio analysis domains. However, applying the deep learning approach to
   the task of MRI classification is extremely challenging, because it
   requires a very large amount of data which is currently not available.
   We propose to instead use a three dimensional scattering transform,
   which resembles a deep convolutional neural network but has no learnable
   parameters. Furthermore, the scattering transform linearizes
   diffeomorphisms (due to e.g. residual anatomical variability in MRI
   scans), making the different disease states more easily separable using
   a linear classifier. In experiments on brain morphometry in Alzheimer's
   disease, and on white matter microstructural damage in HIV, scattering
   representations are shown to be highly effective for the task of disease
   classification. For instance, in semi-supervised learning of progressive
   versus stable MCI, we reach an accuracy of 82.7\%. We also present a
   visualization method to highlight areas that provide evidence for or
   against a certain class, both on an individual and group level. (C) 2017

Abstract = {{Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in
   pre-clinical stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals
   with risk factors for AD exhibit altered brain function several decades
   prior to the onset of AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related
   fMRI study of spatial context memory we tested the hypothesis that
   middle-aged adults (MA; 40-58 yrs) with a family history of late onset
   AD (MA(+FH)), or a combined + FH and apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 allele
   risk factors for AD (MA(+ FH + APOE4)), will exhibit differences in
   encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to - FH - APOE4
   MA controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will
   exhibit distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and
   memory performance, compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we
   conducted multivariate task, and behavior, partial least squares
   analysis of fMRI data obtained during successful context encoding and
   retrieval. Our results indicate that even though there were no
   significant group differences in context memory performance, there were
   significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior
   correlations involving the hippocampus, inferior parietal cortex,
   cingulate, and precuneus cortex in MA with AD risk factors, compared to
   controls. In addition, we observed that brain activity and
   brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in ventral visual
   cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and from
   MA(controls). Our results indicate that functional differences in
   episodic memory-related regions are present by early midlife in adults

Journal = {{ADVANCES IN ELECTRICAL AND COMPUTER ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{17}},

Pages = {{113-122}},
Abstract = {{The main objective of our research is to introduce an approach that uses
   noninvasive MRI images to predict the conversion from mild cognitive
   impairment to Alzheimer's disease at an early stage. It detects normal
   controls that are likely to develop Alzheimer's disease and mild
   cognitive impairment patients that are likely to establish Alzheimer's
   disease within two years or, contrarily, their stage remains same. The
   proposed approach uses two types of features i.e. volumetric features
   and textural features. Volumetric features consist of volume of grey
   matter, volume of white matter and volume of cerebrospinal fluid. A
   total of 364 textural features have been calculated. To avoid the curse
   of dimensionality, textural features are reduced to 15 features using
   gain ratio, a ranking based search algorithm. All features are tested
   against four classifiers i.e. AODEsr, VFI, RBF and LBR. Leave-One-Out
   cross validation strategy is used for the evaluation of proposed
   approach. Results show accuracy of 98.33\% with volumetric features and
   100\% with textural features using VFI and LBR. Our approach is
   innovative because of its higher accuracy results as compared to
   existing approaches yet with a smaller feature set.}},

Title = {{Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet
   Transform, PCA, and Feed-Forward Neural Network}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING}},
Year = {{2017}},
Abstract = {{Background. Error-free diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from
   healthy control (HC) patients at an early stage of the disease is a
   major concern, because information about the condition's severity and
   developmental risks present allows AD sufferer to take precautionary
   measures before irreversible brain damage occurs. Recently, there has
   been great interest in computer-aided diagnosis in magnetic resonance
   image (MRI) classification. However, distinguishing between Alzheimer's
   brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 60) is
   challenging because of their highly similar brain patterns and image
   intensities. Recently, cutting-edge feature extraction technologies have
   found extensive application in numerous fields, including medical image
   analysis. Here, we propose a dual-tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT)
   for extracting features from an image. The dimensionality of feature
   vector is reduced by using principal component analysis (PCA). The
   reduced feature vector is sent to feed-forward neural network (FNN) to
   distinguish AD and HC from the input MR images. These proposed and
   implemented pipelines, which demonstrate improvements in classification
   output when compared to that of recent studies, resulted in high and
   reproducible accuracy rates of 90.06 +/- 0.01\% with a sensitivity of
   92.00 +/- 0.04\%, a specificity of 87.78 +/- 0.04\%, and a precision of

Journal = {{APHASIOLOGY}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{31}},
Number = {{9}},
Pages = {{1059-1077}},
Abstract = {{Background: Structural imaging has not been used previously to predict
   the effect of treatment in primary progressive aphasia (PPA).Aims: This
   study examined relationships between baseline brain volume and the
   effects of phonological and orthographic treatments for anomia in PPA.
   It was predicted that lower baseline volume would be associated with
   lower post-treatment naming accuracy for treated items and smaller
   generalisation effects.Methods \& Procedures: Twenty-one individuals
   with PPA participated. The treatment stimuli consisted of nouns that
   were consistently named correctly at baseline (Prophylaxis items) and/or
   nouns that were consistently named incorrectly at baseline (Remediation
   items). All 21 participants had Prophylaxis items, while 10 participants
   had Remediation items. Naming accuracy for Untrained and Trained items
   (Exemplar set 1) was measured. In addition, stimulus generalisation was
   examined by having participants name an alternative exemplar of each
   Untrained and Trained item (Exemplar set 2). Correlational analyses
   focused on the relationships between naming accuracy and volume of
   regions previously identified as having a role in naming and semantic
   processing.Outcomes \& Results: Unexpectedly, there were no significant
   correlations between baseline volume and post-treatment accuracy for
   treated items. However, baseline volume within the left temporal pole
   was positively correlated with post-treatment accuracy for Untrained
   Exemplar set 2 Prophylaxis items, while baseline volume in the left
   inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) was positively correlated with
   post-treatment accuracy for Untrained Exemplar set 1 Remediation
   items.Conclusions: These findings suggest that lower volume in the left
   temporal pole is associated with decline for Untrained items, while
   lower volume in the left ITG is associated with a lack of improvement
   for Untrained items. Possible explanations for the different patterns
   observed across exemplar sets are discussed.}},

Abstract = {{In the last decade, pattern recognition methods using neuroimaging data
   for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been the subject of
   extensive research. Deep learning has recently been a great interest in
   AD classification. Previous works had done almost on single modality
   dataset, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission
   Tomography (PET), shown high performances. However, identifying the
   distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in
   older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain
   patterns and image intensities. The corporation of multimodalities can
   solve this issue since it discovers and uses the further complementary
   of hidden biomarkers from other modalities instead of only one, which
   itself cannot provide. We therefore propose a deep learning method on
   fusion multimodalities. In details, our approach includes Sparse
   Autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) train and test on
   combined PET-MRI data to diagnose the disease status of a patient. We
   focus on advantages of multimodalities to help providing complementary
   information than only one, lead to improve classification accuracy. We
   conducted experiments in a dataset of 1272 scans from ADNI study, the
   proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 90\% between AD
   patients and healthy controls, demonstrate the improvement than using
   only one modality.}},

   brain MRI in Alzheimer's disease}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{13}},
Pages = {{415-427}},
Abstract = {{Rey's Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT) is a powerful
   neuropsychological tool for testing episodic memory, which is widely
   used for the cognitive assessment in dementia and pre-dementia
   conditions. Several studies have shown that an impairment in RAVLT
   scores reflect well the underlying pathology caused by Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), thus making RAVLT an effective early marker to detect AD
   in persons with memory complaints. We investigated the association
   between RAVLT scores (RAVLT Immediate and RAVLT Percent Forgetting) and
   the structural brain atrophy caused by AD. The aim was to
   comprehensively study to what extent the RAVLT scores are predictable
   based on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data using machine
   learning approaches as well as to find the most important brain regions
   for the estimation of RAVLT scores. For this, we built a predictive
   model to estimate RAVLT scores from gray matter density via elastic net
   penalized linear regression model. The proposed approach provided highly
   significant cross-validated correlation between the estimated and
   observed RAVLT Immediate (R = 0.50) and RAVLT Percent Forgetting (R =
   0.43) in a dataset consisting of 806 AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI)
   or healthy subjects. In addition, the selected machine learning method
   provided more accurate estimates of RAVLT scores than the relevance
   vector regression used earlier for the estimation of RAVLT based on MRI
   data. The top predictors were medial temporal lobe structures and
   amygdala for the estimation of RAVLT Immediate and angular gyrus,
   hippocampus and amygdala for the estimation of RAVLT Percent Forgetting.
   Further, the conversion of MCI subjects to AD in 3-years could be
   predicted based on either observed or estimated RAVLT scores with an
   accuracy comparable to MRI-based biomarkers. (C) 2016 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Objective: Nowadays, it is of great interest to identify neuroimaging
   biomarkers for the early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD). It is
   considered that approximately half of patients with a diagnosis of mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) eventually develop Alzheimer's disease, and
   the other half remain stable. In this context, a novel convolutional
   neural network (CNN) based on voxel-based morphometric analysis is
   proposed to predict the prognosis of patients with MCI using their
   baseline structural magnetic resonance (MR) images.
   Methods: Two groups of patients were identified among 305 patients with
   a diagnosis of MCI, those who developed Alzheimer's disease during their
   follow-up (n=140), and those who remained stable in the MCI state
   (n=165). The baseline structural MR images of the patients were used for
   training and evaluating the proposed prediction model. Voxel-based
   morphometry generated from the baseline structural MR images was used to
   obtain significant volume of interests (VOIs) related with gray matter
   damage. Then, a convolutional neural network was trained to extract
   prognostic features from MR images using a set of convolutional feature
   detectors acquired by the training of a patch-based autoencoder.
   Results: This work achieved an accuracy of 78.7\%, slightly superior
   (more than 4\%) to a reference study, for predicting the risk of
   developing Alzheimer's disease for patients with MCI.
   Conclusion: The results of this study show that the use of a
   convolutional neural network using significant topographic regions of
   the brain is successful in predicting the risk of developing Alzheimer's
   disease for patients with MCI.}},

   filter activations throughout brain regions reveals different anatomical
   patterns for different patient class, and thus, allowing us to identify
   the CNN filters with greatest discriminating power and which brain
   regions contribute most. Specifically, the CNN shows the largest
   differentiation between patients in the frontal pole region, which is
   known to host intellectual deficits related to the disease. This shows
   how CNNs could be used to provide interpretability on Alzheimer's and

   SRP-related brain activity in patients diagnosed with mild cognitive
   impairment or early Alzheimer's disease (MCI/AD). Fifteen patients with
   confirmed amyloid-beta deposits (positive florbetapir-PET scan) and 28
   healthy controls (negative florbetapir-PET scan) were included.
   Participants either had to judge personality trait adjectives with
   reference to themselves (self condition) or to a celebrity (other
   condition), or determine whether these adjectives were positive or not
   (semantic condition). These adjectives were then presented with
   distractors in a surprise recognition task. Functional MRI data were
   acquired during both the judgment and recognition tasks. The SRE was
   observed in controls, but reduced in patients. Both controls and
   patients activated cortical midline structures when judging items with
   reference to themselves, but patients exhibited reduced activity in the
   angular gyrus. In patients, activity at encoding in the angular gyrus
   positively correlated with subsequent recognition accuracy in the self
   condition (self accuracy). This region also exhibited significant
   hypometabolism and A beta burden, both related to self accuracy. By
   contrast, there were no differences in brain activity during
   recognition, either between the self and semantic conditions, or between
   groups. These results highlight SRE impairment in patients with MCI/AD,
   despite intact activity in cortical midline structures, and suggest that
   dysfunction of the angular gyrus is related to this impairment.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: It is well known that the carotenoids lutein (L) and
   zeaxanthin (Z) improve eye health and an accumulating evidence base
   suggests cognitive benefits as well. The present study investigated
   underlying neural mechanisms using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). It was hypothesized that lower L and Z concentrations would be
   associated with neurobiological inefficiency ( i.e.,increased
   activation) during cognitive performance. Methods: Forty-three
   community-dwelling older adults (mean age = 72 years; 58\% female; 100\%
   Caucasian) were asked to learn and recall pairs of unrelated words in an
   fMRI-adapted paradigm. L and Z levels were measured in retina (macular
   pigment optical density) and serum using validated procedures. Results:
   Following first-level contrasts of encoding and retrieval trials minus
   control trials (p< .05, family-wise error corrected, minimum voxel
   cluster = 8), L and Z were found to significantly and negatively relate
   to blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal in central and parietal operculum
   cortex, inferior frontal gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, planum polare,
   frontal and middle temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, postcentral

   represents the first attempt to investigate neural mechanisms underlying
   the relation of L and Z to cognition using fMRI. The observed results
   suggest that L and Z promote cognitive functioning in old age by
   enhancing neural efficiency.}},

Title = {{Hyperfamiliarity in Amnestic and Vascular Mild Cognitive Impairment}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Hyperfamiliarity is a phenomenon where new stimuli are
   perceived as familiar. Previous studies have demonstrated familiarity
   disorder in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but mostly from the
   perspective of a neuropsychological approach, and the exact correlation
   of MCI aetiologies with the phenomenon remains uncertain. Based on
   current evidence suggesting a frontal-subcortical pathway contributing
   to familiarity processing, we hypothesize that individuals with a
   vascular aetiology of MCI will likely suffer more familiarity deficits.
   This study aims to examine the real-life hyperfamiliarity symptoms in
   amnestic versus vascular MCI. Methods: Informants of 11 amnestic and 9
   vascular cognitive impairment patients were interviewed about the
   frequency of hyperfamiliarity symptoms in the previous month. MRI brain
   images of vascular cognitive impairment patients were analysed as well.
   Results: Patients with vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia
   (VCIND) showed a significantly higher frequency of hyperfamiliarity for
   people but not places or objects. Within VCIND patients, overall basal
   ganglia hyperintensities, particularly in the putamen, were found to
   significantly correlate to hyperfamiliarity. Conclusions: Patients with
   VCIND suffer more real-life hyperfamiliarity during people recognition
   compared to patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI),
   despite a comparative global decline in cognitive. This is likely due to
   impaired memory retrieval and matching processes resulting from
   subcortical ischaemic lesions.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia (VaD) and frontotemporal
   dementia (FTD) are the most common forms of dementia. It is well known
   that memory deficits in AD are different from those in VaD and FTD,

   was to compare the memory performance in 15 AD, 10 VaD and 9 FTD
   patients and 20 normal controls by means of a 24-item Grober-Buschke
   test {[}8]. The patients' groups were comparable in terms of severity of
   dementia. We considered free and total recall (free plus cued) both in
   immediate and delayed recall and computed an Index of Sensitivity to
   Cueing (ISC) {[}8] for immediate and delayed trials. We assessed whether
   cued recall predicted the subsequent free recall across our patients'
   groups. We found that AD patients recalled fewer items from the
   beginning and were less sensitive to cueing supporting the hypothesis
   that memory disorders in AD depend on encoding and storage deficit. In
   immediate recall VaD and FTD showed a similar memory performance and a
   stronger sensitivity to cueing than AD, suggesting that memory disorders
   in these patients are due to a difficulty in spontaneously implementing
   efficient retrieval strategies. However, we found a lower ISC in the
   delayed recall compared to the immediate trials in VaD than FTD due to a
   higher forgetting in VaD.}},

Title = {{Network-Based Substrate of Cognitive Reserve in Alzheimer's Disease}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE}},
Year = {{2017}},
Volume = {{55}},

Pages = {{421-430}},
Abstract = {{Cognitive reserve (CR) is known to modulate the clinical features of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). This concept may be critical for the
   development of non-pharmacological interventions able to slow down
   patients' cognitive decline in the absence of disease-modifying
   treatments. We aimed at identifying the neurobiological substrates of CR
   (i.e., neural reserve) over the transition between normal aging and AD,
   by assessing the underlying brain networks and their topological
   properties. A cohort of 154 participants (n = 68 with AD, n = 61 with
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 healthy subjects)
   underwent resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing.
   Within each group, participants were classified as having high or low
   CR, and functional connectivity measures were compared, within group,
   between high and low CR individuals. Network-based statistics and
   topological network properties derived from graph theory were explored.
   Connectivity differences between high and low CR were evident only for
   aMCI patients, with participants with high CR showing a significant
   increase of connectivity in a network involving mainly fronto-parietal
   nodes. Conversely, they showed significantly decreased connectivity in a
   network involving fronto-temporo-cerebellar nodes. Consistently, changes
   to topological measures were observed in either direction, and were
   associated with measures of global cognitive function. These findings
   support the hypothesis that CR impacts on neurodegenerative process in
   the early phase of AD only. In addition, they fit with the existence of
   a ``neural reserve{''}, characterized by specific neural networks and
   their efficiency. It remains to be demonstrated whether interventions
   later in life can modulate this ``neural reserve{''}.}},

   Cingulate Networks in Alzheimer's Disease}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{DEC 21}},
Abstract = {{The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a critical brain network hub
   particularly sensitive to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and can be subdivided
   into ventral (vPCC) and dorsal (dPCC) regions. The aim of the present
   study was to highlight functional connectivity (FC) disruption, atrophy,
   and hypometabolism within the ventral and dorsal PCC networks in
   patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or AD.
   Forty-three healthy elders (HE) (68.7 +/- 6 years), 34 aMCI (73.4 +/-
   6.8 years) and 24 AD (70.9 +/- 9.1 years) patients underwent
   resting-state functional MRI, anatomical Ti-weighted MRI and FDG-PET
   scans. We compared FC maps obtained from the vPCC and dPCC seeds in HE
   to identify the ventral and dorsal PCC networks. We then compared
   patients and HE on FC, gray matter volume and metabolism within each
   network. In HE, the ventral PCC network involved the hippocampus and
   posterior occipitotemporal and temporoparietal regions, whereas the
   dorsal PCC network included mainly frontal, middle temporal and
   temporoparietal areas. aMCI patients had impaired ventral network FC in
   the bilateral hippocampus, but dorsal network FC was preserved. In AD,
   the ventral network FC disruption had spread to the left parahippocampal
   and angular regions, while the dorsal network FC was also affected in
   the right middle temporal cortex. The ventral network was atrophied in
   the bilateral hippocampus in aMCI patients, and in the vPCC and angular
   regions as well in AD patients. The dorsal network was only atrophied in
   AD patients, in the dPCC, bilateral supramarginal and temporal regions.
   By contrast, hypometabolism was already present in both the vPCC and
   dPCC networks in aMCI patients, and further extended to include the
   whole networks in AD patients. The vPCC and dPCC connectivity networks
   were differentially sensitive to AD. Atrophy and FC disruption were only
   present in the vPCC network in aMCI patients, and extended to the dPCC
   network in AD patients, suggesting that the pathology spreads from the
   vPCC to the dPCC networks. By contrast, hypometabolism seemed to follow
   a different route, as it was present in both networks since the aMCI
   stage, possibly reflecting not only local disruption but also distant
   synaptic dysfunction.}},

Abstract = {{Cortical and subcortical nuclei degenerate in the dementias, but less is
   known about changes in the white matter tracts that connect them. To
   better understand white matter changes in behavioral variant
   frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and early-onset Alzheimer's disease
   (EOAD), we used a novel approach to extract full 3D profiles of fiber
   bundles from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and map white matter
   abnormalities onto detailed models of each pathway. The result is a
   spatially complex picture of tract-by-tract microstructural changes. Our
   atlas of tracts for each disease consists of 21 anatomically clustered
   and recognizable white matter tracts generated from whole-brain
   tractography in 20 patients with bvFTD, 23 with age-matched EOAD, and 33
   healthy elderly controls. To analyze the landscape of white matter
   abnormalities, we used a point-wise tract correspondence method along
   the 3D profiles of the tracts and quantified the pathway disruptions
   using common diffusion metrics - fractional anisotropy, mean, radial,
   and axial diffusivity. We tested the hypothesis that bvFTD and EOAD are
   associated with preferential degeneration in specific neural networks.
   We mapped axonal tract damage that was best detected with mean and
   radial diffusivity metrics, supporting our network hypothesis, highly
   statistically significant and more sensitive than widely studied
   fractional anisotropy reductions. From white matter diffusivity, we
   identified abnormalities in bvFTD in all 21 tracts of interest but
   especially in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus, frontal callosum,
   anterior thalamic radiations, cingulum bundles and left superior
   longitudinal fasciculus. This network of white matter alterations
   extends beyond the most commonly studied tracts, showing greater white
   matter abnormalities in bvFTD versus controls and EOAD patients. In
   EOAD, network alterations involved more posterior white matter - the
   parietal sector of the corpus callosum and parahipoccampal cingulum
   bilaterally. Widespread but distinctive white matter alterations are a
   key feature of the pathophysiology of these two forms of dementia.}},

Abstract = {{Background and objective: This paper presents an automatic
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system based on feature ranking for
   detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) using structural magnetic
   resonance imaging (sMRI) data.
   Methods: The proposed CAD system is composed of four systematic stages.
   First, global and local differences in the gray matter (GM) of AD
   patients compared to the GM of healthy controls (HCs) are analyzed using
   a voxel-based morphometry technique. The aim is to identify significant
   local differences in the volume of GM as volumes of interests (VOIs).
   Second, the voxel intensity values of the VOIs are extracted as raw
   features. Third, the raw features are ranked using a seven-feature
   ranking method, namely, statistical dependency (SD), mutual information
   (MI), information gain (IG), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC),
   t-test score (TS), Fisher's criterion (FC), and the Gini index (GI). The
   features with higher scores are more discriminative. To determine the
   number of top features, the estimated classification error based on
   training set made up of the AD and HC groups is calculated, with the
   vector size that minimized this error selected as the top discriminative
   feature. Fourth, the classification is performed using a support vector
   machine (SVM). In addition, a data fusion approach among feature ranking
   methods is introduced to improve the classification performance.
   Results: The proposed method is evaluated using a data-set from ADNI
   (130 AD and 130 HC) with 10-fold cross-validation. The classification
   accuracy of the proposed automatic system for the diagnosis of AD is up
   to 92.48\% using the sMRI data.
   Conclusions: An automatic CAD system for the classification of AD based
   on feature-ranking method and classification errors is proposed. In this
   regard, seven-feature ranking methods (i. e., SD, MI, IG, PCC, TS, FC,
   and GI) are evaluated. The optimal size of top discriminative features
   is determined by the classification error estimation in the training
   phase. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the
   proposed system is comparative to that of state-of-the-art
   classification models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is closely related to increased incidence
   of cognitive impairment from the acute phase to chronic phase. At
   present, the pathological mechanism leading to cognitive impairment
   after TBI is still not fully understood. We hypothesize that neuron
   loss, diffuse axonal injury, microbleed, and blood-brain barrier (BBB)
   disruption altogether contribute to the development of cognitive
   impairment. Furthermore, the disruption of structural and functional
   neural network related to the cognitive function might bring about the
   final step in the occurrence of cognitive impairment after TBI. In this
   review, we summarize the role of different MRI techniques in the
   assessment of the pathological changes related to cognitive impairment
   after TBI. These MRI techniques include T1-MPRAGE sequence reflecting
   neuron loss, diffusion tensor imaging reflecting diffuse axonal injury,
   diffusion kurtosis imaging reflecting diffuse axonal injury and reactive
   gliosis, susceptibility weighted imaging showing microbleed, arterial
   spin labeling showing blood flow and dynamic contrast enhanced MRI
   showing BBB disruption. In the future, correlational study of multi-MRI

Abstract = {{Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) constitutes an important tool for the
   early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which, in turn, allows the
   application of treatments that can be simpler and more likely to be
   effective. This paper explores the construction of classification
   methods based on deep learning architectures applied on brain regions
   defined by the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM)
   images from each brain area have been split into 3D patches according to
   the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches are used to train
   different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief networks is
   then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting
   scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting
   schemes are implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent
   classification architecture where discriminative features are computed
   in an unsupervised fashion. The resulting method has been evaluated
   using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by cross-validation
   prove that the proposed method is not only valid for differentiate
   between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good
   performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying
   Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the
   classification architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC

Abstract = {{Changes in the functional connectivity (FC) of large-scale brain
   networks are a prominent feature of brain aging, but defining their
   relationship to variability along the continuum of normal and
   pathological cognitive outcomes has proved challenging. Here we took
   advantage of a well-characterized rat model that displays substantial
   individual differences in hippocampal memory during aging,
   uncontaminated by slowly progressive, spontaneous neurodegenerative
   disease. By this approach, we aimed to interrogate the underlying neural
   network substrates that mediate aging as a uniquely permissive condition
   and the primary risk for neurodegeneration. Using resting state (rs)
   blood oxygenation level-dependent fMRI and a restrosplenial/posterior
   cingulate cortex seed, aged rats demonstrated a large-scale network that
   had a spatial distribution similar to the default mode network (DMN) in
   humans, consistent with earlier findings in younger animals.
   Between-group whole brain contrasts revealed that aged subjects with
   documented deficits in memory (aged impaired) displayed widespread
   reductions in cortical FC, prominently including many areas outside the
   DMN, relative to both young adults (Y) and aged rats with preserved
   memory (aged unimpaired, AU). Whereas functional connectivity was
   relatively preserved in AU rats, they exhibited a qualitatively distinct
   network signature, comprising the loss of an anticorrelated network
   observed in Y adults. Together the findings demonstrate that changes in
   rs-FC are specifically coupled to variability in the cognitive outcome
   of aging, and that successful neurocognitive aging is associated with
   adaptive remodeling, not simply the persistence of youthful network
   dynamics.}},

Abstract = {{Automated study of brain sub-anatomic region like Corpus Callosum (CC)
   is challenging due to its complex topology and varying shape. The
   development of reliable Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) systems would

   drug trails to palliate the effect of AD. In this work, an attempt has
   been made to analyse the shape changes of CC using shape based Laplace
   Beltrami (LB) eigen value features and machine learning techniques. CC
   from the normal and AD T1-weighted magnetic resonance images are
   segmented using Reaction Diffusion (RD) level set method and the
   obtained results are validated against the Ground Truth (GT) images. Ten
   LB eigen values are extracted from the segmented CC images. LB eigen
   values are positive sequence of infinite series that describe the
   intrinsic geometry of objects. These values capture the shape
   information of CC by solving the eigen value problem of LB operator on
   the triangular meshes. The significant features are selected based on
   Information Gain (IG) ranking and subjected to classification using
   K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naive Bayes
   (NB). The performance of LB eigen values in the AD diagnosis is
   evaluated using classifiers' accuracy, specificity and sensitivity
   measures.
   Results show that, RD level set is able to segment CC in normal and AD
   images with high percentage of similarity with GT. The extracted LB
   eigen values are found to show high difference in the mean values
   between normal and AD subjects with high statistical significance. The
   LB eigen modes lambda 2, lambda 7 and lambda 8 are identified as
   prominent features by IG based ranking. KNN is able to give maximum
   classification accuracy of 93.37\% compared to linear SVM and NB
   classifiers. This value is observed to be high than the results obtained
   using geometric features. The proposed CAD system focuses solely on the
   geometric variations of CC extracted using LB eigen value spectrum. The
   extraction of eigen modes in the LB spectrum is easy to compute, does
   not involve too many parameters and less time consuming. Thus this CAD
   study seems to be clinically significant in the shape investigation of
   brain structures for AD diagnosis. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Title = {{The role of the ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex in idiom comprehension:
   An rTMS study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{91}},

Abstract = {{Previous research is equivocal with respect to the neural substrates of
   idiom processing. Particularly elusive is the role of the left
   ventro-lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), a region implicated in
   semantic control generally. Although fMRI studies have shown that the
   left VLPFC is active during idiom processing (see Rapp et al. (2012),
   for review), rTMS studies have failed to corroborate a clear role of
   this prefrontal region (e.g., Oliveri et al., 2004).
   We investigated this issue using a semantic meaningfulness judgment task
   that compared idiom comprehension following rTMS-stimulation to the left
   VLPFC relative to a control site (vertex). We also investigated whether
   individual differences in general cognitive capacity among comprehenders
   modulated the effects of rTMS.
   The results indicate that left VLPFC stimulation particularly affected
   the processing of low-familiar idioms, possibly because these items
   involve a maximal semantic conflict between a salient literal and
   less-known figurative meaning. Of note, this pattern only emerged for
   comprehenders with higher cognitive control capacity, possibly because
   they were more likely to activate or maintain multiple semantic
   representations during idiom processing, which required VLPFC integrity.
   Taken together, the results support the importance of the left VLPFC to
   idiom processing. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Cognitive neuroscience of aging studies traditionally target
   participants age 65 and older. However, epidemiological surveys show
   that many women report increased forgetfulness earlier in the aging
   process, as they transition to menopause. In this population-based fMRI
   study, we stepped back by over a decade to characterize the changes in
   memory circuitry that occur in early midlife, as a function of sex and
   women's reproductive stage. Participants (N = 200; age range, 45-55)
   performed a verbal encoding task during fMRI scanning. Reproductive
   histories and serologic evaluations were used to determine menopausal
   status. Results revealed a pronounced impact of reproductive stage on
   task-evoked hippocampal responses, despite minimal difference in
   chronological age. Next, we examined the impact of sex and reproductive
   stage on functional connectivity across task-related brain regions.
   Postmenopausal women showed enhanced bilateral hippocampal connectivity
   relative to premenopausal and perimenopausal women. Across women, lower
   17 beta-estradiol concentrations were related to more pronounced
   alterations in hippocampal connectivity and poorer performance on a
   subsequent memory retrieval task, strongly implicating sex steroids in
   the regulation of this circuitry. Finally, subgroup analyses revealed
   that high-performing postmenopausal women (relative to low and middle
   performers) exhibited a pattern of brain activity akin to premenopausal
   women. Together, these findings underscore the importance of considering
   reproductive stage, not simply chronological age, to identify neuronal
   and cognitive changes that unfold in the middle decades of life. In
   keeping with preclinical studies, these human findings suggest that the
   decline in ovarian estradiol production during menopause plays a
   significant role in shaping memory circuitry.}},

Abstract = {{Medical media analytics receives vast popularity nowadays because of its
   effectiveness in improving the performance of diverse health-care
   applications. In this study, the essential disease severity prediction
   problem in medical media analytics is investigated and a computer-aided
   diagnosis (CAD) strategy based on ranking and learning techniques is
   presented to tackle the disease severity prediction task. To be
   specific, two types of magnetic resonance images (MRI), including
   T1-weighted images as anatomic MRI and arterial spin labeling (ASL)
   images as functional MRI, are incorporated as multi-modality images to
   provide image-based information for dementia disease severity prediction
   in this study. There are two main steps composed of the whole CAD
   strategy. First, the problem of partial volume effects (PVE) mainly
   caused by signal cross-contamination due to pixel heterogeneity and
   limited spatial resolution of ASL is focused. Conventional
   regression-based PVE correction methods are discussed and their inherent
   problems of blurring and brain details loss in correction results, which
   prevents the actual brain atrophy being revealed, are studied. A
   pixel-based PVE correction method, which only counts on single pixel
   information and formulates the PVE correction problem as a constrained
   optimization problem solved via the split-Bregman algorithm, is
   presented to solve the problem. Second, ranking and learning techniques
   are incorporated based on multi-modality images after performing PVE
   correction for dementia disease severity prediction. Technically, a
   conventional discrete position-based ranking evaluation measure is
   approximated and its surrogated continuous form is optimized via
   gradient ascend for ranking functions learning. A large database
   composed of multi-modality images acquired from 320 real patients is
   utilized for experimental evaluation. Extensive experiments and
   comprehensive statistical analysis are carried out to demonstrate the
   superiority of the introduced CAD strategy with comparison to several
   existing ones. Promising results are reported from the statistical
   perspective. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The presence of irregularities in electroencephalographic (EEG) signals

   distinguishing AD and normal EEG signals. Hence, a fuzzy-entropy concept
   defined in a complex multi-resolution wavelet has been proposed to
   obtain the most appropriate threshold. First, the complex coefficients
   are fuzzified using a Gaussian membership function. Afterwards, the
   ability of the proposed fuzzy-entropy threshold has been compared with
   traditional thresholds in complex wavelet domain. Experimental results
   show that the authors' methodology produces a higher signal-to-noise
   ratio and a lower root-mean-square error than traditional approaches.
   Moreover, a neural network scheme is performed along several features to
   classify AD from normal EEG signals obtaining a specificity of 87.5\%.}},

Abstract = {{Compromised retrieval of autobiographical memory (ABM) is well
   established in neurodegenerative disorders. The recounting of
   autobiographical events is inextricably linked to linguistic knowledge,
   yet no study to date has investigated whether tense use during
   autobiographical narration is disrupted in dementia syndromes. This
   study investigated the incidence of correct past tense use during ABM
   narration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n=10) and semantic
   dementia (SD, n=10) in comparison with healthy older Controls (n=10).
   Autobiographical narratives were analysed for episodic content
   (internal/external) and classified according to tense use
   (past/present). Across both patient groups, use of the past tense was
   significantly compromised relative to Controls, with increased levels of
   off-target present tense verbs observed. Voxel-based morphometry
   analyses based on structural MRI revealed differential associations
   between past tense use and regions of grey matter intensity in the
   brain. Bilateral temporal cortices were implicated in the SD group,
   whereas frontal, lateral, and medial temporal regions including the
   right hippocampus emerged in AD. This preliminary study provides the
   first demonstration of the disruption of specific linguistic constructs
   during autobiographical narration in AD and SD. Future studies are
   warranted to clarify at what point in the disease trajectory such
   deficits in tense use emerge, and whether these deficits are a product
   or contributing factor in memory disruption in these syndromes.}},

Abstract = {{Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is altered in Alzheimer's

Volume = {{45}},
Pages = {{197-211}},

Abstract = {{Aging-related episodic memory decline is often attributed to
   insufficient encoding of new information, although the underlying neural
   processes remain elusive. We here tested the hypothesis that impaired
   memory consolidation contributes to aging-related memory decline. To
   this end, we used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   healthy young and older adults and investigated neural network
   connectivity underlying episodic memory consolidation and the effects of
   aging thereon. During postencoding rest, connectivity increased in
   subregions of temporobasal and temporo-occipital networks but decreased
   in a precuneal network. These connectivity changes predicted subsequent
   memory performance thereby constituting functional correlates of early
   memory consolidation. Furthermore, these consolidation-related regional
   connectivity changes partially overlapped with encoding-related neural
   activity changes, suggesting a close relationship between encoding-and
   consolidation-related activity. Older when compared to young
   participants failed to increase connectivity in the right lingual gyrus
   as part of an extended default mode network during consolidation,
   thereby providing a functional correlate for spatial contextual memory
   deficits. In conclusion, results are consistent with previous reports of
   persistent activity in regions mediating memory encoding as a core
   mechanism underlying episodic memory consolidation. Our data extend
   previous findings suggesting that aging-related memory decline results
   from a reduction of consolidation processes. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Synaptic dysfunction, a key pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's

   medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in predicting conversion from

   individuals that, within a 2-year follow-up period, developed dementia

   encoding-induced abnormal alpha desynchronized activity over the

Abstract = {{Aim: To develop an automatic magnetic resonance (MR) brain

   Method: This article investigated the binary particle swarm optimization

   and time-varying acceleration coefficients (BPSO-MT), BPSO with mutation
   (BPSO-M), and BPSO with time-varying acceleration coefficients (BPSO-T).
   We first extracted wavelet entropy (WE) features from both approximation
   and detail sub-bands of eight-level decomposition. Afterwards, we used
   the proposed BPSO-M, BPSO-T, and BPSO-MT to select features. Finally,
   the selected features were fed into a probabilistic neural network

   Results: The proposed BPSO-MT performed better than BPSO-T and BPSO-M.
   It finally selected two features of entropies of the following two
   sub-bands (V1, D1). The proposed system ``WE + BPSO-MT + PNN{''} yielded
   perfect classification on Data160 and Data66. In addition, it yielded
   99.53\% average accuracy for the Data255, over 10 repetitions of k-fold

Title = {{Exploring anterograde memory: a volumetric MRI study in patients with
   mild cognitive impairment}},
Journal = {{ALZHEIMERS RESEARCH \& THERAPY}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{JUL 30}},
Abstract = {{Background: The aim of this volumetric study was to explore the
   neuroanatomical correlates of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test
   (FCSRT) and the Delayed Matching-to-Sample-48 items (DMS-48), two tests
   widely used in France to assess verbal and visual anterograde memory. We
   wanted to determine to what extent the two tests rely on the medial
   temporal lobe, and could therefore be predictive of Alzheimer's disease,
   in which pathological changes typically start in this region.
   Methods: We analysed data from a cohort of 138 patients with mild
   cognitive impairment participating in a longitudinal multicentre
   clinical research study. Verbal memory was assessed using the FCSRT and
   visual recognition memory was evaluated using the DMS-48. Performances
   on these two tests were correlated to local grey matter atrophy via
   structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry.
   Results: Our results confirm the existence of a positive correlation
   between the volume of the medial temporal lobe and the performance on
   the FCSRT, prominently on the left, and the performance on the DMS-48,
   on the right, for the whole group of patients (family-wise error, P <
   0.05). Interestingly, this region remained implicated only in the
   subgroup of patients who had deficient scores on the cued recall of the
   FCSRT, whereas the free recall was associated with prefrontal aspects.
   For the DMS-48, it was only implicated for the group of patients whose
   performances declined between the immediate and delayed trial.
   Conversely, temporo-parietal cortices were implicated when no decline
   was observed. Within the medial temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus
   was prominently involved for the FCSRT and the immediate trial of the
   DMS-48, whereas the hippocampus was solely involved for the delayed
   trial of the DMS-48.
   Conclusions: The two tests are able to detect an amnestic profile of the
   medial temporal type, under the condition that the scores remain
   deficient after the cued recall of the FCSRT or decline on the delayed
   recognition trial of the DMS-48. Strategic retrieval as well as
   perceptual/attentional processes, supported by prefrontal and
   temporo-parietal cortices, were also found to have an impact on the
   performances. Finally, the implication of the hippocampus appears time
   dependent, triggered by a longer delay than the parahippocampus, rather
   than determined by the sense of recollection or the encoding strength
   associated with the memory trace.}},

Abstract = {{Social-cognitive processing has been posited to underlie general
   functions such as episodic memory. Episodic memory impairment is a
   recognized hallmark of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) who is
   at a high risk for dementia. Three canonical networks, self-referential
   processing, executive control processing and salience processing, have
   distinct roles in episodic memory retrieval processing. It remains
   unclear whether and how these sub-networks of the episodic memory
   retrieval system would be affected in aMCI. This task -state fMRI study
   constructed systems-level episodic memory retrieval sub-networks in 28
   aMCI and 23 controls using two computational approaches: a multiple
   region-of-interest based approach and a voxel-level functional
   connectivity-based approach, respectively. These approaches produced the
   remarkably similar findings that the self-referential processing network
   made critical contributions to episodic memory retrieval in aMCI. More
   conspicuous alterations in self-referential processing of the episodic
   memory retrieval network were identified in aMCI. In order to complete a
   given episodic memory retrieval task, increases in cooperation between
   the self-referential processing network and other sub-networks were
   mobilized in aMCI. Self-referential processing mediate the cooperation
   of the episodic memory retrieval sub-networks as it may help to achieve
   neural plasticity and may contribute to the prevention and treatment of
   dementia. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Differentially worse performance on category versus letter
   fluency suggests greater semantic versus retrieval difficulties. This
   discrepancy, combined with reduced episodic memory, has widespread
   clinical utility in diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our objective
   was to investigate whether changes in semantic processing, as measured
   by the discrepancy between category and letter fluency, was detectable
   in preclinical AD: in clinically normal older adults with abnormal
   beta-amyloid (A beta) deposition on positron emission tomography (PET)
   neuroimaging. Method: Clinically normal older adults (mean Mini Mental
   State Exam (MMSE) score = 29) were classified as A beta+ (n = 70) or A
   beta- (n = 205) using Pittsburgh Compound B-(PET) imaging. Participants
   completed letter fluency (FAS; word generation to letters F-A-S) and
   category fluency (CAT; word generation to animals, vegetables, fruits)
   annually (mean follow-up = 2.42 years). The effect of A beta status on
   fluency over time was examined using linear mixed models controlling for
   age, sex, and education. To dissociate effects related to semantic (CAT)
   versus retrieval processes (CAT and FAS), we repeated models predicting
   CAT over time, controlling for FAS and likewise for CAT controlling for
   FAS. Results: At baseline, the A beta+ group performed better on FAS
   compared with the A beta- group but comparably on CAT. Longitudinally,
   the A beta+ group demonstrated greater decline on CAT compared with the
   A beta- group (p = .0011). This finding remained significant even when
   covarying for FAS (p = .0107). A beta+ participants similarly declined
   compared with A beta- participants on FAS (p = .0112), but this effect
   became insignificant when covarying for CAT (p = .1607). Conclusion:
   These findings provide biomarker validation for the greater specificity
   of declines in category versus letter fluency to underlying AD
   pathology. Our results also suggest that changes in semantic processing
   occur earlier in the AD trajectory than previously hypothesized.}},

Abstract = {{Theory of Mind (ToM) is the ability to understand the perspectives,
   mental states and beliefs of others in order to anticipate their
   behaviour and is therefore crucial to social interactions. Although fMRI
   has been widely used to establish the neural networks implicated in ToM,
   little is known about the timing of ToM-related brain activity. We used
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) to measure the neural processes underlying
   ToM, as MEG provides very accurate timing and excellent spatial
   localization of brain processes. We recorded MEG activity during a false
   belief task, a reliable measure of ToM, in twenty young adults (10
   females). MEG data were recorded in a 151 sensor CTF system (MISL,
   Coquitlam, BC) and data were co-registered to each participant's MRI
   (Siemens 3T) for source reconstruction. We found stronger right
   temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) activations in the false belief
   condition from 150 ms to 225 ms, in the right precuneus from 275 ms to
   375 ms, in the right inferior frontal gyrus from 200 ms to 300 ms and
   the superior frontal gyrus from 300 ms to 400 ms. Our findings extend
   the literature by demonstrating the timing and duration of neural
   activity in the main regions involved in the ``mentalizing{''} network,
   showing that activations related to false belief in adults are
   predominantly right lateralized and onset around 100 ms. The sensitivity
   of MEG will allow us to determine spatial and temporal differences in
   the brain processes in ToM in younger populations or those who
   demonstrate deficits in this ability. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Disease severity prediction is essential in clinical diagnosis nowadays,
   as correct understandings of the onset and progression of disease are
   priceless in treatment planning. In this study, dementia disease, one of
   the most severe non-communicable diseases worldwide, is focused. A novel
   dementia disease severity prediction scheme is proposed using new big
   ranking and learning techniques. To be specific, arterial spin labeling,
   an emerging functional-magnetic resonance imaging technique, is adopted
   to provide image-based clinical data. There are two steps composed of
   the whole scheme. First, a single-pixel based method is presented to
   correct the partial volume effect in arterial spin labeling images. The
   advantage of this method is that, problems of blurring and brain detail
   loss can be well tackled. Second, novel big pair-wise ranking and
   learning techniques is proposed to realize the dementia disease severity
   prediction task using arterial spin labeling images after partial volume
   effects correction. Extensive experiments using a big database composed
   of images acquired from 350 real demented patients are carried out with
   several conventional methods being compared. Comprehensive statistical

Abstract = {{Identifying abnormalities from neuroimaging of brain matters has been a
   crucial way of diagnosis of two closely associated diseases, namely
   Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). Different
   types of neuroimaging have been developed to help such diagnosis, and
   significant research efforts are put into the automation and
   quantification of such diagnosis by computer algorithms over the past
   decades. In this paper we propose an ensemble learning framework to
   create effective models for AD/MCI related classification tasks from
   multiple modalities of neuroimaging and multiple baseline estimators.
   The framework is based on artificial neural networks and it resembles a
   composite model that solves the feature fusion learning problem as well
   as the prediction problem simultaneously, which targets at exploiting
   the prediction power of both fusing multiple data modalities and
   leveraging multiple mutually complementary classification models. We
   conduct extensive experiments on the well-known ADNI dataset and find

Abstract = {{OBJECTIVES: To examine the cognitive and neural effects of vision-based
   speed-of-processing (VSOP) training in older adults with amnestic mild

   DESIGN: Randomized single-blind controlled pilot trial.
   SETTING: Academic medical center.
   PARTICIPANTS: individuals with aMCI (N=21).
   INTERVENTION: Six-week computerized VSOP training.
   MEASUREMENTS: Multiple cognitive processing measures, instrumental
   activities of daily living (TADLs), and two resting state neural
   networks regulating cognitive processing: central executive network
   (CEN) and default mode network (DMN).
   RESULTS: VSOP training led to significantly greater improvements in
   trained (processing speed and attention: 14(1,19)=6.61, partial
   eta(2)=0.26, P=.02) and untrained (working memory: F-1,F-19=7.33,

   CONCLUSION: Target and transfer effects of VSOP training were

Abstract = {{We sought to characterize electrophysiological, eye-tracking and

   four times (4R) and 20 were shown once (1R). Recognition memory was
   assessed by asking participants to make old/new judgments for 80 FN
   pairs, of which half were previously studied items and half were novel
   FN pairs (N). Simultaneous EEG and ET recording were collected during
   recognition trials. Comparisons of event-related potentials (ERPs) for
   correctly identified FN pairs were compared across the three item types
   revealing classic ERP old/new effects including 1) relative positivity
   (1R > N) bi-frontally from 300 to 500 ms, reflecting enhanced
   familiarity, 2) relative positivity (4R > 1R and 4R > N) in parietal

   significant differences in eye movements across conditions. Exploration
   of cross-modality relationships suggested associations between memory
   and executive function measures and the three ERP effects. Executive
   function measures were associated with several indicators of saccadic
   eye movements and fixations, which were also associated with all three
   ERP effects. This novel characterization of face-name recognition memory

   Self-report data were collected including sleep quality assessment via

   the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index was used to signify the presence of
   significant sleep disturbance, as per commonly used methodology. Using
   this criterion, 53\% (n = 30) of our MCI group were classified as

   demonstrated no significant differences, sleep-disturbed MCIs
   demonstrated increased connectivity between temporal and parietal

   Relative to those MCIs without sleep disturbance, sleep-disturbed MCI
   participants demonstrated significantly diminished DMN connectivity

Abstract = {{Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) occurs as a result of mild and

   encephalopathy (CTE), which is a degenerative disease that occurs in
   patients with histories of multiple concussions or head injuries. Boxers
   have been the most commonly studied patient group because they may
   experience thousands of subconcussive hits over the course of a career.
   This study examined the consequences of rTBI with structural brain
   imaging and biomolecular imaging and investigated whether the
   neuropsychological features of rTBI were related to the findings of the
   imaging studies. Five retired professional boxers (mean age, 46.8 +/-

   years) were studied. Cognitive-motor related functional impairment was
   assessed, and all subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation and
   behavioral tasks, as well as structural brain imaging and
   functional-molecular imaging. In neuropsychological tests, boxers showed
   deficits in delayed retrieval of visuospatial memory and motor
   coordination, which had a meaningful relationship with biomolecular
   imaging results indicative of neuronal injury. Morphometric
   abnormalities were not found in professional boxers by structural
   magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Glucose metabolism was impaired in
   frontal areas associated with cognitive dysfunction, similar to findings
   in Alzheimer's disease. Low binding potential (BP) of F-18-flumazenil
   (FMZ) was found in the angular gyrus and temporal cortical regions,

Abstract = {{BackgroundMemory impairment is considered a hallmark of amnestic mild

   compared with age-matched healthy older adults, using multi-channel
   near-infrared spectroscopy.
   MethodsWe examined 64 older adults with aMCI (mean 71.8years) and 66
   cognitively healthy control subjects comparable in age and gender (mean
   71.7years). The concentration of oxy-hemoglobin, which is a reliable
   biomarker of changes in regional cerebral blood flow, was measured in
   the prefrontal cortex during encoding and delayed retrieval of a list of
   10 target words. Task performance was evaluated as average number of
   correct answers in the retrieval task.
   ResultsSubjects with aMCI showed reduced activation in the bilateral
   dorsolateral cortex (approximately Brodmann area 9) and provided fewer
   correct answers in the retrieval period than control subjects. There
   were no significant differences during encoding.
   ConclusionsReduced activation in the dorsolateral cortex during
   retrieval may cause deficits in memory performance, which may be used as
   a marker of aMCI. Further studies are required to examine the predictive
   validity of this decreased activation pattern for the incidence of

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a cognitive disorder characterized by

   decompose the MEG signal into a set of adaptive sub bands according to
   its contained frequency information. In step 2, a nonlinear dynamics
   measure based on permutation entropy (PE) analysis is employed to

   In step 3, an analysis of variation (ANOVA) is used for feature
   selection. In step 4, the enhanced probabilistic neural network (EPNN)

   proposed methodology are validated using the sensed MEG data obtained
   experimentally from 18 MCI and 19 control patients. (c) 2016 Elsevier

Title = {{tACS Phase Locking of Frontal Midline Theta Oscillations Disrupts
   Working Memory Performance}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{MAY 6}},
Abstract = {{Background: Frontal midline theta (FMT) oscillations (4-8 Hz) are
   strongly related to cognitive and executive control during mental tasks
   such as memory processing, arithmetic problem solving or sustained
   attention. While maintenance of temporal order information during a
   working memory (WM) task was recently linked to FMT phase, a positive
   correlation between FMT power, WM demand and WM performance was shown.
   However, the relationship between these measures is not well understood,
   and it is unknown whether purposeful FMT phase manipulation during a WM
   task impacts FMT power and WM performance. Here we present evidence that
   FMT phase manipulation mediated by transcranial alternating current
   stimulation (tACS) can block WM demand-related FMT power increase (FMT
   Delta power) and disrupt normal WM performance.
   Methods: Twenty healthy volunteers were assigned to one of two groups
   (group A, group B) and performed a 2-back task across a baseline block
   (block 1) and an intervention block (block 2) while 275-sensor
   magnetoencephalography (MEG) was recorded. After no stimulation was
   applied during block 1, participants in group A received tACS
   oscillating at their individual FMT frequency over the prefrontal cortex
   (PFC) while group B received sham stimulation during block 2. After
   assessing and mapping phase locking values (PLV) between the tACS signal
   and brain oscillatory activity across the whole brain, FMT power and WM
   performance were assessed and compared between blocks and groups.
   Results: During block 2 of group A but not B, FMT oscillations showed
   increased PLV across task-related cortical areas underneath the frontal
   tACS electrode. While WM task-related FMT Delta power and WM performance
   were comparable across groups in block 1, tACS resulted in lower FMT
   Delta power and WM performance compared to sham stimulation in block 2.
   Conclusion: tACS-related manipulation of FMT phase can disrupt WM
   performance and influence WM task-related FMT Delta power. This finding
   may have important implications for the treatment of brain disorders
   such as depression and attention deficit disorder associated with
   abnormal regulation of FMT activity or disorders characterized by
   dysfunctional coupling of brain activity, e.g., epilepsy, Alzheimer's or
   Parkinson's disease (AD/PD).}},

Abstract = {{BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Human entorhinal cortex (ERC) connects the
   temporal neocortex with hippocampus and is essential for memory
   retrieval and navigation. Markedly, there have been only few
   quantitative MRI works on the ERC geometric measurements in pediatric
   and adult healthy subjects across the lifespan. Here, we sought to fill
   this gap in knowledge by quantifying the ERC thickness in a very large
   cohort of subjects spanning 9 decades of life.
   METHODS: Using magnetic resonance imaging data from multiple centers
   (IXI, MMRR, NKI, OASIS combined with the NIH-Child Dev database and
   locally recruited healthy subjects), we analyzed the lifespan trajectory
   of ERC thickness in 1,660 healthy controls ranging from 2 to 94 years of
   age.
   RESULTS: The ERC thickness increased with age, reached a peak at about
   44 years, and then decreased with age. ERC thickness is hemispherically
   rightward-asymmetric with no gender differences. Mean ERC thickness was
   found to vary between 2.943 +/- .438 mm and 3.525 +/- .355 mm across
   different age populations. Also, more pronounced loss of the ERC
   thickness in healthy aging men was noticeable.
   DISCUSSION: Our report with high spatial resolution brain MRI data from
   1,660 healthy controls provided important clues about ERC thickness
   across lifespan. We believe that our report will pave the way for the
   future studies investigating distinct neural pathologies related with
   cognitive dysfunctions.}},

   resonance imaging technique, is adopted in a newly proposed image-based
   immersive tool for dementia disease diagnosis. Novel pairwise ranking
   and learning techniques based on a new continuous and differentiable

Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{Epileptic seizure detection plays an important role in the diagnosis of
   epilepsy and reducing the massive workload of reviewing
   electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. In this work, a novel algorithm
   is developed to detect seizures employing log-Euclidean Gaussian
   kernel-based sparse representation (SR) in long-term EEG recordings.
   Unlike the traditional SR for vector data in Euclidean space, the
   log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel-based SR framework is proposed for seizure
   detection in the space of the symmetric positive definite (SPD)
   matrices, which form a Riemannian manifold. Since the Riemannian
   manifold is nonlinear, the log-Euclidean Gaussian kernel function is
   applied to embed it into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) for
   performing SR. The EEG signals of all channels are divided into epochs
   and the SPD matrices representing EEG epochs are generated by covariance
   descriptors. Then, the testing samples are sparsely coded over the
   dictionary composed by training samples utilizing log-Euclidean Gaussian
   kernel-based SR. The classification of testing samples is achieved by
   computing the minimal reconstructed residuals. The proposed method is
   evaluated on the Freiburg EEG dataset of 21 patients and shows its
   notable performance on both epoch-based and event-based assessments.
   Moreover, this method handles multiple channels of EEG recordings
   synchronously which is more speedy and efficient than traditional
   seizure detection methods.}},

Abstract = {{Amyloid beta accumulation into insoluble plaques (A beta p) is known to
   play a significant role in the pathological process in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). The presence of A beta p is also one of the
   neuropathological hallmarks for the disease. AD final diagnosis is
   generally acknowledged after the evaluation of A beta p deposition in
   the brain. Insoluble A beta p accumulation may also concur to cause AD
   as postulated in the so-called amyloid hypothesis. Therefore, the
   visualization, evaluation and quantification of A beta p are nowadays
   the keys for a better understanding of the disease, which may point to a
   possible cure for AD in the near future. Synchrotron-based X-ray phase
   contrast (XPC) has been demonstrated as the only imaging method that can
   retrieve the A beta p signal with high spatial resolution (up to 10 mu
   m), high sensitivity and three-dimensional information at the same time.
   Although at the moment XPC is suitable for ex vivo samples only, it may
   develop into an alternative to positron emission tomography and magnetic
   resonance imaging in A beta p imaging. In this contribution the
   possibility of using synchrotron-based X-ray phase propagation computed
   tomography to visualize and measure A beta p on mouse brains is
   presented. A careful setup optimization for this application leads to a
   significant improvement of spatial resolution (similar to 1 mu m), data
   acquisition speed (five times faster), X-ray dose (five times lower) and
   setup complexity, without a substantial loss in sensitivity when
   compared with the classic implementation of grating-based X-ray

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) is a functional molecular imaging,
   which helps to diagnose neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), by evaluating cerebral metabolic rate of glucose after
   administration of (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-glucose ((18)FDG). A quantitative
   evaluation, using computer aided methods, is of importance to improve
   medical care. In this paper a novel ranking method of the effectiveness
   of brain region of interest to classify healthy and AD brain is
   developed. Brain images are first segmented into 116 regions according
   to an anatomical atlas. A spatial normalization and four gray level
   normalization methods are used for comparison. Each extracted region is
   then characterized by a feature set based on gray level histogram
   moments, as well as age and gender of a subject. Using a receiver
   operating characteristic curve for each region, it was possible to
   define a Separating Power Factor (SPF) to rank region's ability to
   separate healthy from AD brain images. Using a set of selected regions,
   according to their rank, and when inputting them to a support vector
   machine classifier, it was possible to show that classification results
   were similar or slightly better than those obtained when using the whole
   gray matter voxels of the brain or the 116 regions as input features to
   the classifier. Computational time was reduced compared to the other

Title = {{An Evolutionary Computation Approach to Examine Functional Brain
   Plasticity}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2016}},
Volume = {{10}},
Month = {{APR 5}},
Abstract = {{One common research goal in systems neurosciences is to understand how
   the functional relationship between a pair of regions of interest (ROls)
   evolves over time. Examining neural connectivity in this way is
   well-suited for the study of developmental processes, learning, and even
   in recovery or treatment designs in response to injury. For most fMRI
   based studies, the strength of the functional relationship between two
   ROls is defined as the correlation between the average signal
   representing each region. The drawback to this approach is that much
   information is lost due to averaging heterogeneous voxels, and
   therefore, the functional relationship between a ROI-pair that evolve at
   a spatial scale much finer than the ROls remain undetected. To address
   this shortcoming, we introduce a novel evolutionary computation (EC)
   based voxel-level procedure to examine functional plasticity between an
   investigator defined ROI-pair by simultaneously using subject-specific
   BOLD-fMRI data collected from two sessions seperated by finite duration
   of time. This data-driven procedure detects a sub-region composed of
   spatially connected voxels from each ROI (a so-called sub-regional-pair)
   such that the pair shows a significant gain/loss of functional
   relationship strength across the two time points. The procedure is
   recursive and iteratively finds all statistically significant
   sub-regional-pairs within the ROls. Using this approach, we examine
   functional plasticity between the default mode network (DMN) and the
   executive control network (ECN) during recovery from traumatic brain
   injury (TBI); the study includes 14 TBI and 12 healthy control subjects.
   We demonstrate that the EC based procedure is able to detect functional
   plasticity where a traditional averaging based approach fails. The
   subject-specific plasticity estimates obtained using the EC-procedure
   are highly consistent across multiple runs. Group-level analyses using
   these plasticity estimates showed an increase in the strength of
   functional relationship between DMN and ECN for TBI subjects, which is
   consistent with prior findings in the TBI-literature. The EC-approach
   also allowed us to separate sub-regional-pairs contributing to positive
   and negative plasticity; the detected sub-regional-pairs significantly
   overlap across runs thus highlighting the reliability of the
   EC-approach. These sub-regional-pairs may be useful in performing
   nuanced analyses of brain-behavior relationships during recovery from
   TBI.}},

Abstract = {{Verbal fluency (VF) impairments occur early in Alzheimer's disease (AD)

   study evaluated whether VF impairments in early AD and normal aging rely

   patients and 24 healthy elderly. Linear regressions were performed
   between accuracy and time intervals in VF scores and structural

   Phonemic VF showed unique associations between intervals and WM in
   left-hemisphere tracts. The association between GM in hippocampus,
   subcortical structures and semantic accuracy differentiated patients
   from controls. Results showed that VF impairments are primarily
   associated with same structural brain changes in AD as in healthy

Abstract = {{Studies on resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI)
   have shown that different brain regions still actively interact with
   each other while a subject is at rest, and such functional interaction
   is not stationary but changes over time. In terms of a large-scale brain
   network, in this paper, we focus on time-varying patterns of functional
   networks, i.e., functional dynamics, inherent in rs-fMRI, which is one
   of the emerging issues along with the network modelling. Specifically,
   we propose a novel methodological architecture that combines deep
   learning and state-space modelling, and apply it to rs-fMRI based Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (MCI) diagnosis. We first devise a Deep
   Auto-Encoder (DAE) to discover hierarchical non-linear functional
   relations among regions, by which we transform the regional features
   into an embedding space, whose bases are complex functional networks.
   Given the embedded functional features, we then use a Hidden Markov
   Model (HMM) to estimate dynamic characteristics of functional networks
   inherent in rs-fMRI via internal states, which are unobservable but can
   be inferred from observations statistically. By building a generative
   model with an HMM, we estimate the likelihood of the input features of
   rs-fMRI as belonging to the corresponding status, i.e., MCI or normal
   healthy control, based on which we identify the clinical label of a
   testing subject. In order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed
   method, we performed experiments on two different datasets and compared
   with state-of-the-art methods in the literature. We also analyzed the
   functional networks learned by DAE, estimated the functional
   connectivities by decoding hidden states in HMM, and investigated the
   estimated functional connectivities by means of a graph-theoretic

Abstract = {{High-dimensional classification approaches have been widely used to
   investigate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for automatic
   classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper describes the use
   of t-test based feature-ranking approach as part of a novel feature
   selection procedure, where the number of top features is determined
   using the Fisher Criterion. The proposed classification system involves
   five systematic levels. First, voxel-based morphometry technique is used
   to compare the global and local differences of gray matter in patients
   with AD versus healthy controls (HCs). The significant local differences
   in gray matter volume are then selected as volumes of interests (VOls).
   Second, the voxel clusters are employed as VOIs, where each voxel is
   considered to be a feature. Third, all the features are ranked using
   t-test scores. In this regard, the Fisher Criterion between the AD and
   HC groups is calculated for a changing number of ranked features, where
   the vector size maximizing the Fisher Criterion is selected as the
   optimal number of top discriminative features. Fourth, the
   classification is performed using support vector machine. Finally, data
   fusion methods among atrophy clusters are used to improve the
   classification performance. The experimental results indicate that the
   performance of the proposed system could compete well with the

Abstract = {{Mental time travel (MTT) entails the ability to mentally travel into
   autobiographical memory (AM) and episodic future thinking (EFT). While
   AM and EFT share common phenomenological and cerebral functional
   properties, distinctive characteristics have been documented in healthy
   and clinical populations. No report, to our knowledge, has informed on
   the functional underpinnings of MTT impairment in multiple sclerosis
   (MS) patients, hence the aim of this work. We studied 22
   relapsing-remitting MS patients and 22 matched controls. Participants
   underwent an AM/EFT assessment using the Autobiographical Interview
   (Levine et al. 2002), followed by a functional MRI session. The latter
   consisted in AM and EFT tasks, distinguishing the construction and
   elaboration phases of events. The results showed impaired performance
   for AM and EFT in patients, accompanied by increased cerebral
   activations mostly located in the frontal regions, which extended to the
   parietal, lateral temporal and posterior regions during AM/EFT tasks,
   relative to healthy controls. Enhanced brain activations in MS patients
   were particularly evident during the EFT task and involved the
   hippocampus, frontal, external temporal, and cingulate regions. The
   construction phase required greater frontoparieto-temporal activations
   in MS patients relative to both healthy controls, and the elaboration

Abstract = {{IMPORTANCE Abnormal eating behaviors are common in patients with
   frontotemporal dementia (FTD), yet their exact prevalence, severity, and
   underlying biological mechanisms are not understood.
   OBJECTIVE To define the severity of abnormal eating behavior and sucrose
   preference and their neural correlates in patients with behavioral
   variant FTD (bvFTD) and semantic dementia.
   DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Forty-nine patients with dementia (19
   with bvFTD, 15 with semantic dementia, and 15 with Alzheimer disease)
   were recruited, and their eating behavior was compared with that of 25
   healthy controls. The study was conducted from November 1, 2013, through
   May 31, 2015, and data analyzed from June 1 to August 31, 2015.
   MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Patients participated in an ad libitum
   breakfast test meal, and their total caloric intake and food preferences
   were measured. Changes in eating behavior were also measured using the
   Appetite and Eating Habits Questionnaire (APEHQ) and the Cambridge
   Behavioral Inventory (CBI). Sucrose preference was tested by measuring
   liking ratings of 3 desserts of varying sucrose content (A: 26\%, B:
   39\%, C: 60\%). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of whole-brain 3-T
   high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine
   the gray matter density changes across groups and their relations to
   eating behaviors.
   RESULTS Mean (SD) ages of patients in all 4 groups ranged from 62 (8.3)
   to 66 (8.4) years. At the ad libitum breakfast test meal, all patients
   with bvFTD had increased total caloric intake (mean, 1344 calories)
   compared with the Alzheimer disease (mean, 710 calories), semantic
   dementia (mean, 573 calories), and control groups (mean, 603 calories)
   (P <.001). Patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia had a strong
   sucrose preference compared with the other groups. Increased caloric
   intake correlated with atrophy in discrete neural networks that differed
   between patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia but included the
   cingulate cortices, thalami, and cerebellum in patients with bvFTD, with
   the addition of the orbitofrontal cortices and nucleus accumbens in
   patients with semantic dementia. A distributed network of neural
   correlates was associated with sucrose preference in patients with FTD.
   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Marked hyperphagia is restricted to bvFTD,
   present in all patients with this diagnosis, and supports its diagnostic
   value. Differing neural networks control eating behavior in patients
   with bvFTD and semantic dementia and are likely responsible for the
   differences seen, with a similar network controlling sucrose preference.
   These networks share structures that control cognitive-reward,
   autonomic, neuroendocrine, and visual modulation of eating behavior.
   Delineating the neural networks involved in mediating these changes in
   eating behavior may enable treatment of these features in patients with
   complex medical needs and aid in our understanding of structures that
   control eating behavior in patients with FTD and healthy individuals.}},

Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Complexity measures have been enormously used in schizophrenia patients
   to estimate brain dynamics. However, the conflicting results in terms of
   both increased and reduced complexity values have been reported in these
   studies depending on the patients' clinical status or symptom severity
   or medication and age status. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the nonlinear brain dynamics of chronic and medicated
   schizophrenia patients using distinct complexity estimators. EEG data
   were collected from 22 relaxed eyes-closed patients and age-matched
   healthy controls. A single-trial EEG series of 2 min was partitioned
   into identical epochs of 20 s intervals. The EEG complexity of
   participants were investigated and compared using approximate entropy
   (ApEn), Shannon entropy (ShEn), Kolmogorov complexity (KC) and
   Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC). Lower complexity values were obtained in
   schizophrenia patients. The most significant complexity differences
   between patients and controls were obtained in especially left frontal
   (F3) and parietal (P3) regions of the brain when all complexity measures
   were applied individually. Significantly, we found that KC was more
   sensitive for detecting EEG complexity of patients than other estimators
   in all investigated brain regions. Moreover, significant
   inter-hemispheric complexity differences were found in the frontal and
   parietal areas of schizophrenics' brain. Our findings demonstrate that
   the utilizing of sensitive complexity estimators to analyze brain
   dynamics of patients might be a useful discriminative tool for
   diagnostic purposes. Therefore, we expect that nonlinear analysis will
   give us deeper understanding of schizophrenics' brain.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Remembering the past and imaging the future are both
   manifestations of mental time travel'. These processes have been found
   to be impaired in patients with bilateral hippocampal lesions. Here, we
   examined the question of whether future thinking is affected by other
   Papez circuit lesions, namely: damage to the mammillary
   bodies/fornix.Method: Case (SL) was a 43-year-old woman who developed
   dense anterograde and retrograde amnesia suddenly, as a result of
   Wernicke-Korsakoff's syndrome. A region of interest volumetric Magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) analysis was performed. We assessed past and
   future thinking in SL and 11 control subjects of similar age and
   education with the adapted Autobiographical Interview (AI). Participants
   also completed a battery of neuropsychological tests.Results: Volumetric
   MRI analyses revealed severely reduced fornix and mammillary body
   volumes, but intact hippocampi. SL showed substantial, albeit temporally
   graded retrograde memory deficits on the adapted AI. Strikingly, whilst
   SL could not provide any specific details of events from the past two
   weeks or past two years and had impaired recall of events from her late
   30s, her descriptions of potential future events were normal in number
   of event details and plausibility.Conclusions: This dissociation of past
   and future events' performance after mammillary body and fornix damage
   is at odds with the findings of the majority of patients with adult
   onset hippocampal amnesia. It suggests that these non-hippocampal
   regions of the Papez circuit are only critical for past event retrieval
   and not for the generation of possible future events.}},

Abstract = {{Atlas-based automated anatomical labeling is a fundamental tool in
   medical image segmentation, as it defines regions of interest for
   subsequent analysis of structural and functional image data. The
   extensive investigation of multi-atlas warping and fusion techniques
   over the past 5 or more years has clearly demonstrated the advantages of
   consensus-based segmentation. However, the common approach is to use
   multiple atlases with a single registration method and parameter set,
   which is not necessarily optimal for every individual scan, anatomical
   region, and problem/data-type. Different registration criteria and
   parameter sets yield different solutions, each providing complementary
   information. Herein, we present a consensus labeling framework that
   generates a broad ensemble of labeled atlases in target image space via
   the use of several warping algorithms, regularization parameters, and
   atlases. The label fusion integrates two complementary sources of
   information: a local similarity ranking to select locally optimal
   atlases and a boundary modulation term to refine the segmentation
   consistently with the target image's intensity profile. The ensemble
   approach consistently outperforms segmentations using individual warping
   methods alone, achieving high accuracy on several benchmark datasets.
   The MUSE methodology has been used for processing thousands of scans
   from various datasets, producing robust and consistent results. MUSE is
   publicly available both as a downloadable software package, and as an

   Computer-aided diagnosis methods could process and analyze

Abstract = {{Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) is an emerging magnetic resonance imaging
   technique attracting increasing attention in dementia diagnosis only
   beginning from recent years. ASL is capable to provide direct and
   quantitative measurement of cerebral blood flow (CBF) of scanned
   patients, so that brain atrophy of demented patients could be revealed
   by measured low CBF within certain brain regions through ASL. However,
   partial volume effects (PVE) mainly caused by signal cross-contamination
   due to pixel heterogeneity and limited spatial resolution of ASL, often
   prevents CBF from being precisely measured. Inaccurate CBF is prone to
   mislead and even deteriorate dementia disease diagnosis results,
   thereafter. In this paper, a novel dementia disease diagnosis strategy
   based on ASL is proposed for the first time. The diagnosis strategy is
   composed of two steps: 1) to conduct pixel-wise PVE correction on
   original ASL images and 2) to predict dementia disease severities based
   on corrected ASL images via ranking. Extensive experiments and
   comprehensive statistical analysis are carried out to demonstrate the
   superiority of the new strategy with comparison to several existing
   ones. Promising results are reported from the statistical point of view.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: A family history of Alzheimer's disease (AD) increases the
   risk of developing AD and can influence the accumulation of
   well-established AD biomarkers. There is some evidence that family
   history can influence episodic memory performance even in cognitively
   normal individuals. We attempted to replicate the effect of family
   history on episodic memory and used a specific computational model of
   binary decision making (the diffusion model) to understand precisely how
   family history influences cognition. Finally, we assessed the
   sensitivity of model parameters to family history controlling for
   standard neuropsychological test performance. Method: Across 2
   experiments, cognitively healthy participants from the Adult Children
   Study completed an episodic recognition test consisting of high-and
   low-frequency words. The diffusion model was applied to decompose
   accuracy and reaction time (RT) into latent parameters which were
   analyzed as a function of family history. Results: In both experiments,
   individuals with a family history of AD exhibited lower recognition
   accuracy and this occurred in the absence of an apolipoprotein E (APOE)
   epsilon 4 allele. The diffusion model revealed this difference was due
   to changes in the quality of information accumulation (the drift rate)
   and not differences in response caution or other model parameters. This
   difference remained after controlling for several standard
   neuropsychological tests. Conclusions: These results confirm that the
   presence of a family history of AD confers a subtle cognitive deficit in
   episodic memory as reflected by decreased drift rate that cannot be
   attributed to APOE. This measure may serve as a novel cognitive marker
   of preclinical AD.}},

Abstract = {{Adapted from the work of Kahana and colleagues (e.g., Kahana, 1996), we
   present two measures of order of recall in neuropsychological free
   recall tests. These are the position on the study list of the first
   recalled item, and the degree of variability in the order in which items
   are reported at test (i.e., the temporal distance across the first four
   recalled items). We tested two hypotheses in separate experiments: (1)
   whether these measures predicted generalized cognitive ability, and (2)
   whether they predicted gray matter hippocampal volume. To test
   hypothesis 1, we conducted ordinal regression analyses on data from a
   group of 452 participants, aged 60 or above. Memory performance was
   measured with Rey's AVLT and generalized cognitive ability was measured
   with the MMSE test. To test hypothesis 2, we conducted a linear
   regression analysis on data from a sample of 79 cognitively intact
   individuals aged 60 or over. Memory was measured with the BSRT and
   hippocampal volume was extracted from MRI images. Results of Experiment
   1 showed that the position of the first item recalled and the degree of
   output order variability correlated with MMSE scores only in the delayed
   test, but not in the immediate test. In Experiment 2, the degree of
   variability in the recall sequence of the delayed trial correlated
   (negatively) with hippocampal size. These findings confirm the
   importance of delayed primacy as a marker of cognitive ability, and are
   consistent with the idea that the hippocampus is involved in coding the
   temporal context of learned episodes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{The aim of this pilot study was to analyze spontaneous
   electroencephalography (EEG) activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by
   means of Cross-Sample Entropy (Cross-SampEn) and two local measures
   derived from graph theory: clustering coefficient (CC) and
   characteristic path length (PL). Five minutes of EEG activity were
   recorded from 37 patients with dementia due to AD and 29 elderly
   controls. Our results showed that Cross-SampEn values were lower in the
   AD group than in the control one for all the interactions among EEG
   channels. This finding indicates that EEG activity in AD is
   characterized by a lower statistical dissimilarity among channels.
   Significant differences were found mainly for fronto-central
   interactions (p < 0.01, permutation test). Additionally, the application
   of graph theory measures revealed diverse neural network changes, i.e.
   lower CC and higher PL values in AD group, leading to a less efficient
   brain organization. This study suggests the usefulness of our approach
   to provide further insights into the underlying brain dynamics
   associated with AD.}},

Abstract = {{Over the past decade, machine learning techniques and in particular
   predictive modeling and pattern recognition in biomedical sciences, from
   drug delivery systems to medical imaging, have become one of the most
   important methods of assisting researchers in gaining a deeper
   understanding of issues in their entirety and solving complex medical
   problems. Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in
   classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper,
   we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers
   brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this
   type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model
   or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when
   compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease.
   Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as
   Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic
   aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features.
   Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture
   LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers
   subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data
   reached 96.85\%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale
   invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning
   classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing
   clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for
   expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.}},

Abstract = {{It has been proven that the dendritic lattice neural network (DLNN) has
   the advantages of fast calculation, nonexistent convergence problems,
   and a superior capacity to store information. However, several datasets
   have also shown that the DLNN still suffers from low classification
   accuracy problems. This paper proposes that the main reason behind this
   problem is that the original DLNN cannot classify the samples that fall
   outside of all the hyperboxes. In order to solve this problem, a fuzzy
   inclusion measure is introduced to improve DLNN model's testing
   algorithm. The improved testing algorithm of the DLNN model consists of
   two parts: (1) the classification of samples covered by a hyperbox with
   the DLNN model, and (2) the classification of samples outside all of the
   hyperboxes based on the principle of maximum membership degree.
   Throughout this study, four standard datasets were employed to evaluate
   the effectiveness of the improved DLNN (based on comparisons with the
   original DLNN). Experimental results show that, in both the training and
   testing samples, the improved DLNN is capable of higher classification
   accuracies than the original DLNN.}},

Abstract = {{Initial stages of Alzheimer's disease are easily confused with the
   normal aging process. Additionally, the methodology involved in the
   diagnosis by radiologists can be subjective and difficult to document.
   In this scenario, the development of accessible approaches capable of
   supporting the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial.
   Various approaches have been employed with this objective, specially
   using brain MRI scans. Although certain satisfactory accuracy results
   have been achieved, most of the approaches requires very specific
   pre-processing steps based on the brain anatomy.
   In this paper, we present a novel image retrieval approach for
   supporting the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic, based on general use
   features and unsupervised post-processing step. The brain MRI scans are
   processed and retrieved through general features without any
   pre-processing step. In the following, a rank-based unsupervised
   distance learning procedure is performed for improving the effectiveness
   of the initial results. Experimental results demonstrate that the
   proposed approach can achieve effective retrieval results, being
   suitable in aiding the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.}},

Abstract = {{In spite of the worldwide financial and research efforts made, the
   pathophysiological mechanism at the basis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is
   still poorly understood. Previous studies using electroencephalography
   (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled
   with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their
   enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out
   on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the
   possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and
   novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The
   study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be
   useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at
   least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the
   representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks
   (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then
   able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia
   (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls
   (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of
   convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate
   assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of
   EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here
   proposed is able to reach an averaged 80\% of correct classification
   with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a
   Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a
   final block of the procedure.}},

   Especially, deep learning has great superiority in image analysis and

   example to show advantages of deep learning in diagnosing brain diseases
   and providing clinical decision support. Firstly, we convert raw
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent
   activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional
   connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is
   obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain
   regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to
   classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the
   experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction
   achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the
   correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides
   strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine
   (SVM), about 25\% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The

Abstract = {{Early diagnosis, playing an important role in preventing progress and
   treating the Alzheimer's disease (AD), is based on classification of
   features extracted from brain images. The features have to accurately
   capture main AD-related variations of anatomical brain structures, such
   as, e.g., ventricles size, hippocampus shape, cortical thickness, and
   brain volume. This paper proposed to predict the AD with a deep 3D
   convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), which can learn generic features
   capturing AD biomarkers and adapt to different domain datasets. The
   3D-CNN is built upon a 3D convolutional autoencoder, which is
   pre-trained to capture anatomical shape variations in structural brain
   MRI scans. Fully connected upper layers of the 3D-CNN are then
   fine-tuned for each task-specific AD classification. Experiments on the

Abstract = {{MRI brain atlases are widely used for automated image segmentation, and
   in particular, recent developments in multi-atlas techniques have shown
   highly accurate segmentation results. In this study, we extended the
   role of the atlas library from mere anatomical reference to a
   comprehensive knowledge database with various patient attributes, such
   as demographic, functional, and diagnostic information. In addition to
   using the selected (heavily- weighted) atlases to achieve high
   segmentation accuracy, we tested whether the non-anatomical attributes
   of the selected atlases could be used to estimate patient attributes.
   This can be considered a context-based image retrieval (CBIR) approach,
   embedded in the multi-atlas framework. We first developed an image
   similarity measurement to weigh the atlases on a structure-by-structure
   basis, and then, the attributes of the multiple atlases were weighted to
   estimate the patient attributes. We tested this concept first by
   estimating age in a normal population; we then performed functional and
   diagnostic estimations in Alzheimer's disease patients. The accuracy of
   the estimated patient attributes was measured against the actual
   clinical data, and the performance was compared to conventional
   volumetric analysis. The proposed CBIR framework by multi-atlas voting
   would be the first step toward a knowledge-based support system for
   quantitative radiological image reading and diagnosis. (C) 2016 The

Abstract = {{The assessment of in vivo F-18 images targeting amyloid deposition is
   currently carried on by visual rating with an optional quantification

   involves a minimal image preprocessing and does not rely on small,
   specific regions of interest (ROIs). It evaluates the whole brain and
   delivers a geometrical/intensity score to be used for ranking and
   dichotomic assessment. The method was applied to 504 F-18-florbetapir
   images from the ADNI database. Five expert readers provided visual
   assessment in blind and open sessions. The longitudinal trend and the
   comparison to SUVr measurements were also evaluated. ELBA performed with
   area under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.997 versus the visual assessment. The
   score was significantly correlated to the SUVr values (r = 0.86, p <
   10(-4)). The longitudinal analysis estimated a test/retest error of
   similar or equal to 2.3\%. Cohort and longitudinal analysis suggests
   that the ELBA method accurately ranks the brain amyloid burden. The

Abstract = {{Understanding the mechanism of neuroplasticity is the first step in
   treating neuromuscular system impairments with cognitive rehabilitation
   approaches. To characterize the dynamics of the neural networks and the

   subsets to guide EEG source localization in a time-variant fashion. In
   comparison with the traditional fMRI constrained EEG source imaging
   method in a visual/motor activation task study, the proposed method
   demonstrated superior localization accuracy with lower variation and
   identified neural activity patterns that agreed well with previous
   studies. This spatiotemporal fMRI constrained source imaging method was
   then implemented in a ``sequential multievent-related potential{''}
   paradigm where motor activation is evoked by emotion-related visual

Volume = {{11}},
Pages = {{158-166}},
Abstract = {{Relational memory declines are well documented as an early marker for
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI). Episodic memory formation
   relies on relational processing supported by two mnemonic mechanisms,
   generation and binding. Neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) have primarily focused on binding deficits
   which are thought to be mediated by medial temporal lobe dysfunction. In
   this study, prefrontal contributions to relational encoding were also
   investigated using fMRI by parametrically manipulating generation
   demands during the encoding of word triads. Participants diagnosed with
   aMCI and healthy control subjects encoded word triads consisting of a
   category word with either, zero, one, or two semantically related
   exemplars. As the need to generate increased (i.e., two-to one-to
   zero-link triads), both groups recruited a core set of regions
   associated with the encoding of word triads including the
   parahippocampal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and superior parietal
   lobule. Participants diagnosed with aMCI also parametrically recruited
   several frontal regions including the inferior frontal gyrus and middle
   frontal gyrus as the need to generate increased, whereas the control
   participants did not show this modulation. While there is some
   functional overlap in regions recruited by generation demands between
   the groups, the recruitment of frontal regions in the aMCI participants
   coincides with worse memory performance, likely representing a form of
   neural inefficiency associated with Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2016 The

Year = {{2016}},
Abstract = {{Dementia is a growing problem that affects elderly people worldwide.
   More accurate evaluation of dementia diagnosis can help during the
   medical examination. Several methods for computer-aided dementia
   diagnosis have been proposed using resonance imaging scans to
   discriminate between patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls (NC). Nonetheless, the
   computer-aided diagnosis is especially challenging because of the
   heterogeneous and intermediate nature of MCI. We address the automated
   dementia diagnosis by introducing a novel supervised pretraining
   approach that takes advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) for
   complex classification tasks. The proposal initializes an ANN based on
   linear projections to achieve more discriminating spaces. Such
   projections are estimated by maximizing the centered kernel alignment
   criterion that assesses the affinity between the resonance imaging data
   kernel matrix and the label target matrix. As a result, the performed
   linear embedding allows accounting for features that contribute the most
   to the MCI class discrimination. We compare the supervised pretraining
   approach to two unsupervised initialization methods (autoencoders and
   Principal Component Analysis) and against the best four performing
   classification methods of the 2014 CADDementia challenge. As a result,
   our proposal outperforms all the baselines (7\% of classification
   accuracy and area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve) at
   the time it reduces the class biasing.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA)
   is associated with underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and
   characterized by impaired single word retrieval and repetition of
   phrases and sentences.
   Objective: We set out to study whether logopenic aphasia is indeed the
   prototypic language profile in PPA patients with biomarker evidence of
   underlying AD pathology and to correlate language profiles with cortical
   atrophy patterns on MRI.
   Methods: Inclusion criteria: (I) clinical diagnosis of PPA; (II) CSF
   profile and/or PiB-PET scan indicative for amyloid pathology; (III)
   availability of expert language evaluation. Based on language
   evaluation, patients were classified as lvPPA (fulfilling lvPPA core
   criteria), lvPPA extended (fulfilling core criteria plus other language
   disturbances), or PPA unclassifiable (not fulfilling lvPPA core
   criteria). Cortical atrophy patterns on MRI were visually rated and
   quantitative measurements of cortical thickness were performed using
   FreeSurfer.
   Results: We included 22 patients (age 67 +/- 7 years, 50\% female,
   MMSE21 +/- 6). 41\% were classified as lvPPA, 36\% as lvPPA extended
   with additional deficits in language comprehension and/or confrontation
   naming, and 23\% as PPA unclassifiable. By both qualitative and
   quantitative measurements, patients with lvPPA showed mild global
   cortical atrophy on MRI, whereas patients with lvPPA extended showed
   more focal cortical atrophy, predominantly at the left tempo-parietal
   side. For PPA unclassifiable, qualitative measurements revealed a
   heterogeneous atrophy pattern.
   Conclusion: Although most patients fulfilled the lvPPA criteria, we
   found that their language profiles were heterogeneous. The clinical and
   radiological spectrum of PPA due to underlying AD pathology is broader
   than pure lvPPA.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the
   central nervous system that has no cure and leads to death. One of the
   most prevalent tools for AD diagnosis is magnetic resonance imaging
   (MRI), because of its capability to visualize brain anatomical
   structures. There is a variety of classification methods for automatic
   diagnosis of AD, such as support vector machines, genetic algorithms,
   Bayes classifiers, neural networks, random forests, etc., but none of
   them provides robust information about the stage of the AD, they can
   just reveal the presence of disease.
   In this paper, a new approach for classification of MRI images using a
   fuzzy inference system is proposed. Two statistical moments (mean and
   standard deviation) of 116 anatomical regions of interests (ROIs) are
   used as input features for the classification system. A t-test feature
   selection method is used to identify the most discriminative ROIs. In
   order to evaluate the proposed system, MRI images from a database
   consisting of 818 subjects (229 normal, 401 mild cognitive impairment
   and 188 AD subjects) collected from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging
   initiative (ADNI) is analyzed. The receiver operating characteristics
   (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) of the proposed fuzzy
   inference system fed by statistical input features are employed as the
   evaluation criteria with k-fold cross validation. The proposed system

Abstract = {{Although measurement of total hippocampal volume is considered as an
   important hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence
   demonstrated that atrophies of hippocampal subregions might be more
   sensitive in predicting this neurodegenerative disease. The vast
   majority of neuroimaging papers investigating this topic are focused on
   the difference between AD and patients with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), not considering the impact of MCI patients who will or not
   convert in AD. For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine
   if measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total
   hippocampal volume for discriminating these groups. Hippocampal
   subfields volumetry was extracted in 55 AD, 32 converted and 89
   not-converted MCI (c/nc-MCI) and 47 healthy controls, using an
   atlas-based automatic algorithm based on Markov random fields embedded
   in the Freesurfer framework. To evaluate the impact of hippocampal
   atrophy in discriminating the insurgence of AD-like phenotypes we used
   three classification methods: Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayesian
   Classifier and Neural Networks Classifier. Taking into account only the
   total hippocampal volume, all classification models, reached a
   sensitivity of about 66\% in discriminating between c-MCI and nc-MCI.
   Otherwise, classification analysis considering all segmenting subfields
   increased accuracy to diagnose c-MCI from 68\% to 72\%. This effect
   resulted to be strongly dependent upon atrophies of the subiculum and
   presubiculum. Our multivariate analysis revealed that the magnitude of
   the difference considering hippocampal subfield volumetry, as segmented
   by the considered atlas-based automatic algorithm, offers an advantage
   over hippocampal volume in distinguishing early AD from nc-MCI.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a clinically, anatomically and biologically
   heterogeneous disorder encompassing a wide spectrum of cognitive
   profiles, ranging from the typical amnestic syndrome to visuospatial
   changes in posterior cortical atrophy, language deficits in primary
   progressive aphasia and behavioural/executive dysfunctions in anterior
   variants. With the emergence of functional imaging and neural network
   analysis using graph theory for instance, some authors have hypothesized
   that this phenotypic variability is produced by the differential
   involvement of large-scale neural networks - a model called `molecular
   nexopathy'. At the moment, however, the hypothesized mechanisms
   underlying AD's divergent network degeneration remain speculative and
   mostly involve selective premorbid network vulnerability. Herein we
   present an overview of AD's clinicoanatomical variability, outline
   functional imaging and graph theory contributions to our understanding
   of the disease and discuss ongoing debates regarding the biological
   roots of its heterogeneity. We finally discuss the clinical promises of
   statistical signal processing disciplines (graph theory and information
   theory) in predicting the trajectory of AD variants. This paper aims to
   raise awareness about AD clinicoanatomical heterogeneity and outline how
   statistical signal processing methods could lead to a better

Abstract = {{Background: Considering that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is untreatable,
   early diagnosis of AD from the healthy elderly controls (HC) is pivotal.
   However, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were not widely used due
   to its poor performance.
   Objective: Inspired from the eigenface approach for face recognition
   problems, we proposed an eigenbrain to detect AD brains. Eigenface is
   only for 2D image processing and is not suitable for volumetric image
   processing since faces are usually obtained as 2D images.
   Methods: We extended the eigenbrain to 3D. This 3D eigenbrain (3D-EB)
   inherits the fundamental strategies in either eigenface or 2D eigenbrain
   (2D-EB). All the 3D brains were transferred to a feature space, which
   encoded the variation among known 3D brain images. The feature space was
   named as the 3D-EB, and defined as eigenvectors on the set of 3D brains.
   We compared four different classifiers: feed-forward neural network,
   support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel, polynomial (Pol)
   kernel, and radial basis function kernel.
   Results: The 50x10-fold stratified cross validation experiments showed
   that the proposed 3D-EB is better than the 2-DEB. SVM with Pol kernel
   performed the best among all classifiers. Our ``3D-EB + Pol-SVM{''}
   achieved an accuracy of 92.81\% +/- 1.99\%, a sensitivity of 92.07\% +/-
   2.48\%, a specificity of 93.02\% +/- 2.22\%, and a precision of 79.03\%
   +/- 2.37\%. Based on the most important 3D-EB U-1, we detected 34 brain
   regions related with AD. The results corresponded to recent literature.
   Conclusions: We validated the effectiveness of the proposed 3D-EB by
   detecting subjects and brain regions related to AD.}},

Abstract = {{There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Some studies have focused on pause production, revealing
   that patients make extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been
   attributed to lexical retrieval difficulties, but pausing may also
   reflect other forms of cognitive impairment as it increases with
   cognitive load. The aim of the present study was to analyze
   autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective,
   looking at pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our
   first objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the
   cognitive and neuroanatomical correlates of these changes. Fifteen
   patients with MCI due to AD and 15 matched cognitively normal controls
   underwent an ecological episodic memory task, a full neuropsychological
   assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI scans. Autobiographical discourse
   collected from the ecological episodic memory task was recorded,
   transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup comparisons
   showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than controls
   overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses. The number of
   these specific pauses was positively correlated with patients' episodic
   memory performance. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis showed that, in
   the patient group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar
   area (BA 10) grey matter density. This region may therefore play an
   important role in the planning of autobiographical discourse production.
   These findings demonstrate that pauses in early AD may reflect a
   compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel and memory
   retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampal complex is affected early in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Increasingly, altered functional connectivity of the hippocampus is
   recognized as an important feature of preclinical AD. Carriers of the
   APOE epsilon 4 allele are at an increased risk for AD, which could lead
   to altered hippocampal connectivity even in healthy older adults. To
   test this hypothesis, we used a paired-associates memory task to examine
   differences in task-dependent functional connectivity of the anterior
   and posterior hippocampus in nondemented APOE epsilon 4 carriers (n =
   34, 18F) and noncarriers (n = 46, 31F). We examined anterior and
   posterior portions of the hippocampus separately to test the theory that
   APOE epsilon 4-mediated differences would be more pronounced in the
   anterior region, which is affected earlier in the AD course. This study
   is the first to use a psychophysiological interaction approach to query
   the context-dependent connectivity of subregions of the hippocampus
   during a memory task in adults at increased genetic risk for AD. During
   encoding, APOE epsilon 4 carriers had lower functional connectivity
   change compared to baseline between the anterior hippocampus and right
   precuneus, anterior insula and cingulate cortex. During retrieval,
   bilateral supramarginal gyrus and right precuneus showed lower
   functional connectivity change with anterior hippocampus in carriers.
   Also during retrieval, carriers showed lower connectivity change in the
   posterior hippocampus with auditory cortex. In each case, APOE epsilon 4
   carriers showed strong negative connectivity changes compared to
   noncarriers where positive connectivity change was measured. These
   differences may represent prodromal functional changes mediated in part
   by APOE epsilon 4 and are consistent with the anterior-to-posterior
   theory of AD progression in the hippocampus. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {{Destination memory is the process of remembering to whom we tell
   particular things. Although recent behavioral studies have clarified the
   cognitive nature of destination memory, the neural mechanisms underlying
   destination memory retrieval remain unclear. We used functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) to determine whether the medial temporal lobe
   (MTL), a structure that has been implicated in recollection-based
   memory, is activated during the successful retrieval of destination
   information. During a study phase before fMRI scanning, the subjects
   told a series of facts to either a woman or a man. During fMRI scanning,
   the subjects were asked to judge whether each fact presented was old or
   new, and if they judged it as old, to indicate, including a confidence
   rating (high or low), whether the subjects had told that fact to either
   a man or a woman. We found that successful destination retrieval, when
   compared to failed destination retrieval, was associated with increased
   activity in the parahippocampal gyrus. We also found that the confidence
   level (high vs. low) for destination memory retrieval was associated
   with increased activity in another (posterior) region of the
   parahippocampal gyrus. The present study suggests that the successful
   retrieval of destination information depends highly on MTL-mediated

Abstract = {{Background: Within the past decade, computer scientists have developed
   many methods using computer vision and machine learning techniques to
   detect Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its early stages.
   Objective: However, some of these methods are unable to achieve
   excellent detection accuracy, and several other methods are unable to
   locate AD-related regions. Hence, our goal was to develop a novel AD
   brain detection method.
   Methods: In this study, our method was based on the three-dimensional
   (3D) displacement-field (DF) estimation between subjects in the healthy
   elder control group and AD group. The 3D-DF was treated with AD-related
   features. The three feature selection measures were used in the
   Bhattacharyya distance, Student's t-test, and Welch's t-test (WTT). Two
   non-parallel support vector machines, i.e., generalized eigenvalue
   proximal support vector machine and twin support vector machine (TSVM),
   were then used for classification. A 50x10-fold cross validation was
   implemented for statistical analysis.
   Results: The results showed that ``3D-DF+WTT+TSVM{''} achieved the best
   performance, with an accuracy of 93.05 +/- 2.18, a sensitivity of 92.57
   +/- 3.80, a specificity of 93.18 +/- 3.35, and a precision of 79.51 +/-
   2.86. This method also exceled in 13 state-of-the-art approaches.
   Additionally, we were able to detect 17 regions related to AD by using
   the pure computer-vision technique. These regions include sub-gyral,
   inferior parietal lobule, precuneus, angular gyrus, lingual gyrus,
   supramarginal gyrus, postcentral gyrus, third ventricle, superior
   parietal lobule, thalamus, middle temporal gyrus, precentral gyrus,
   superior temporal gyrus, superior occipital gyrus, cingulate gyrus,

   Conclusions: The 3D-DF is effective in AD subject and related region

Abstract = {{Many objects seen for the first time look familiar because they resemble

   people who experienced a first episode of psychosis (FEP). Recollection
   of old items is impaired in this clinical population but it has not yet
   been demonstrated that this impairment influences the processing of new
   items. Eighteen FEP participants and 19 healthy controls completed an
   episodic memory task consisting of a study phase and a recognition
   phase. All the new objects looked familiar because they resembled the
   studied objects. Brain activity underlying false recognition and correct
   rejection of new objects was measured with functional resonance magnetic

   activity in the left middle frontal gyrus, the left inferior parietal

Abstract = {{Previous research has shown that there is considerable overlap in the
   neural networks mediating successful memory encoding and retrieval.
   However, little is known about how the relevant human brain regions
   interact during these distinct phases of memory or how such interactions
   are affected by memory deficits that characterize mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI), a condition that often precedes dementia due to
   Alzheimer's disease. Here we employed multivariate Granger causality
   analysis using autoregressive modeling of inferred neuronal time series
   obtained by deconvolving the hemodynamic response function from measured
   blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time series data, in order to
   examine the effective connectivity between brain regions during
   successful encoding and/or retrieval of object location associations in
   MCI patients and comparable healthy older adults. During encoding,
   healthy older adults demonstrated a left hemisphere dominant pattern
   where the inferior frontal junction, anterior intraparietal sulcus
   (likely involving the parietal eye fields), and posterior cingulate
   cortex drove activation inmost left hemisphere regions and virtually
   every right hemisphere region tested. These regions are part of a
   frontoparietal network that mediates top-down cognitive control and is
   implicated in successful memory formation. In contrast, in the MCI
   patients, the right frontal eye field drove activation in every left
   hemisphere region examined, suggesting reliance on more basic visual
   search processes. Retrieval in the healthy older adults was primarily
   driven by the right hippocampus with lesser contributions of the right
   anterior thalamic nuclei and right inferior frontal sulcus, consistent
   with theoretical models holding the hippocampus as critical for the
   successful retrieval of memories. The pattern differed in MCI patients,
   in whom the right inferior frontal junction and right anterior thalamus
   drove successful memory retrieval, reflecting the characteristic
   hippocampal dysfunction of these patients. These findings demonstrate
   that neural network interactions differ markedly between MCI patients
   and healthy older adults. Future efforts will investigate the impact of
   cognitive rehabilitation of memory on these connectivity patterns.

Abstract = {{Background: The parahippocampal gyrus (PHG) is an important region of
   the limbic system that plays an important role in episodic memory.
   Elucidation of the PHG connectivity pattern will aid in the
   understanding of memory deficits in neurodegenerative diseases.
   Objective: To investigate if disease severity associated altered PHG
   connectivity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) exists.
   Methods: We evaluated resting-state functional magnetic resonance
   imaging data from 18 patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), 35 patients with AD, and 21 controls. The PHG connectivity
   pattern was examined by calculating Pearson's correlation coefficients
   between the bilateral PHG and whole brain. Group comparisons were
   performed after controlling for the effects of age and gender. The
   functional connectivity strength in each identified region was
   correlated with the MMSE score to evaluate the relationship between
   connectivity and cognitive ability.
   Results: Several brain regions of the default mode network showed
   reduced PHG connectivity in the AD patients, and PHG connectivity was
   associated with disease severity in the MCI and AD subjects. More
   importantly, correlation analyses showed that there were positive
   correlations between the connectivity strengths of the left PHG-PCC/Pcu
   and left PHG-left MTG and the Mini-Mental State Examination, indicating
   that with disease progression from MCI to severe AD, damage to the
   functional connectivity of the PHG becomes increasingly severe.
   Conclusions: These results indicate that disease severity is associated
   with altered PHG connectivity, contributing to knowledge about the
   reduction in cognitive ability and impaired brain activity that occur in
   AD/MCI. These early changes in the functional connectivity of the PHG
   might provide some potential clues for identification of imaging markers
   for the early detection of MCI and AD.}},

Abstract = {{Background: The choice of biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) is important for improving the accuracy of imaging-based
   prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. The
   primary goal of this study was to assess the effects of imaging
   modalities and brain atlases on prediction. We also investigated the
   influence of support vector machine recursive feature elimination
   (SVM-RFE) on predictive performance.
   Methods: Eighty individuals with amnestic MCI {[}40 developed AD within
   3 years] underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans at
   baseline. Using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and LONI
   Probabilistic Brain Atlas (LPBA40), we extracted features representing
   gray matter density and relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in
   each region of interest from the baseline MRI and FDG-PET data,
   respectively. We used linear SVM ensemble with bagging and computed the
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a
   measure of classification performance. We performed multiple SVM-RFE to
   compute feature ranking. We performed analysis of variance on the mean
   AUCs for eight feature sets.
   Results: The interactions between atlas and modality choices were
   significant. The main effect of SVM-RFE was significant, but the
   interactions with the other factors were not significant.
   Comparison with existing method: Multimodal features were found to be
   better than unimodal features to predict AD. FDG-PET was found to be
   better than MRI.
   Conclusions: Imaging modalities and brain atlases interact with each
   other and affect prediction. SVM-RFE an improve the predictive accuracy
   when using atlas-based features. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: The heterogeneous clinical features of essential tremor
   indicate that the dysfunctions of this syndrome are not confined to
   motor networks, but extend to nonmotor networks. Currently, these neural
   network dysfunctions in essential tremor remain unclear. In this study,
   independent component analysis of resting-state functional MRI was used
   to study these neural network mechanisms.
   Methods: Thirty-five essential tremor patients and 35 matched healthy
   controls with clinical and neuropsychological tests were included, and
   eight resting-state networks were identified. After considering the
   structure and head-motion factors and testing the reliability of the
   selected resting-state networks, we assessed the functional connectivity
   changes within or between resting-state networks. Finally,
   image-behavior correlation analysis was performed.
   Results: Compared to healthy controls, essential tremor patients
   displayed increased functional connectivity in the sensorimotor and
   salience networks and decreased functional connectivity in the
   cerebellum network. Additionally, increased functional network
   connectivity was observed between anterior and posterior default mode
   networks, and a decreased functional network connectivity was noted
   between the cerebellum network and the sensorimotor and posterior
   default mode networks. Importantly, the functional connectivity changes
   within and between these resting-state networks were correlated with the
   tremor severity and total cognitive scores of essential tremor patients.
   Conclusions: The findings of this study provide the first evidence that
   functional connectivity changes within and between multiple
   resting-state networks are associated with tremors and cognitive
   features of essential tremor, and this work demonstrates a potential
   approach for identifying the underlying neural network mechanisms of
   this syndrome. (C) 2015 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder

Abstract = {{We explored a novel method to electrophysiologically measure
   visuo-spatial recognition memory using a modified version of the Virtual
   Tray of Objects Task (VTOT). Event-related potentials (ERP) were
   recorded from 18 healthy volunteers during performance in the VTOT.
   Participants were required to detect random repetitions of
   three-dimensional visual stimuli (OLD) and to refrain from responding to
   non-repeated stimuli (NEW). Differences in ERP between the NEW and OLD
   conditions were tested for statistical significance using
   assumption-free non-parametric analyses. Further, a correlation between
   ERP and behavioral measures was sought. Significant OLD-NEW effects were
   found for four ERP components showing distinct spatio-temporal
   characteristics: a posterior positive component appearing at 100 ms
   (P100), a left-lateralized negative component pealcing at approximate to
   250 ms (N250), a frontal negative component at approximate to 300-450 ms
   (FN400), and a right late frontal negativity (rLFN) at approximate to
   500-720 ms. Moreover, individual differences in the OLD-NEW effect
   computed for the rLFN positively correlated with repeated stimulus
   recognition efficiency. However, there were no late left parietal P600
   old/new effects. These findings suggest that the P100 component might
   reflect early visual perception processes taking place during
   performance in the task, whereas the N250 and FN400 components could be
   linked to stimulus-dependent access to visual memory representations and
   familiarity-related processes, respectively. In contrast, we propose
   that the rLFN component could be associated with higher-level cognitive
   functions, such as attention and monitoring processes. Altogether, our
   results suggest that the ERP version of the VTOT could play a role in
   the electrophysiological assessment of visuo-spatial memory and related
   sub-processes. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   Compared to controls, svPPAs told more stories and autobiographical
   stories, and perseverated on aspects of self during the interaction,

Abstract = {{The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD)
   may be optimal for clinical trials to test potential treatments for
   preventing or delaying decline to dementia. However, MCI is
   heterogeneous in that not all cases progress to dementia within the time
   frame of a trial and some may not have underlying AD pathology.
   Identifying those MCIs who are most likely to decline during a trial and
   thus most likely to benefit from treatment will improve trial efficiency
   and power to detect treatment effects. To this end, using multimodal,
   imaging-derived, inclusion criteria may be especially beneficial. Here,
   we present a novel multimodal imaging marker that predicts future
   cognitive and neural decline from {[}F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose positron
   emission tomography (PET), amyloid florbetapir PET, and structural
   magnetic resonance imaging, based on a new deep learning algorithm
   (randomized denoising autoencoder marker, rDAm). Using ADNI2 MCI data,

Abstract = {{Associative memory is essential to everyday activities, such as the
   binding of faces and corresponding names to form single bits of
   information. However, this ability often becomes impaired with
   increasing age. The most important neural substrate of associative
   memory is the hippocampus, a structure crucially implicated in the
   pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main aim of this study was
   to compare neural correlates of associative memory in healthy aging and
   mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an at-risk state for AD. We used fMRI
   to investigate differences in brain activation and connectivity between
   young controls (n = 20), elderly controls (n = 32) and MCI patients (n =
   21) during associative memory retrieval. We observed lower hippocampal
   activation in MCI patients than control groups during a face-name
   recognition task, and the magnitude of this decrement was correlated
   with lower associative memory performance. Further, increased activation
   in precentral regions in all older adults indicated a stronger
   involvement of the task positive network (TPN) with age. Finally,
   functional connectivity analysis revealed a stronger link of hippocampal
   and striatal components in older adults in comparison to young controls,
   regardless of memory impairment. In elderly controls, this went
   hand-in-hand with a stronger activation of striatal areas. Increased TPN
   activation may be linked to greater reliance on cognitive control in
   both older groups, while increased functional connectivity between the
   hippocampus and the striatum may suggest dedifferentiation, especially
   in elderly controls.}},

Abstract = {{To classify brain images into pathological or healthy is a key

   resonance images. First, we used weighted-type fractional Fourier
   transform (WFRFT) to extract spectrums from each magnetic resonance
   image. Second, we used principal component analysis (PCA) to reduce
   spectrum features to only 26. Third, those reduced spectral features of
   different samples were combined and were fed into support vector machine
   (SVM) and its two variants: generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM and twin
   SVM. A 5 x 5-fold cross-validation results showed that this proposed
   WFRFT+PCA+generalized eigenvalue proximal SVM yielded sensitivity of
   99.53\%, specificity of 92.00\%, precision of 99.53\%, and accuracy of

   better than the proposed WFRFT+PCA+SVM. Besides, all three proposed

Abstract = {{The loss of an only child is a negative life event and may potentially

   used to examine network communication in 22 older adults who lost their
   only child and 23 matched controls. The older adults who lost their only
   child exhibited an ineffective coping style. They also showed decreased
   distant and local DC in the precuneus and left inferior parietal lobule

   regions and the decreased DLPFC-precuneus connectivity strength were
   negatively correlated with negative coping scores in the loss group but

Abstract = {{Affective mentalizing involves the integration of various social signals
   in order to infer the affective states of others. Previous neuroimaging
   studies have shown that the medial prefrontal cortex, the

   constitute the core affective mentalizing network. However, the relative
   contributions of these regions to affective mentalizing remain unclear.
   We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which of
   these nodes are involved in the integration of two social signals:
   emotional tears and facial expressions. We assumed that this integration
   would produce a supra-additive effect, indicated by greater activity
   than the sum of the effects of the individual social signals. Female
   subjects rated the sadness of faces with either tears or tear-like
   circles, and either sad or neutral expressions. We observed the
   supra-additive effect in the medial prefrontal cortex and
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex but not in the temporo-parietal

Title = {{Pathological brain detection in MRI scanning by wavelet packet Tsallis

Abstract = {{An computer-aided diagnosis system of pathological brain detection (PBD)
   is important for help physicians interpret and analyze medical images.
   We proposed a novel automatic PBD to distinguish pathological brains
   from healthy brains in magnetic resonance imaging scanning in this
   paper. The proposed method simplified the PBD problem to a binary
   classification task. We extracted the wavelet packet Tsallis entropy
   (WPTE) from each brain image. The WPTE is the Tsallis entropy of the
   coefficients of the discrete wavelet packet transform. The, the features
   were submitted to the fuzzy support vector machine (FSVM). We tested the
   proposed diagnosis method on 3 benchmark datasets with different sizes.
   A ten runs of K-fold stratified cross validation was carried out. The
   results demonstrated that the proposed WPTE + FSVM method excelled 17
   state-of-the-art methods w.r.t. classification accuracy. The WPTE is
   superior to discrete wavelet transform. The Tsallis entropy performs
   better than Shannon entropy. The FSVM excels standard SVM. In closing,
   the proposed method ``WPTE + FSVM{''} is effective in PBD.}},

   definition of a small peri-hippocampal region to target the atlas
   learning with linear and non-linear embedded manifolds. All atlases were
   co-registered to a data driven template resulting in a computationally
   efficient method that requires only one test registration. The optimal
   atlases identified were used to train dedicated artificial neural
   networks whose labels were then propagated and fused to obtain the final
   segmentation. To quantify data heterogeneity and protocol inherent
   effects, HUMAN was tested on two independent data sets provided by the
   Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Open Access Series

   scores (p < .001), their performance on the easier AM fMRI task was
   efficiently carried out, allowing relevant comparisons with healthy
   controls. Relatively to healthy controls, the patients showed increased
   and bilateral cerebral activations (p < .005) during the construction
   and elaboration phases. The prefrontal, temporal and posterior cerebral
   region activations were located within the core network sustaining AM,
   with the bilateral prefrontal region being centrally involved. The

Title = {{Apathy in Frontotemporal Degeneration: Neuroanatomical Evidence of
   Impaired Goal-directed Behavior}},
Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{9}},
Month = {{NOV 10}},
Abstract = {{Background: Apathy, the major manifestation of impaired goal-directed
   behavior (GDB), is the most common neuropsychiatric syndrome associated
   with behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration (bvFTD). The
   behavioral and biological mechanisms of apathy, however, are not well
   understood. We hypothesized that GDB has multiple components including
   at least initiation, planning and motivation and that GDB is supported
   by a network of multiple frontal brain regions. In this study, we
   examined this hypothesis by evaluating the selective breakdown of GDB in
   bvFTD, and relating these deficits to gray matter (GM) atrophy and white
   matter(WM) integrity.
   Methods: Eighteen apathetic bvFTD participants and 17 healthy controls
   completed the Philadelphia Apathy Computerized Test (PACT). This test
   quantifies each of three components of GDB hypothesized to contribute to
   apathy. We then used regression analyses to relate PACT scores to GM
   atrophy and reduced white matter pm) fractional anisotropy (FA) in
   bvFTD.
   Results: Compared to controls, bvFTD participants demonstrated
   significant impairments in each of the three hypothesized components of
   GDB that contribute to apathy. Regression analyses related each
   component to disease in specific GM structures and associated VVM
   tracts. Poor initiation thus was related to GM atrophy in anterior
   cingulate and reduced FA in the cingulum. Planning impairment was
   related to GM atrophy in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and reduced FA
   in superior longitudinal fasciculus. Poor motivation was related to GM
   atrophy in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and reduced FA in uncinate
   fasciculus (UNC).
   Conclusions: bvFTD patients have difficulty with initiation, planning
   and motivation components of GDB. These findings are consistent with the
   hypotheses that GDB encompasses at least three processes, that these are
   supported by a large-scale neural network within specific portions of
   the frontal lobe, and that degradation of any one of these prefrontal
   regions in bvFTD may contribute to apathy.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is associated with the
   accumulation of wild-type human alpha-synuclein (SYN) in neurons and
   with prominent slowing of brain oscillations on electroencephalography
   (EEG). However, it remains uncertain whether the EEG abnormalities are
   actually caused by SYN. Methods: To determine whether SYN can cause
   neural network abnormalities, we performed EEG recordings and analyzed
   the expression of neuronal activity-dependent gene products in SYN
   transgenic mice. We also carried out comparative analyses in humans with
   DLB. Results: We demonstrate that neuronal expression of SYN in
   transgenic mice causes a left shift in spectral power that closely
   resembles the EEG slowing observed in DLB patients. Surprisingly, SYN
   mice also had seizures and showed molecular hippocampal alterations
   indicative of aberrant network excitability, including calbindin
   depletion in the dentate gyrus. In postmortem brain tissues from DLB
   patients, we found reduced levels of calbindin mRNA in the dentate
   gyrus. Furthermore, nearly one quarter of DLB patients showed myoclonus,
   a clinical sign of aberrant network excitability that was associated
   with an earlier age of onset of cognitive impairments. In SYN mice,
   partial suppression of epileptiform activity did not alter their shift
   in spectral power. Furthermore, epileptiform activity in human amyloid
   precursor protein transgenic mice was not associated with a left shift
   in spectral power. Interpretation: We conclude that neuronal
   accumulation of SYN slows brain oscillations and, in parallel, causes
   aberrant network excitability that can escalate into seizure activity.
   The potential role of aberrant network excitability in DLB merits
   further investigation.}},

Abstract = {{Changes in working memory are sensitive indicators of both normal and

   aims to further understanding of working memory in normal aging using a
   large cohort of healthy elderly in order to examine three separate

   Using covariance analysis, increasing and decreasing neural activation
   was observed on fMRI in response to a delayed item recognition task in
   337 cognitively healthy elderly persons as part of the CRESCENDO
   (Cognitive REServe and Clinical ENDOphenotypes) study.
   During three phases of the task (stimulation, retention, probe),
   increased activation was observed with increasing task load in bilateral
   regions of the prefrontal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus,
   insula and in deep gray matter nuclei, suggesting an involvement of
   central executive and salience networks. Decreased activation associated
   with increasing task load was observed during the stimulation phase, in
   bilateral temporal cortex, parietal lobule, cingulate gyrus and
   prefrontal cortex. This spatial distribution of decreased activation is
   suggestive of the default mode network.
   These findings support the hypothesis of an increased activation in

Abstract = {{Proactive interference (Pi) refers to the finding that memory for
   recently studied (target) material can be impaired by the prior study of
   other (nontarget) material. Previous accounts of PI differed in whether
   they attributed PI to impaired retrieval or impaired encoding. Here, we
   suggest an integrated encoding-retrieval account, which assigns a role
   for each of the 2 types of processes in buildup of PI. Employing a
   typical PI task, we examined (a) the role of encoding processes in PI
   by- recording scalp EEG during study of nontarget and target lists, and
   (b) the role of retrieval processes in PI by measuring recall totals and
   response latencies in target list recall. In addition, we measured
   subjects' working memory capacity (WNW). Behaviorally, the PI effect
   arose in both recall totals and response latencies, indicating PI at the
   sampling and the recovery stage of recall. Neurally, we found an
   increase in electrophysiological activities in the theta frequency band
   (5-8 Hz) from nontarget to target list encoding, indicating an increase
   in memory load during tai-get list encoding. The results demonstrate
   that impaired retrieval and impaired encoding can contribute to PI.
   `They also show that WMC affects PI. For both encoding and retrieNW
   processes. PI was reduced in high-WMC subjects, suggesting that those
   subjects are able to separate target from nontarget information and
   create stronger focus on the target material.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: To investigate the longitudinal brain regional homogeneity

   Methods: Three adult female rhesus monkeys underwent unilateral thoracic

   healthy stage and 4, 8, and 12 weeks after the injury. The ReHo value of
   each voxel in the monkey brain was calculated and compared between pre-

   between the ReHo change and the time after injury were also determined.
   Results: Compared with those in healthy period, the ReHo values of the

Abstract = {{Several studies of semantic memory in non-musical domains involving
   recognition of items from long-term memory have shown an age related
   shift from the medial temporal lobe structures to the frontal lobe.
   However, the effects of aging on musical semantic memory remain
   unexamined. We compared activation associated with recognition of
   familiar melodies in younger and older adults. Recognition follows
   successful retrieval from the musical lexicon that comprises a lifetime
   of learned musical phrases. We used the sparse-sampling technique in
   fMRI to determine the neural correlates of melody recognition by
   comparing activation when listening to familiar vs. unfamiliar melodies,
   and to identify age differences. Recognition related cortical activation
   was detected in the right superior temporal, bilateral inferior and
   superior frontal, left middle orbitofrontal, bilateral precentral, and
   left supramarginal gyri. Region-of-interest analysis showed greater
   activation for younger adults in the left superior temporal gyms and for
   older adults in the left superior frontal, left angular, and bilateral
   superior parietal regions. Our study provides powerful evidence for
   these musical memory networks due to a large sample (N = 40) that

Abstract = {{The purpose of this study was to investigate associative learning
   effects in patients with prodromal Alzheimer's disease (prAD) by
   referring to the Temporal Context Model (TCM; Howard, Jing, Rao, Provyn,
   \& Datey, 2009), in an attempt to enhance the understanding of their
   associative memory impairment. TCM explains fundamental effects
   described in classical free-recall tasks and cued-recall tasks involving
   overlapping word pairs (e.g., A-B, B-C), namely (1) the contiguity
   effect, which is the tendency to successively recall nearby items in a
   list, and (2) the observation of backward (i.e., B-A) and transitive
   associations (i.e., A-C) between items. In TCM, these effects are
   hypothesized to rely on contextual representation, binding and retrieval
   processes, which supposedly depend on hippocampal and parahippocampal
   regions. As these regions are affected in prAD, the current study
   investigated whether prAD patients would show reduced proportions of
   backward and transitive associations in free and cued-recall, coupled to
   a reduced contiguity effect in free-recall. Seventeen older controls and
   17 prAD patients performed a cued-recall task involving overlapping word
   pairs and a final free-recall task. Proportions of backward and
   transitive intrusions in cued-recall did not significantly differ
   between groups. However, in free-recall, prAD patients demonstrated a
   reduced contiguity effect as well as reduced proportions of backward and

Abstract = {{Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline and underlying brain
   dysfunction. Previous studies concentrated less on brain network changes
   at a systems level. Our goal was to examine these age-related changes of
   fMRI-derived activation with a common network parcellation of the human
   brain function, offering a systems-neuroscience perspective of healthy
   aging. We conducted a series of meta-analyses on a total of 114 studies
   that included 2035 older adults and 1845 young adults. Voxels showing
   significant age-related changes in activation were then overlaid onto
   seven commonly referenced neuronal networks. Older adults present
   moderate cognitive decline in behavioral performance during fMRI
   scanning, and hypo-activate the visual network and hyper-activate both
   the frontoparietal control and default mode networks. The degree of
   increased activation in frontoparietal network was associated with
   behavioral performance in older adults. Age-related changes in
   activation present different network patterns across cognitive domains.
   The systems neuroscience approach used here may be useful for
   elucidating the underlying network mechanisms of various brain
   plasticity processes during healthy aging. (C) 2015 The Authors.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Genome-wide association studies identify rs11136000 in the
   CLU gene, which codes for Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin, as a significant
   risk variant for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms by

   Methods: Eighty-five healthy Caucasian participants underwent functional
   magnetic resonance imaging during a working memory (WM) task and were
   genotyped for CLU rs11136000/APOE loci.
   Results: Here we show that young individuals with the CLU rs11136000
   risk variant (C) have higher activation levels in memory-related
   prefrontal and limbic areas during a WMtask. We also found subtle
   reductions in gray matter in the right hippocampal formation in carriers

   Discussion: We suggest that this pattern of multimodal imaging results

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and
   the most common type of dementia among older people. The number of
   patients with AD will grow rapidly each year and AD is the fifth leading
   cause of death for those aged 65 and older. In recent years, one of the
   main challenges for medical investigators has been the early diagnosis
   of patients with AD because an early diagnosis can provide greater
   opportunities for patients to be eligible for more clinical trials and
   they will have enough time to plan for future, medical and financial
   decisions. An established risk factor for AD is mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) which is described as a transitional state between
   normal aging and AD patients. Hence an accurate and reliable diagnosis
   of MCI can be very effective and helpful for early diagnosis of AD.
   Therefore in this paper we present a novel and efficient method based on
   pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) for the diagnosis of MCI individuals from
   AD and healthy control (HC) groups using structural MRI. The proposed
   method uses PZMs to extract discriminative information from the MR
   images of the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Two types of artificial neural
   networks, which are based on pattern recognition and learning vector
   quantization (LVQ) networks, were used to classify the information
   extracted from the MRIs. We worked with 500 MRIs from the database of
   the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1 1.5T). The 1
   slice of 500 MRIs used in this study included 180 AD patients, 172 MCI
   patients, and 148 HC individuals. We selected 50 percent of the MRIs
   randomly for use in training the classifiers, 25 percent for validation
   and we used 25 percent for the testing phase. The technique proposed
   here yielded the best overall classification results between AD and MCI
   (accuracy 94.88\%, sensitivity 94.18\%, and specificity 95.55\%), and
   for pairs of the MCI and HC (accuracy 95.59\%, sensitivity 95.89\% and
   specificity 95.34\%). These results were achieved using maximum order 30
   of PZM and the pattern recognition network with the scaled conjugate
   gradient (SCG) back-propagation training algorithm as a classifier. (C)

Abstract = {{Aim. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease.
   Recently, computer scientists have developed various methods for early

   Method. In this study, we proposed a novel AD detection method by
   displacement field (DF) estimation between a normal brain and an AD
   brain. The DF was treated as the AD-related features, reduced by
   principal component analysis (PCA), and finally fed into three
   classifiers: support vector machine (SVM), generalized eigenvalue
   proximal SVM (GEPSVM), and twin SVM (TSVM). The 10-fold cross validation
   repeated 50 times.
   Results. The results showed the ``DF + PCA + TSVM{''} achieved the
   accuracy of 92.75 +/- 1.77, sensitivity of 90.56 +/- 1.15, specificity
   of 93.37 +/- 2.05, and precision of 79.61 +/- 2.21. This result is
   better than or comparable with not only the other proposed two methods,
   but also ten state-of-the-art methods. Besides, our method discovers the
   AD is related to following brain regions disclosed in recent

Abstract = {{Introduction: The long preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease provides
   opportunities for potential disease-modifying interventions in prodromal
   stages such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Anodal transcranial
   direct current stimulation (anodal-tDCS), with its potential to enhance
   neuroplasticity, may allow improving cognition in MCI.
   Methods: In a double-blind, cross-over, sham-controlled study,
   anodal-tDCS was administered to the left inferior frontal cortex during
   task-related and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) to assess its impact on cognition and brain functions in MCI.
   Results: During sham stimulation, MCI patients produced fewer correct
   semantic-word-retrieval responses than matched healthy controls, which
   was associated with hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal regions.
   Anodal-tDCS significantly improved performance to the level of controls,
   reduced task-related prefrontal hyperactivity and resulted in
   ``normalization{''} of abnormal network configuration during

   Discussion: Anodal-tDCS exerts beneficial effects on cognition and brain

   strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed

Abstract = {{Recently, several pattern recognition methods have been proposed to
   automatically discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimer's
   disease using different imaging modalities: sMRI, fMRI, PET and SPECT.
   Classical approaches in visual information retrieval have been
   successfully used for analysis of structural MRI brain images. In this
   paper, we use the visual indexing framework and pattern recognition
   analysis based on structural MRI data to discriminate three classes of
   subjects: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approach uses the circular harmonic
   functions (CHFs) to extract local features from the most involved areas
   in the disease: hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in each
   slice in all three brain projections. The features are quantized using
   the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach to build one signature by brain
   (subject). This yields a transformation of a full 3D image of brain ROIs
   into a 1D signature, a histogram of quantized features. To reduce the
   dimensionality of the signature, we use the PCA technique. Support
   vector machines classifiers are then applied to classify groups. The
   experiments were conducted on a subset of ADNI dataset and applied to
   the ``Bordeaux-3City{''} dataset The results showed that our approach
   achieves respectively for ADNI dataset and ``Bordeaux-3City{''} dataset;
   for AD vs NC classification, an accuracy of 83.77\% and 78\%, a
   specificity of 88.2\% and 80.4\% and a sensitivity of 79.09\% and
   74.7\%. For NC vs MCI classification we achieved for the ADNI datasets
   an accuracy of 69.45\%, a specificity of 74.8\% and a sensitivity of
   62.52\%. For the most challenging classification task (AD vs MCI), we
   reached an accuracy of 62.07\%, a specificity of 75.15\% and a
   sensitivity of 49.02\%. The use of PCC visual features description
   improves classification results by more than 5\% compared to the use of
   hippocampus features only. Our approach is automatic, less
   time-consuming and does not require the intervention of the clinician

Abstract = {{Purpose The epsilon 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APO-E4) gene, a
   genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), also modulates brain
   metabolism and function in healthy subjects. The aim of the present
   study was to explore cerebral metabolism using FDG PET in healthy APO-E4
   carriers by comparing cognitively normal APO-E4 carriers to noncarriers
   and to assess if patterns of metabolism are correlated with performance
   on cognitive tasks. Moreover, metabolic connectivity patterns were
   established in order to assess if the organization of neural networks is
   influenced by genetic factors.
   Methods Whole-brain PET statistical analysis was performed at
   voxel-level using SPM8 with a threshold of p < 0.005, corrected for
   volume, with age, gender and level of education as nuisance variables.
   Significant hypometabolism between APO-E4 carriers (n = 11) and
   noncarriers (n = 30) was first determined. Mean metabolic values with
   clinical/neuropsychological data were extracted at the individual level,
   and correlations were searched using Spearman's rank test in the whole
   group. To evaluate metabolic connectivity from metabolic cluster(s)
   previously identified in the intergroup comparison, voxel-wise
   interregional correlation analysis (IRCA) was performed between groups
   of subjects.
   Results APO-E4 carriers had reduced metabolism within the left anterior
   medial temporal lobe (MTL), where neuropathological changes first appear
   in AD, including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. A correlation
   between metabolism in this area and performance on the DMS48 (delayed
   matching to sample-48 items) was found, in line with converging evidence
   involving the perirhinal cortex in object-based memory. Finally, a
   voxel-wise IRCA revealed stronger metabolic connectivity of the MTL
   cluster with neocortical frontoparietal regions in carriers than in
   noncarriers, suggesting compensatory metabolic networks.
   Conclusions Exploring cerebral metabolism using FDG PET can contribute
   to a better understanding of the influence of genetic factors on
   cerebral metabolism at both the local and network levels leading to
   phenotypical variations of the healthy brain and selective
   vulnerability.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic seizure detection technology is of great significance for
   long-term electroencephalogram (EEG) monitoring of epilepsy patients.
   The aim of this work is to develop a seizure detection system with high

   which describes the local singular behavior of fractal objects and
   characterizes the multifractal structure using a continuous spectrum.
   Compared with computing the single fractal dimension, multifractal
   analysis can provide a better description on the transient behavior of
   EEG fractal time series during the evolvement from interictal stage to
   seizures. Thus both interictal EEG and ictal EEG were analyzed by
   multifractal formalism and their differences in the multifractal
   features were used to distinguish the two class of EEG and detect
   seizures. In the proposed detection system, eight features (alpha(0),
   alpha(min), alpha(max), Delta alpha, f(alpha(min)), f(alpha(max)), Delta
   f and R) were extracted from the multifractal spectrums of the
   preprocessed EEG to construct feature vectors. Subsequently, relevance
   vector machine (RVM) was applied for EEG patterns classification, and a
   series of post-processing operations were used to increase the accuracy
   and reduce false detections. Both epoch-based and event-based evaluation
   methods were performed to appraise the system's performance on the EEG
   recordings of 21 patients in the Freiburg database. The epoch-based
   sensitivity of 92.94\% and specificity of 97.47\% were achieved, and the
   proposed system obtained a sensitivity of 92.06\% with a false detection
   rate of 0.34/h in event-based performance assessment.}},

Title = {{Aberrant connectivity within the default mode network in first-episode,
   treatment-naive major depressive disorder}},
Journal = {{JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{183}},

Abstract = {{Background: Convergent studies have highlighted the dysfunction of
   default mode network (DMN) in major depressive disorder (MDD). The
   altered connectivity in posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and medial
   prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was especially found to be of interest in the
   resting state functional connectivity analysis. Recently, more attention
   has turned to the internal functional connectivity within the DMN.
   However, the internal connection patterns within the DMN remain unclear
   at the initial onset of MDD.
   Methods: Resting-state fMRI was performed on 38 first-episode,
   treatment-naive MDD patients along with 38 matched healthy controls.
   Seed-based analysis was used to define the DMN and then a
   region-to-region connectivity analysis was performed to inspect the
   functional connectivity within the DMN. Spearman's rank correlation
   analysis was performed between significantly abnormal connectivities in
   MDD patients and clinical measurements.
   Results: Decreased region-to-region connectivities within DMN were found
   between the PCC and dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), between PCC
   and the right inferior parietal gyrus/angular, as well as between the
   left thalamus and cerebellar tonsil. No significant increase in
   connectivity was found. Moreover, functional connectivity between the
   left thalamus and cerebellar tonsil revealed a marginal significant
   negative correlation with clinical Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
   (HDRS) scores. Limitations: Noteworthiness in morbidity, a high risk of
   mortality, and a high rate of medical service utilization of MDD make
   the current results uncertain to apply to the more complicated
   situations.
   Conclusions: Each region within DMN may have a specific, individual
   functional role. The reason to identify the pathological mechanism of
   MDD may not lie in the abnormal DMN functional connectivity, but rather
   in the abnormal functional connectivity within DMN. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Background: Obesity is associated with vascular risk factors that in
   turn, may increase dementia risk. However, higher body mass index (BMI)
   in late life may be neuroprotective. The possible neural mechanisms
   underlying the benefit of higher BMI on cognition in older adults are
   largely unknown. Thus, we used functional connectivity magnetic
   resonance imaging (fcMRI) to examine: (1) the relationship between BMI
   and functional brain connectivity; and (2) the mediating role of
   functional brain connectivity in the association between baseline BMI
   and change in cognitive function over a 12-month period.
   Methods: We conducted a 12-month, prospective study among 66
   community-dwelling older adults, aged 70 to 80 years, who were
   categorized as: normal weight (BMI from 18.50 to 24.99); overweight (BMI
   from 25.00 to 29.99); and obese (BMI >= 30.00). At baseline,
   participants performed a finger-tapping task during fMRI scanning.
   Relevant neural networks were initially identified through independent
   component analysis (ICA) and subsequently examined through seed-based
   functional connectivity analysis. At baseline and 12-months, we measured
   three executive cognitive processes: (1) response inhibition; (2) set
   shifting; and (3) working memory.
   Results: Obese individuals showed lower task-related functional
   connectivity during finger tapping in the default mode network (DMN)
   compared with their healthy weight counterparts (p < 0.01). Lower
   task-related functional connectivity in the DMN at baseline was
   independently associated with better working memory performance at 12
   months (p = 0.02). Finally, DMN functional connectivity during finger
   tapping significantly mediated the relationship between baseline BMI and
   working memory at 12-months (indirect effect: -0.155, 95\% confidence
   interval {[}-0.313, -0.053]).
   Conclusions: These findings suggest that functional connectivity of the
   DMN may be an underlying mechanism by which higher BMI confers
   protective effects to cognition in late life.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: It has been suggested that overweight is negatively
   associated with cognitive functions. The aim of this study was to
   investigate whether a reduction in body weight by dietary interventions
   could improve episodic memory performance and alter associated
   functional brain responses in overweight and obese women. Methods: 20
   overweight postmenopausal women were randomized to either a modified
   paleolithic diet or a standard diet adhering to the Nordic Nutrition
   Recommendations for 6 months. We used functional magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine brain function during an episodic memory task as well
   as anthropometric and biochemical data before and after the
   interventions. Results: Episodic memory performance improved
   significantly (p = 0.010) after the dietary interventions.
   Concomitantly, brain activity increased in the anterior part of the
   right hippocampus during memory encoding, without differences between
   diets. This was associated with decreased levels of plasma free fatty
   acids (FFA). Brain activity increased in pre-frontal cortex and
   superior/middle temporal gyri. The magnitude of increase correlated with
   waist circumference reduction. During episodic retrieval, brain activity
   decreased in inferior and middle frontal gyri, and increased in
   middle/superior temporal gyri. Conclusions: Diet induced weight loss,
   associated with decreased levels of plasma FFA, improves episodic memory

Abstract = {{Unawareness of memory loss is a challenging characteristic of

   self-assessment. The subjectivity of traditional measurements of
   self-awareness in dementia has likely limited the rigor with which its

   memory awareness (metamemory) using a Feeling of Knowing (FOR) task in a

   20 cognitively healthy older adults. Performance on the metamemory task
   was examined in relation to the structural integrity of 14 bilateral

Abstract = {{Older adults experience parallel changes in sleep, circadian rhythms,
   and episodic memory. These processes appear to be linked such that
   disruptions in sleep contribute to deficits in memory. Although more
   variability in circadian patterns is a common feature of aging and
   predicts pathology, little is known about how alterations in circadian
   activity rhythms within older adults influence new episodic learning.
   Following 10 days of recording sleep-wake patterns using actigraphy,
   healthy older adults underwent fMRI while performing an associative
   memory task. The results revealed better associative memory was related
   to more consistent circadian activity rhythms, independent of total
   sleep time, sleep efficiency, and level of physical activity. Moreover,
   hippocampal activity during successful memory retrieval events was
   positively correlated with associative memory accuracy and circadian
   activity rhythm (CAR) consistency. We demonstrated that the link between
   consistent rhythms and associative memory performance was mediated by
   hippocampal activity. These findings provide novel insight into how the
   circadian rhythm of sleep-wake cycles are associated with memory in
   older adults and encourage further examination of circadian activity

Abstract = {{Background: We proposed a novel classification system to distinguish
   among elderly subjects with Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI), and normal controls (NC), based on 3D magnetic
   resonance imaging (MRI) scanning.
   Methods: The method employed 3D data of 178 subjects consisting of 97
   NCs, 57 MCIs, and 24 ADs. First, all these 3D MR images were
   preprocessed with atlas-registered normalization to form an averaged
   volumetric image. Then, 3D discrete wavelet transform (3D-DWT) was used
   to extract wavelet coefficients the volumetric image. The triplets
   (energy, variance, and Shannon entropy) of all subbands coefficients of
   3D-DWT were obtained as feature vector. Afterwards, principle component
   analysis (PCA) was applied for feature reduction. On the basic of the
   reduced features, we proposed nine classification methods: three
   individual classifiers as linear SVM, kernel SVM, and kernel SVM trained
   by PSO with time-varying acceleration-coefficient (PSOTVAC), with three
   multiclass methods as Winner-Takes-All (WTA), Max-Wins-Voting, and
   Directed Acyclic Graph.
   Results: The 5-fold cross validation results showed that the ``WTA-KSVM
   + PSOTVAC{''} performed best over the OASIS benchmark dataset, with
   overall accuracy of 81.5\% among all proposed nine classifiers.
   Moreover, the method ``WTA-KSVM + PSOTVAC{''} exceeded significantly
   existing state-of-the-art methods (accuracies of which were less than or
   equal to 74.0\%).
   Conclusion: We validate the effectiveness of 3D-DWT. The proposed
   approach has the potential to assist in early diagnosis of ADs and MCIs.

   MethodWe recruited 80 patients at different H\&Y stages of PD (28 at
   H\&Y stage I, 28 at H\&Y stage II, 24 at H\&Y stage III) and 30 normal
   controls. All participants underwent resting-state fMRI scans on a 3-T
   MR system. The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of blood
   oxygen level-dependent signals was used to characterize regional
   cerebral function. Functional integration across the brain regions was
   evaluated by a seed voxel correlation approach.
   ResultsPD patients had decreased regional activities in left occipital
   and lingual regions; these regions show decreased functional connection
   pattern with temporal regions, which is deteriorating as H\&Y stage
   ascending. In addition, PD patients, especially those at stage II,
   exhibit increased regional activity in the posterior regions of default

Abstract = {{Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a central characteristic of amnestic
   mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects, and has a high risk of
   converting to Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unknown how the
   EM network is modulated when a situation is switched. Twenty-six aMCI
   and twenty-two cognitively normal (CN) subjects were enrolled in this
   study. All of the subjects completed multi-dimensional
   neuropsychological tests and underwent functional magnetic resonance
   imaging scans during a resting-state and an episodic memory retrieval
   task state. The EM network was constructed using a seed-based functional
   connectivity (FC) approach. AMCI subjects showed poorer cognitive
   performances in the episodic memory and executive function. We
   demonstrated that connectivity of the left posterior parahippocampal
   gyrus (LpPHG) connected to the left ventral medial prefrontal cortex and
   the right postcentral gyrus (RPCG) was significantly decreased in aMCI
   subjects compared to CN subjects. Meanwhile, there was increased
   connectivity of the LpPHG to the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex
   (RDMPFC), RPCG, left inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral superior
   parietal lobe in all of the subjects that changed from a resting-state
   to a task-state. Interestingly, the changed LpPHG-RDMPFC connectivity
   strength was significantly correlated with EM scores and executive
   function in the aMCI subjects. As a result, general brain regions are
   functionally organized and integrated into the EM network, and this
   strongly suggests that more cognitive resources are mobilized to meet
   the challenge of cognitive demand in the task state. These findings
   extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of EM deficits in

Abstract = {{When searching for concepts in memoryas in the verbal fluency task of
   naming all the animals one can think ofpeople appear to explore internal
   mental representations in much the same way that animals forage in
   physical space: searching locally within patches of information before
   transitioning globally between patches. However, the definition of the
   patches being searched in mental space is not well specified. Do we
   search by activating explicit predefined categories (e.g., pets) and
   recall items from within that category (categorical search), or do we
   activate and recall a connected sequence of individual items without
   using categorical information, with each item recalled leading to the
   retrieval of an associated item in a stream (associative search), or
   both? Using semantic representations in a search of associative memory
   framework and data from the animal fluency task, we tested competing
   hypotheses based on associative and categorical search models.
   Associative, but not categorical, patch transitions took longer to make
   than position-matched productions, suggesting that categorical
   transitions were not true transitions. There was also clear evidence of
   associative search even within categorical patch boundaries.
   Furthermore, most individuals' behavior was best explained by an
   associative search model without the addition of categorical
   information. Thus, our results support a search process that does not
   use categorical information, but for which patch boundaries shift with
   each recall and local search is well described by a random walk in
   semantic space, with switches to new regions of the semantic space when
   the current region is depleted.}},

Abstract = {{Background:
   New learning and memory deficits are common following traumatic brain
   injury (TBI). Yet few studies have examined the efficacy of memory
   retraining in TBI through the most methodologically vigorous randomized
   clinical trial. Our previous research has demonstrated that the modified
   Story Memory Technique (mSMT) significantly improves new learning and
   memory in multiple sclerosis.
   Methodology:
   The present double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial
   examined changes in cerebral activation on functional magnetic resonance
   imaging following mSMT treatment in persons with TBI. Eighteen
   individuals with TBI were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 9) or
   placebo (n = 9) groups.
   Results:
   Baseline and follow-up functional magnetic resonance imaging was
   collected during a list-learning task. Significant differences in
   cerebral activation from before to after treatment were noted in regions
   belonging to the default mode network and executive control network in
   the treatment group only. Results are interpreted in light of these
   networks.
   Conclusions:
   Activation differences between the groups likely reflect increased use
   of strategies taught during treatment. This study demonstrates a
   significant change in cerebral activation resulting from the mSMT in a
   TBI sample. Findings are consistent with previous work in multiple
   sclerosis. Behavioral interventions can show significant changes in the
   brain, validating clinical utility.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction: Gender differences and menopause are associated with the
   cognitive decline and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although
   deficits of subcortical-cortical loops have been implicated in AD, no
   study has directly examined the resting-state brain functional
   alterations in postmenopausal women with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI).
   Methodology: Forty-eight subjects were recruited, including 15 older
   females with MCI, 13 older females without MCI, 10 older males with MCI
   and 10 older males without MCI. Full-scale neuropsychological tests were
   used to evaluate cognitive function. Resting-state fMRI and the
   amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) approach were used to
   investigate changes in the brain function in these subjects. A
   voxel-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA: gender x disease) was performed,
   and gender-brain-behavior relationships were further examined.
   Results: First, older females with MCI showed cognitive dysfunction in
   multiple domains compared to normal controls. Second, the brain function
   of subcortical-cortical loops was disrupted in older females with MCI.
   Finally, regional resting-state function of the left precuneus was
   significantly associated with altered episodic memory in these female
   patients.
   Conclusions: This study revealed the patterns of neural networks in

Abstract = {{In this review, the clinical, neuropsychological, and neuroimaging
   findings in the alcoholic Korsakoff syndrome and in thalamic amnesia,
   resulting from focal infarction, are compared. In both disorders, there
   is controversy over what is the critical site for anterograde amnesia to
   occur damage to the anterior thalamus/mammillo-thalamic tract has most
   commonly been cited, but damage to the medio-dorsal nuclei has also been
   advocated. Both syndromes show `core' features of an anterograde amnesic
   syndrome; but retrograde amnesia is generally much more extensive (going
   back many years or decades) in the Korsakoff syndrome. Likewise,
   spontaneous confabulation occurs more commonly in the Korsakoff
   syndrome, although seen in only a minority of chronic cases. These
   differences are attributed to the greater prevalence of frontal atrophy
   and frontal damage in Korsakoff cases. (c) 2014 The Author. Published by

Abstract = {{Not all memory processes are equally affected by aging. A widely
   accepted hypothesis is that older adults rely more on familiarity-based
   processing, typically linked with the perirhinal cortex (PRC), in the
   context of impaired recollection, linked with the hippocampus (HC).
   However, according to the dedifferentiation hypothesis, healthy aging
   reduces the specialization of MTL memory subregions so that they may
   mediate different memory processes than in young adults. Using fMRI, we
   tested this possibility using a conceptual fluency manipulation known to
   induce familiarity-related PRC activity. The study yielded two main
   findings. First, although fluency equivalently affected PRC in both
   young (18-28; N=14) and older (62-80; N=15) adults, it also uniquely
   affected HC activity in older adults. Second, the fluency manipulation
   reduced functional connectivity between HC and PRC in young adults, but
   it increased it in older adults. Taken together, the results suggest
   that aging may result in reduced specialization of the HC for
   recollection, such that the HC may be recruited when fluency increases
   familiarity-based responding.

Title = {{Detection of subjects and brain regions related to Alzheimer's disease
   using 3D MRI scans based on eigenbrain and machine learning}},

Abstract = {{Purpose: Early diagnosis or detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) from
   the normal elder control (NC) is very important. However, the
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) was not widely used, and the
   classification performance did not reach the standard of practical use.
   We proposed a novel CAD system for MR brain images based on eigenbrains
   and machine learning with two goals: accurate detection of both AD
   subjects and AD-related brain regions.
   Method: First, we used maximum inter-class variance (ICV) to select key
   slices from 3D volumetric data. Second, we generated an eigenbrain set
   for each subject. Third, the most important eigenbrain (MIE) was
   obtained by Welch's t-test (WTT). Finally, kernel
   support-vector-machines with different kernels that were trained by
   particle swarm optimization, were used to make an accurate prediction of
   AD subjects. Coefficients of MIE with values higher than 0.98 quantile
   were highlighted to obtain the discriminant regions that distinguish AD
   from NC.
   Results: The experiments showed that the proposed method can predict AD
   subjects with a competitive performance with existing methods,
   especially the accuracy of the polynomial kernel (92.36 +/- 0.94) was
   better than the linear kernel of 91.47 +/- 1.02 and the radial basis
   function (RBF) kernel of 86.71 +/- 1.93. The proposed eigenbrain-based
   CAD system detected 30 AD-related brain regions (Anterior Cingulate,
   Caudate Nucleus, Cerebellum, Cingulate Gyrus, Claustrum, Inferior
   Frontal Gyrus, Inferior Parietal Lobule, lnsula, Lateral Ventricle,
   Lentiform Nucleus, Lingual Gyrus, Medial Frontal Gyrus, Middle Frontal
   Gyrus, Middle Occipital Gyrus, Middle Temporal Gyrus, Paracentral
   Lobule, Parahippocampal Gyrus, Postcentral Gyrus, Posterial Cingulate,
   Precentral Gyrus, Precuneus, Subcallosal Gyrus, Sub-Gyral, Superior
   Frontal Gyrus, Superior Parietal Lobule, Superior Temporal Gyrus,
   Supramarginal Gyrus, Thalamus, Transverse Temporal Gyrus, and Uncus).
   The results were coherent with existing literatures.
   Conclusion: The eigenbrain method was effective in AD subject prediction
   and discriminant brain-region detection in MRI scanning.}},

Abstract = {{17-Beta-estradiol (E2) facilitates long term-potentiation (LTP) and
   increases spine synapse density in hippocampal neurons of ovariectomized
   rodents. Consistent with these beneficial effects on the cellular level,
   E2 improves hippocampus-dependent memory. A prominent approach to study
   E2 effects in rodents is the inhibition of its synthesis by letrozole,
   which reduces LTPs and spine synapse density. In the current
   longitudinal functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we
   translated this approach to humans and compared the impact of E2
   synthesis inhibition on memory performance and hippocampal activity in
   post-menopausal women taking letrozole (n=21) to controls (n=24). In
   particular, we employed various behavioral memory paradigms that allow
   the disentanglement of hippocampus-dependent and -independent memory.
   Consistent with the literature on rodents, E2 synthesis inhibition
   specifically impaired hippocampus-dependent memory, however, this did
   not apply to the same degree to all of the employed paradigms. On the
   neuronal level, E2 depletion tended to decrease hippocampal activity
   during encoding, whereas it increased activity in the anterior cingulate
   and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. We thus infer that the
   inhibition of E2 synthesis specifically impairs hippocampal functioning
   in humans, whereas the increased prefrontal activity presumably reflects
   a compensatory mechanism, which is already known from studies on
   cognitive aging and Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative
   disorder of the central nervous system. For its early management and
   accurate prognosis, there is a need to develop automated and noninvasive
   computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) technique(s). The present study proposes
   a novel region-of-interest (ROI) based CAD technique using T1-weighted
   magnetic resonance imaging (Mm) to discriminate PD patients from healthy
   subjects. A volumetric 3D T1-weighted (1 mm isovoxel) MRI of 30 PD
   patients and age \& gender matched 30 healthy subjects is acquired on a
   1.5 T MRI scanner. Five well-documented regions affected in PD, namely
   substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, hippocampus, frontal lobe (FL) and
   mid-brain are analyzed individually and in combinations of pairs and
   triplets. Features are constructed from gray matter (GM), white matter
   (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) values of voxel from these regions. A
   small set of discriminating and non-redundant features is selected using
   mutual information based approach in conjunction with unpaired
   two-tailed two-sample t-test based ranking. A decision model is built
   with the help of support vector machine (SVM) as a classifier. The
   performance of the decision model is evaluated in terms. of sensitivity,
   specificity and accuracy with leave-one-out cross-validation scheme.
   Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is able to
   differentiate PD from healthy subjects with a maximum accuracy of
   86.67\% with SN for GM and combination of SN \& FL for WM; and
   outperforms the voxel-based morphometry method. Furthermore, loss in GM
   and WM volume and gain in CSF volume is observed in PD patients in
   comparison to healthy subjects. The excellent performance of the
   proposed method is beneficial for clinicians as it can be used as a
   decision support system which requires less time and efforts in
   diagnosing PD. In addition, it also encourages the application of CAD in
   medical domain. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The hippocampus is a very important structure in memory formation and
   retrieval, as well as in various neurological disorders such as
   Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy and depression. It is composed of many
   intricate subregions making it difficult to study the anatomical changes
   that take place during disease. The hippocampal hilus may have a unique
   neuroanatomy in humans compared to that in monkeys and rodents, with
   field CA3h greatly enlarged in humans compared to that in rodents, and a
   white-matter pathway, called the endfolial pathway, possibly only
   present in humans. In this study we have used newly developed 7.0 T
   whole brain imaging sequence, balanced steady-state free precession
   (bSSFP) that can achieve 0.4 mm isotropic images to study, in vivo, the
   anatomy of the hippocampal hilus. A detailed hippocampal subregional
   segmentation was performed according to anatomic atlases segmenting the
   following regions: CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, SRLM (stratum radiatum lacunosum
   moleculare), alveus, fornix, and subiculum along with its molecular
   layer. We also segmented a hypointense structure centrally within the
   hilus that resembled the endfolial pathway. To validate that this
   hypointense signal represented the endfolial pathway, we acquired 0.1 mm
   isotropic 8-phase cycle bSSFP on an excised specimen, and then sectioned
   and stained the specimen for myelin using an anti-myelin basic protein
   antibody (SMI 94). A structure tensor analysis was calculated on the
   myelin-stained section to show directionality of the underlying fibers.
   The endfolial pathway was consistently visualized within the hippocampal
   body in vivo in all subjects. It is a central pathway in the
   hippocampus, with unknown relevance in neurodegenerative disorders, but
   now that it can be visualized noninvasively, we can study its function
   and alterations in neurodegeneration. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Abstract = {{Introduction: This review aimed to produce hippocampal atrophy rate
   estimates from healthy ageing studies as well as control samples from
   observational studies across the adult lifespan which can be used as
   benchmarks to evaluate abnormal changes in pathological conditions.
   Methods: The review followed PRISMA guidelines. PUBMED (to February
   2014) was searched for longitudinal MRI studies reporting hippocampal
   atrophy or volume change in cognitively healthy individuals. Titles were
   screened and non-English, duplicate or irrelevant entries were excluded.
   Remaining record abstracts were reviewed to identify studies for full
   text retrieval. Full text was retrieved and screened against
   inclusion/exclusion criteria. Bibliographies and previous reviews were
   examined to identify additional studies. Data were summarised using
   meta-analysis and age, segmentation technique and study type were tested
   as potential moderators using meta-regression. It was hypothesised that
   population studies would produce higher atrophy rates than clinical
   observational studies.
   Results: The systematic search identified 4410 entries and 119 studies
   were retrieved with 58 failing selection or quality criteria, 30 were
   excluded as multiple reports and 3 studies were unsuitable for
   meta-analysis. The remaining 28 studies were included in the
   meta-analysis, n = 3422, 44.65\% male, 11,735 person-years of follow-up,
   mean age was 24.50 to 83 years. Mean total hippocampal atrophy for the
   entire sample was 0.85\% per year (95\% CI 0.63, 1.07). Age based
   atrophy rates were 0.38\% per year (CI 0.14, 0.62) for studies with mean
   age <55 years (n = 413), 0.98\% (CI 0.27, 1.70) for 55 to <70 years (n =
   426), and 1.12\% (CI 0.86, 1.38) for >= 70 years (n = 2583).
   Meta-regression indicated age was associated with increased atrophy
   rates of 0.0263\% (CI 0.0146, 0.0379) per year and automated
   segmentation approaches were associated with a reduced atrophy rate of
   -0.466\% (CI -0.841, -0.090). Population studies were not associated
   with a significant effect on atrophy. Analyses of 11 studies separately
   measuring left and right hippocampal atrophy (n = 1142) provided little
   evidence of laterality effects. While no study separately reported
   atrophy by gender, a number tested for gender effects and 2 studies
   reported higher atrophy in males.
   Conclusions: Hippocampal atrophy rates increase with age with the
   largest increases occurring from midlife onwards. Manual segmentation
   approaches result in higher measured atrophy rates. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Title = {{An improved I-FAST system for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease from
   unprocessed electroencephalograms by using robust invariant features}},
Journal = {{ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN MEDICINE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{64}},

Abstract = {{Objective: This paper proposes a new, complex algorithm for the blind
   classification of the original electroencephalogram (EEG) tracing of
   each subject, without any preliminary pre-processing. The medical need
   in this field is to reach an early differential diagnosis between
   subjects affected by mild cognitive impairment (MCI), early Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and the healthy elderly (CTR) using only the recording and
   the analysis of few minutes of their EEG.
   Methods and material: This study analyzed the EEGs of 272 subjects,
   recorded at Rome's Neurology Unit of the Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico.
   The EEG recordings were performed using 19 electrodes, in a 0.3-70 Hz
   bandpass, positioned according to the International 10-20 System. Many
   powerful learning machines and algorithms have been proposed during the
   last 20 years to effectively resolve this complex problem, resulting in
   different and interesting outcomes. Among these algorithms, a new
   artificial adaptive system, named implicit function as squashing time
   (I-FAST), is able to diagnose, with high accuracy, a few minutes of the
   subject's EEG track; whether it manifests an AD, MCI or CTR condition.
   An updating of this system, carried out by adding a new algorithm, named
   multi scale ranked organizing maps (MS-ROM), to the I-FAST system, is
   presented, in order to classify with greater accuracy the unprocessed
   EEG's of AD, MCI and control subjects.
   Results: The proposed system has been measured on three independent
   pattern recognition tasks from unprocessed EEG tracks of a sample of AD
   subjects, MCI subjects and CTR: (a) AD compared with CTR; (b) AD
   compared with MCI; (c) CTR compared with MCI. While the values of
   accuracy of the previous system in distinguishing between AD and MCI
   were around 92\%, the new proposed system reaches values between 94\%
   and 98\%. Similarly, the overall accuracy with best artificial neural
   networks (ANNs) is 98.25\% for the distinguishing between CTR and MCI.
   Conclusions: This new version of I-FAST makes different steps forward:
   (a) avoidance of pre-processing phase and filtering procedure of EEG
   data, being the algorithm able to directly process an unprocessed EEG;
   (b) noise elimination, through the use of a training variant with input
   selection and testing system, based on naive Bayes classifier; (c) a
   more robust classification phase, showing the stability of results on
   nine well known learning machine algorithms; (d) extraction of spatial
   invariants of an EEG signal using, in addition to the unsupervised ANN,
   the principal component analysis and the multi scale entropy, together
   with the MS-ROM; a more accurate performance in this specific task. (C)

Abstract = {{Normal aging is associated with greater decline in associative memory
   relative to item memory due to impaired recollection. Familiarity may
   also contribute to associative recognition when stimuli are perceived as
   a `unitized' representation. Given that familiarity is relatively
   preserved in older adults, we explored whether age-related associative
   memory deficits could be attenuated when associations were unitized
   (i.e., compounds) compared with those non-unitized (i.e., unrelated word
   pairs). Young and older adults performed an associative recognition task
   while electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. Behavioral results showed
   that age differences were smaller for recognition of compounds than for
   unrelated word pairs. ERP results indicated that only compounds evoked
   an early frontal old/new effect in older adults. Moreover, the early
   frontal old/new effect was positively correlated with associative
   discrimination accuracy. These findings suggest that reduced age-related
   associative deficits under unitized condition may be associated with the
   presence of familiarity-based retrieval of compounds in older adults.

Abstract = {{Objective: Past studies have shown that measures of attentional control
   and semantic memory are sensitive markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   The effects of established biomarkers of AD (cerebrospinal fluid tau and
   amyloid-beta42, positron emission tomography Pittsburgh compound-B, and
   apolipoprotein E {[}APOE] genotype) on concurrent cognitive performance
   in cognitively normal individuals have been mixed. The present study
   examined the utility of combining attentional control with semantic
   retrieval as a sensitive correlate of AD biomarkers and used mediation
   analyses to examine possible mechanisms by which the biomarkers
   influence cognition. Method: Three hundred sixty-three participants
   completed a category verification task (CVT), and 113 of them
   concurrently underwent biomarker assessments. On each trial,
   participants viewed a category (e.g., ``unit of time{''}) and verified
   whether a subsequent target item was an exemplar of the category
   ({''}hour{''}) or not ({''}clock{''}). Importantly, the nonmembers of
   the category were associatively related to the category (e.g.,
   ``clock{''} is not `` a unit of time,{''} but is highly related), and
   demanded attentional control to reject. Results: Accuracy to the foil
   items was the strongest discriminator between healthy aging and very
   mild symptomatic AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers had independent yet
   synergistic influence on CVT performance in cognitively healthy older
   adults. Furthermore, the influence of the biomarkers and APOE genotype
   was mediated primarily through increased levels of PIB. Conclusion: The
   combined influence of attentional control with semantic retrieval is a
   marker of symptomatic AD and a sensitive correlate of established
   biomarkers for AD risk in cognitively healthy participants. The
   biomarkers influenced cognition primarily through increased levels of
   amyloid in the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Episodic memory is typically affected during the course of Alzheimer's
   disease (AD). Due to the pronounced heterogeneity of functional
   neuroimaging studies on episodic memory impairments in mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI) and AD regarding their methodology and findings, we
   aimed to delineate consistent episodic memory-related brain activation
   patterns. We performed a systematic, quantitative, coordinate-based
   whole-brain activation likelihood estimation meta-analysis of 28
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies comprising 292 MCI
   and 102 AD patients contrasted to 409 age-matched control subjects. We
   included episodic encoding and/or retrieval phases, investigated the
   effects of group, verbal or image stimuli and correlated mean
   Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores with the modelled
   activation estimates. MCI patients presented increased right hippocampal
   activation during memory encoding, decreased activation in the left
   hippocampus and fusiform gyrus during retrieval tasks, as well as
   attenuated activation in the right anterior insula/inferior frontal
   gyrus during verbal retrieval. In AD patients, however, stronger
   activation within the precuneus during encoding tasks was accompanied by
   attenuated right hippocampal activation during retrieval tasks. Low
   cognitive performance (MMSE scores) was associated with stronger
   activation of the precuneus and reduced activation of the right
   (para)hippocampus and anterior insula/inferior frontal gyrus. This
   meta-analysis provides evidence for a specific and probably disease
   stage-dependent brain activation pattern related to the pathognomonic AD

Title = {{Mutual Information Analysis of Sleep EEG in Detecting

Volume = {{39}},
Number = {{5}},
Month = {{MAY}},
Abstract = {{The primary goal of this study is to state the clear changes in
   functional brain connectivity during all night sleep in
   psycho-physiological insomnia (PPI). The secondary goal is to
   investigate the usefulness of Mutual Information (MI) analysis in
   estimating cortical sleep EEG arousals for detection of PPI. For these
   purposes, healthy controls and patients were compared to each other with
   respect to both linear (Pearson correlation coefficient and coherence)
   and nonlinear quantifiers (MI) in addition to phase locking
   quantification for six sleep stages (stage. 1-4, rem, wake) by means of
   interhemispheric dependency between two central sleep EEG derivations.
   In test, each connectivity estimation calculated for each couple of
   epoches (C3-A2 and C4-A1) was identified by the vector norm of
   estimation. Then, patients and controls were classified by using 10
   different types of data mining classifiers for five error criteria such
   as accuracy, root mean squared error, sensitivity, specificity and
   precision. High performance in a classification through a measure will
   validate high contribution of that measure to detecting PPI. The MI was
   found to be the best method in detecting PPI. In particular, the
   patients had lower MI, higher PCC for all sleep stages. In other words,
   the lower sleep EEG synchronization suffering from PPI was observed.
   These results probably stand for the loss of neurons that then
   contribute to less complex dynamical processing within the neural
   networks in sleep disorders an the functional central brain connectivity
   is nonlinear during night sleep. In conclusion, the level of cortical
   hemispheric connectivity is strongly associated with sleep disorder.
   Thus, cortical communication quantified in all existence sleep stages
   might be a potential marker for sleep disorder induced by PPI.}},

Abstract = {{In the present study, both single channel
   electroencephalography(EEG)complexity and two channel interhemispheric
   dependency measurements have newly been examined for classification of
   patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and controls by using
   support vector machine classifiers. Three embedding entropy measurements
   (approximate entropy, sample entropy, permutation entropy (PermEn)) are
   used to estimate single channel EEG complexity for 19-channel eyes
   closed cortical measurements. Mean coherence and mutual information are
   examined to measure the level of interhemispheric dependency in
   frequency and statistical domain, respectively for eight distinct
   electrode pairs placed on the scalp with respect to the international
   10-20 electrode placement system. All methods are applied to short EEG
   segments of 2 s. The classification performance is measured 20 times
   with different 2-fold cross-validation data for both single channel
   complexity features (19 features) and interhemispheric dependency
   features (eight features). The highest classification accuracy of 85 +/-
   5.2\% is provided by PermEn at prefrontal regions of the brain. Even if
   the classification success do not provided by other methods as high as
   PermEn, the clear differences between patients and controls at
   prefrontal regions can also be obtained by using other methods except
   coherence. In conclusion, OCD, defined as illness of
   orbitofronto-striatal structures {[}Beucke et al., JAMA Psychiatry 70

   caused by functional abnormalities in the pre-frontal regions.
   Particularly, patients are characterized by lower EEG complexity at both
   pre-frontal regions and right fronto-temporal locations. Our results are
   compatible with imaging studies that define OCD as a sub group of
   anxiety disorders exhibited a decreased complexity (such as anorexia

Abstract = {{The accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for

   representing neuroimaging biomarkers. In this study, we designed a novel
   diagnostic framework with deep learning architecture to aid the
   diagnosis of AD. This framework uses a zero-masking strategy for data
   fusion to extract complementary information from multiple data
   modalities. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art workflows, our
   method is capable of fusing multimodal neuroimaging features in one
   setting and has the potential to require less labeled data. A

Journal = {{EJNMMI RESEARCH}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{5}},
Month = {{MAR 28}},
Abstract = {{Background: Over the last decade, an increasing number of studies have
   been published on the use of amyloid-beta (A beta) PET imaging with
   different F-18-radiopharmaceuticals for clinical characterization of
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) in different stages. However, distinct study
   cohorts and different quantification techniques allow only for an
   indirect comparison between the different tracers. Thus, the aim of this
   study was the direct intra-individual in vivo comparison of different A
   beta-targeted radiopharmaceuticals for PET imaging, including the newly
   developed agent {[}F-18]FIBT.
   Methods: A small group of four animals of a well-characterized APP/PS1
   transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD and gender-matched control (ctl)
   animals underwent a sequential and standardized PET imaging regimen for
   direct comparison of {[}F-18]FIBT, {[}F-18]florbetaben, and {[}C-11]PiB.
   The quantitative PET imaging data were cross-validated with the cerebral
   A beta plaque load as quantified ex vivo on histological sections.
   Results: We found that FIBT (2-(p-methylaminophenyl)-7-(2-{[}F-18]
   fluoroethoxy) imidazo{[}2,1-b]benzothiazole) compares favorably to
   florbetaben as a high-contrasting PET radiopharmaceutical for imaging A
   beta pathology. The excellent pharmacokinetics of FIBT in combination
   with its high-binding affinity towards A beta resulted in feasible
   high-contrast imaging of A beta with high global cortex to cerebellum
   standard uptake value ratio (SUVR) in 24-month-old tg mice (tg 1.68 +/-
   0.15 vs. ctl 0.95 +/- 0.02). The SUVRs in transgenic versus control
   animals (SUVRtg/SUVRctl) for FIBT (1.78 +/- 0.16) were similar to the
   ratios as observed in humans (SUVRAD/SUVRctl) for the established gold
   standard Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) (1.65 +/- 0.41).
   Conclusions: This head-to-head PET tracer comparison study in mice
   indicated the good imaging properties of {[}F-18]FIBT, such as high
   initial brain uptake, fast clearance of the brain, and high binding
   affinity towards A beta as directly compared to the established amyloid
   tracers. Moreover, the preclinical study design is recommendable for
   reliable assessment and comparison of novel radiopharmaceuticals.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN AGING NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{7}},
Month = {{MAR 20}},
Abstract = {{Background: Temporo-parietal and medial temporal cortex atrophy are
   associated with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer disease
   (AD) as well as the reduction of regional cerebral blood perfusion in
   hippocampus. Moreover, the increase of EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio has
   been associated with MCI due to AD and with an increase in theta
   frequency power in a group of subjects with impaired cerebral perfusion
   in hippocampus.
   Methods: Seventy four adult subjects with MCI underwent clinical and
   neuropsychological evaluation, electroencephalogram (EEG) recording and
   high resolution 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Among the patients,
   a subset of 27 subjects underwent also perfusion single-photon emission
   computed tomography and hippocampal atrophy evaluation. Alpha3/alpha2
   power ratio as well as cortical thickness was computed for each subject.
   Three MCI groups were detected according to increasing tertile values of
   alpha3/alpha2 power ratio and difference of cortical thickness among the
   groups estimated.
   Results: Higher alpha3/alpha2 power ratio group had wider cortical
   thinning than other groups, mapped to the Supramarginal and Precuneus
   bilaterally. Subjects with higher alpha3/alpha2 frequency power ratio
   showed a constant trend to a lower perfusion than lower alpha3/alpha2
   group. Moreover, this group correlates with both a bigger hippocampal
   atrophy and an increase of theta frequency power.
   Conclusion: Higher EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio was associated with
   temporoparietal cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and reduction of
   regional cerebral perfusion in medial temporal cortex. In this group an
   increase of theta frequency power was detected inMCI subjects. The
   combination of higher EEG alpha3/alpha2 power ratio, cortical thickness
   measure and regional cerebral perfusion reveals a complex interplay
   between EEG cerebral rhythms, structural and functional brain
   modifications.}},

Abstract = {{We studied the influence of emotions on autobiographical memory (AbM) in
   patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), characteristically triggering
   atrophy in the hippocampus and the amygdala, two crucial structures
   sustaining memory and emotional processing. Our first aim was to analyze
   the influence of emotion on AbM in AD patients, on both the proportion
   and the specificity of emotional memories. Additionally, we sought to
   determine the relationship of emotional AbM to amygdalar-hippocampal
   volumes. Eighteen prodromal to mild AD patients and 18 age matched
   healthy controls were included. We obtained 30 autobiographical memories
   per participant using the modified Crovitz test (MCT). Analyses were
   performed on global scores, rates and specificity scores of the
   emotional vs. neutral categories of memories. Amygdalar-hippocampal
   volumes were extracted from 3D T1-weighted MRI scans and tested for
   correlations with behavioral data. Overall, AD patients displayed a
   deficit in emotional AbMs as they elicited less emotional memories than
   the controls, however, the specificity of those memories was preserved.
   The deficit likely implied retrieval or storage as it was extended in
   time and without reminiscence bump effect. Global scores and rates of
   emotional memories, but not the specificity scores, were correlated to
   right amygdalar and hippocampal volumes, indicating that atrophy in
   these structures has a central role in the deficit observed. Conversely,
   emotional memories were more specific than neutral memories in both
   groups, reflecting an enhancement effect of emotion that could be
   supported by other brain regions that are spared during the early stages
   of the disease.}},

Abstract = {{Although many epidemiological studies suggest the beneficial effects of

   and dementia risk, the neural basis of CR is poorly understood. To our
   knowledge, the present study represents the first electrophysiological
   investigation of the relationship between CR and neural reserve (i.e.,
   neural efficiency and capacity). Specifically, we examined whether CR
   modulates event-related potentials associated with performance on a
   verbal recognition memory task with 3 set sizes (1, 4, or 7 letters) in
   healthy younger and older adults. Neural data showed that as task
   difficulty increased, the amplitude of the parietal P3b component during
   the probe phase decreased and its latency increased. Notably, the degree
   of these neural changes was negatively correlated with CR in both age
   groups, such that individuals with higher CR showed smaller changes in
   P3b amplitude and less slowing in P3b latency (i.e., smaller changes in
   the speed of neural processing) with increasing task difficulty,
   suggesting greater neural efficiency. These CR-related differences in
   neural efficiency may underlie reserve against neuropathology and
   age-related burden. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) is one of the main symptoms of
   several sleep related disorders with a great impact on the patient
   lives. While many studies have been carried out in order to assess
   daytime sleepiness, the automatic EDS detection still remains an open
   problem. In this work, a novel approach to this issue based on
   non-linear dynamical analysis of EEG signal was proposed. Multichannel
   EEG signals were recorded during five maintenance of wakefulness (MWT)
   and multiple sleep latency (MSLT) tests alternated throughout the day
   from patients suffering from sleep disordered breathing. A group of 20
   patients with excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) was compared with a
   group of 20 patients without daytime sleepiness (WDS), by analyzing 60-s
   EEG windows in waking state. Measures obtained from cross-mutual
   information function (CMIF) and auto-mutual-information function (AMIF)
   were calculated in the EEG. These functions permitted a quantification
   of the complexity properties of the EEG signal and the non-linear
   couplings between different zones of the scalp. Statistical differences
   between EDS and WDS groups were found in beta band during MSLT events
   (p-value <0.0001). WDS group presented more complexity than EDS in the
   occipital zone, while a stronger nonlinear coupling between occipital
   and frontal zones was detected in EDS patients than in WDS. The AMIF and
   CMIF measures yielded sensitivity and specificity above 80\% and AUC of
   ROC above 0.85 in classifying EDS and WDS patients. (C) 2015 IPEM.

Abstract = {{Familiarity and recollection are two independent cognitive processes
   involved in recognition memory. It is traditionally believed that both
   familiarity and recollection can support item recognition, whereas only
   recollection can support associative recognition. Here, using a standard
   associative recognition task, we examined whether associative retrieval
   of unitized associations involved differential patterns of familiarity
   and recollection processes relative to non-unitized associations. The
   extent of engagement of familiarity and recollection processes during
   associative retrieval was estimated by using event-related potentials
   (ERPs). Twenty participants studied compound words and unrelated word
   pairs during encoding. Subsequently, they were asked to decide whether a
   presented word pair was intact rearranged, or a new pair while
   electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded. ERP results showed that
   compound words evoked a significant early frontal old/new effect
   (associated with familiarity) between ERPs to intact and rearranged word
   pairs, whereas this effect disappeared for the unrelated word pairs. In
   addition, the left parietal old/new effect (associated with
   recollection) between ERPs to intact and rearranged word pairs was
   greater for compounds than for unrelated word pairs. These findings
   suggest that unitization enhances the contribution of both familiarity
   and recollection processes to associative recognition. (C) 2015 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Recently, there have been great interests for computer-aided diagnosis
   of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive
   impairment (MCI). Unlike the previous methods that considered simple
   low-level features such as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI, and mean
   signal intensities from PET, in this paper, we propose a deep
   learning-based latent feature representation with a stacked auto-encoder
   (SAE). We believe that there exist latent non-linear complicated
   patterns inherent in the low-level features such as relations among
   features. Combining the latent information with the original features
   helps build a robust model in AD/MCI classification, with high
   diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, thanks to the unsupervised
   characteristic of the pre-training in deep learning, we can benefit from
   the target-unrelated samples to initialize parameters of SAE, thus
   finding optimal parameters in fine-tuning with the target-related
   samples, and further enhancing the classification performances across
   four binary classification problems: AD vs. healthy normal control (HC),
   MCI vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI converter (MCI-C) vs. MCI non-converter
   (MCI-NC). In our experiments on ADNI dataset, we validated the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, showing the accuracies of 98.8,
   90.7, 83.7, and 83.3 \% for AD/HC, MCI/HC, AD/MCI, and MCI-C/MCI-NC
   classification, respectively. We believe that deep learning can shed new
   light on the neuroimaging data analysis, and our work presented the
   applicability of this method to brain disease diagnosis.}},

Abstract = {{Automatic seizure detection is of great significance in the monitoring
   and diagnosis of epilepsy. In this study, a novel method is proposed for
   automatic seizure detection in intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG)
   recordings based on kernel collaborative representation (KCR). Firstly,
   the EEG recordings are divided into 4s epochs, and then wavelet
   decomposition with five scales is performed. After that, detail signals
   at scales 3, 4 and 5 are selected to be sparsely coded over the training
   sets using KCR. In KCR, l(2)-minimization replaces l(1)-minimization and
   the sparse coefficients are computed with regularized least square
   (RLS), and a kernel function is utilized to improve the separability
   between seizure and nonseizure signals. The reconstructed residuals of
   each EEG epoch associated with seizure and nonseizure training samples
   are compared and EEG epochs are categorized as the class that minimizes
   the reconstructed residual. At last, a multi-decision rule is applied to
   obtain the final detection decision. In total, 595 h of iEEG recordings
   from 21 patients with 87 seizures are employed to evaluate the system.
   The average sensitivity of 94.41\%, specificity of 96.97\%, and false
   detection rate of 0.26/h are achieved. The seizure detection system
   based on KCR yields both a high sensitivity and a low false detection
   rate for long-term EEG.}},

Abstract = {{Objectives: Creativity, which presumably involves various connections
   within and across different neural networks, reportedly underpins the
   mental well-being of older adults. Multiscale entropy (MSE) can
   characterize the complexity inherent in EEG dynamics with multiple
   temporal scales. It can therefore provide useful insight into neural
   networks. Given that background, we sought to clarify the
   neurophysiological bases of creativity in healthy elderly subjects by
   assessing EEG complexity with MSE, with emphasis on assessment of neural
   networks.
   Methods: We recorded resting state EEG of 20 healthy elderly subjects.
   MSE was calculated for each subject for continuous 20-s epochs. Their
   relevance to individual creativity was examined concurrently with
   intellectual function.
   Results: Higher individual creativity was linked closely to increased
   EEG complexity across higher temporal scales, but no significant
   relation was found with intellectual function ( IQ score).
   Conclusions: Considering the general ``loss of complexity'' theory of
   aging, our finding of increased EEG complexity in elderly people with
   heightened creativity supports the idea that creativity is associated
   with activated neural networks. Significance: Results reported here
   underscore the potential usefulness of MSE analysis for characterizing
   the neurophysiological bases of elderly people with heightened

Abstract = {{Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are heterogeneous neurodevelopmental
   disorders that are reportedly characterized by aberrant neural networks.
   Recently developed multiscale entropy analysis (MSE) can characterize
   the complexity inherent in electroencephalography (EEG) dynamics over
   multiple temporal scales in the dynamics of neural networks. We
   encountered an 18-year-old man with ASD whose refractory catatonic
   obsessive-compulsive symptoms were improved dramatically after
   electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). In this clinical case study, we strove
   to clarify the neurophysiological mechanism of ECT in ASD by assessing
   EEG complexity using MSE. Along with ECT, the frontocentral region
   showed decreased EEG complexity at higher temporal scales, whereas the
   occipital region expressed an increase at lower temporal scales.
   Furthermore, these changes were associated with clinical improvement
   associated with the elevation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor,
   which is a molecular hypothesis of ECT, playing key roles in ASD
   pathogenesis. Changes in EEG complexity in a region-specific and
   temporal scale-specific manner that we found might reflect atypical EEG
   dynamics in ASD. Although MSE is not a direct approach to measuring
   neural connectivity and the results are from only a single case, they
   might reflect specific aberrant neural network activity and the
   therapeutic neurophysiological mechanism of ECT in ASD.}},

Abstract = {{Whereas traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in widespread disruption of
   neural networks, changes in regional resting-state functional
   connectivity patterns after insult remain unclear. Specifically, little
   is known about the chronology of emergent connectivity alterations and
   whether they persist after a critical recovery window. We used
   resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed-voxel
   correlational analyses in both cross-sectional and longitudinal designs
   to probe intrinsic connectivity patterns involving the posterior
   cingulate cortex (PCC) and hippocampi, regions shown to be important in
   the default mode network (DMN) and vulnerable to neuropathology. A total
   of 22 participants in the chronic stage of moderate-to-severe TBI and 18
   healthy controls were included for cross-sectional study. Longitudinal
   analyses included 13 individuals in the TBI group for whom data
   approximately 3 months after injury (subacute) were available. Overall,
   results indicated dissociable connectivity trajectories of the PCC and
   hippocampi during recovery from TBI, with PCC alterations characterized
   by early hypersynchrony with the anterior DMN that is gradually reduced,
   and hippocampal changes marked by increasing synchrony with proximal
   cortex and subcortex. The PCC also showed increasing antiphase synchrony
   with posterior attentional regions, and the hippocampi showed decreasing
   antiphase synchrony with frontal attentional regions. Antiphase
   synchrony of the hippocampus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the
   subacute stage of TBI was positively associated with attentional
   performance on neuropsychological tests at both the subacute and chronic
   stages. Our findings highlight the heterogeneity of regional whole-brain
   connectivity changes after TBI, and suggest that residual connectivity
   alterations exist in the clinically stable phase of TBI. Parallels
   between the chronicity of the observed effects and findings in
   neurodegenerative disease are discussed in the context of potential
   long-term outcomes of TBI.}},

Abstract = {{The paper offers a new methodology for modelling, recognition and

   element is that mental tasks are performed through complex

   if we model property the spatio-/spectro temporal data that measures
   these processes. The proposed methodology is based on a recently
   proposed novel spiking neural network architecture, called NeuCube as a
   general framework for spatio-temporal brain data modelling. The
   methodology is demonstrated on benchmark cognitive EEG data. The new
   approach leads to a faster data processing, improved accuracy of the EEG
   data classification and improved understanding of this data and the
   cognitive processes that generated it. The paper concluded that the new
   methodology is worth exploring further on other spatio-temporal data,
   measuring complex cognitive brain processes, aiming at using this method
   for the development of the next generation of brain-computer interfaces

Abstract = {{In this study, we wished to examine the relationship between the
   structural connectivity of the fornix, a white matter (WM) tract in the
   limbic system, which is affected in amnestic mild cognitive impairment
   (aMCI) and Alzheimers disease, and the resting-state functional
   connectivity (FC) of two key related subcortical structures, the
   thalamus, and hippocampus. Twenty-two older healthy controls (HC) and 18
   older adults with aMCI underwent multi-modal MRI scanning. The fornix
   was reconstructed using constrained-spherical deconvolution-based
   tractography. The FC between the thalamus and hippocampus was calculated
   using a region-of-interest approach from which the mean time series were
   exacted and correlated. Diffusion tensor imaging measures of the WM
   microstructure of the fornix were correlated against the Fisher Z
   correlation values from the FC analysis. There was no difference between
   the groups in the fornix WM measures, nor in the resting-state FC of the
   thalamus and hippocampus. We did however find that the relationship
   between functional and structural connectivity differed significantly
   between the groups. In the HCs, there was a significant positive
   association between linear diffusion (CL) in the fornix and the FC of
   the thalamus and hippocampus, however, there was no relationship between
   these measures in the aMCI group. These preliminary findings suggest
   that in aMCI, the relationship between the functional and structural
   connectivity of regions of the limbic system may be significantly
   altered compared to healthy ageing. The combined use of diffusion
   weighted imaging and functional MRI may advance our understanding of
   neural network changes in aMCI, and elucidate subtle changes in the

Abstract = {{Neuropathology suggests an important role for the locus coeruleus (LC)
   in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Neuropathology and
   structural damage in the LC appears to be one of the earliest changes.
   We hypothesize that reduced functional integration of the LC reflected
   by lower brain functional connectivity contributes to early memory
   dysfunction. To test this, we examined resting-state functional
   connectivity from the LC in 18 healthy older individuals and 18 mildly
   cognitively impaired patients with possible AD. Connectivity measures
   were correlated with memory scores. The left LC showed strong
   connectivity to the left parahippocampal gyrus that correlated with
   memory performance in healthy persons. This connectivity was reduced in
   aMCI patients. Lateralization of connectivity-memory correlations was
   altered in less impaired aMCI patients: greater right LC-left
   parahippocampal gyrus connectivity was associated with better memory
   performance, in particular for encoding. Our results provide new
   evidence that the LC, in interaction with the parahippocampal gyrus, may
   contribute to episodic memory formation. They suggest functional
   impairment and the possibility that associated compensatory changes
   contribute to preserved memory functions in early AD. Structural and
   functional LC-related measures may provide early AD markers. (C) 2015

Abstract = {{Concept formation is the ability to create an abstract link between
   dissimilar objects or thoughts and is crucial for abstract and creative
   thinking. This process is related to the integrity of the prefrontal
   cortex, given the altered performances reported in patients with frontal
   damage, particularly those suffering from the behavioural variant of
   frontotemporal dementia. However, the cognitive mechanisms and neural
   bases of verbal concept formation are not clearly understood. The
   present study was aimed at addressing the following unresolved issues
   regarding concept formation in the field of neurology and cognitive
   neuroscience: (i) Are alterations in concept formation specific to
   frontotemporal dementia or are they also present in other cortical
   neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease? (ii) Is
   impaired performance in concept formation due to cortical lesions
   specific to frontotemporal dementia or to a cortico-subcortical frontal
   syndrome? and (iii) What are the cognitive mechanisms and neural bases
   underlying concept formation? To address these questions, we designed
   the Verbal Concept Formation Task, an experimental paradigm based on the
   similarities test. Patients presenting with severe frontal dysfunction
   (frontotemporal dementia, n = 18, and the Richardson form of progressive
   supranuclear palsy, n = 21) or with medial temporal pathology (amnestic
   mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, n = 14) and healthy
   participants (n = 18) were given the Verbal Concept Formation Task and a
   large battery of neuropsychological tests. In addition, all participants
   underwent 3D T1-weighted MRI to analyse grey matter volume using
   voxel-based morphometry. Frontal patients were significantly impaired on
   the Verbal Concept Formation Task as compared to non-frontal
   participants (P = 0.00001). Global performance score was positively
   correlated with scores in cognitive tasks assessing executive functions
   and with grey matter volume in several areas, mostly in the
   frontal-basal-ganglion network. Two types of errors were observed in
   frontal patients. The most frequent was discriminating instead of
   grouping items ('linking deficit'). Patients also linked items on a
   concrete instead of an abstract basis ('abstraction deficit'). Linking
   and abstraction deficits were related to partially different areas: the
   linking deficit to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right middle
   frontal gyrus and both inferior parietal lobules and the abstraction
   deficit to the head of the caudate nuclei and the left superior frontal
   gyrus. These data suggest that verbal concept formation requires the
   integrity of the prefrontal-basal-ganglion functional network. In
   addition, it can be divided into two distinct cognitive processes, which
   are underlain by two partially different neural networks.}},

Abstract = {{Semantic cognition is underpinned by regions involved in representing
   conceptual knowledge and executive control areas that provide regulation
   of this information according to current task requirements. Using
   distortion-corrected fMRI, we investigated the contributions of these
   two systems to abstract and concrete word comprehension. We contrasted
   semantic decisions made either with coherent contextual support, which
   encouraged retrieval of a rich conceptual representation, or with
   irrelevant contextual information, which instead maximised demands on
   control processes. Inferior prefrontal cortex was activated more when
   decisions were made in the presence of irrelevant context, suggesting
   that this region is crucial for the semantic control functions required
   to select appropriate aspects of meaning in the face of competing
   information. It also exhibited greater activation for abstract words,
   which reflects the fact that abstract words tend to have variable,
   context-dependent meanings that place higher demands on control
   processes. In contrast, anterior temporal regions (ATL) were most active
   when decisions were made with the benefit of a coherent context,
   suggesting a representational role. There was a graded shift in
   concreteness effects in this region, with dorsolateral areas
   particularly active for abstract words and ventromedial areas
   preferentially activated by concrete words. This supports the idea that
   concrete concepts are closely associated with visual experience and
   abstract concepts with auditory-verbal information; and that sub-regions
   of the ATL display graded specialisation for these two types of
   knowledge. Between these two extremes, we identified significant
   activations for both word types in ventrolateral ATL. This area is known
   to be involved in representing knowledge for concrete concepts; here we
   established that it is also activated by abstract concepts. These
   results converge with data from rTMS and neuropsychological
   investigations in demonstrating that representational content and task
   demands influence recruitment of different areas in the semantic

Abstract = {{Electroencephalography (EEG) is a powerful method of studying the
   electrophysiology of the brain with high temporal resolution. Several
   analytical approaches to extract information from the EEG signal have
   been proposed. One method, termed microstate analysis, considers the
   multichannel EEG recording as a series of quasi-stable ``microstates{''}
   that are each characterized by a unique topography of electric
   potentials over the entire channel array. Because this technique
   simultaneously considers signals recorded from all areas of the cortex,
   it is capable of assessing the function of large-scale brain networks
   whose disruption is associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders.
   In this review, we first introduce the method of EEG microstate
   analysis. We then review studies that have discovered significant
   changes in the resting-state microstate series in a variety of
   neuropsychiatric disorders and behavioral states. We discuss the
   potential utility of this method in detecting neurophysiological
   impairments in disease and monitoring neurophysiological changes in
   response to an intervention. Finally, we discuss how the resting-state
   microstate series may reflect rapid switching among neural networks
   while the brain is at rest, which could represent activity of
   resting-state networks described by other neuroimaging modalities. We
   conclude by commenting on the current and future status of microstate
   analysis, and suggest that EEG microstates represent a promising
   neurophysiological tool for understanding and assessing brain network
   dynamics on a millisecond timescale in health and disease. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{Indexing and classification tools for Content Based Visual Information
   Retrieval (CBVIR) have been penetrating the universe of medical image
   analysis. They have been recently investigated for Alzheimer's disease
   (AD) diagnosis. This is a normal ``knowledge diffusion{''} process, when
   methodologies developed for multimedia mining penetrate a new
   application area. The latter brings its own specificities requiring an
   adjustment of methodologies on the basis of domain knowledge. In this
   paper, we develop an automatic classification framework for AD
   recognition in structural Magnetic Resonance Images (MRI). The main
   contribution of this work consists in considering visual features from
   the most involved region in AD (hippocampal area) and in using a late
   fusion to increase precision results. Our approach has been first
   evaluated on the baseline MR images of 218 subjects from the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database and then tested on a 3T
   weighted contrast MRI obtained from a subsample of a large French
   epidemiological study: ``Bordeaux dataset{''}. The experimental results
   show that our classification of patients with AD versus NC (Normal
   Control) subjects achieves the accuracies of 87 \% and 85 \% for ADNI
   subset and ``Bordeaux dataset{''} respectively. For the most challenging
   group of subjects with the Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), we reach
   accuracies of 78.22 \% and 72.23 \% for MCI versus NC and MCI versus AD
   respectively on ADNI. The late fusion scheme improves classification
   results by 9 \% in average for these three categories. Results
   demonstrate very promising classification performance and simplicity
   compared to the state-of-the-art volumetric AD diagnosis methods.}},

Abstract = {{Self-referential processing relies mainly on the medial prefrontal
   cortex (MPFC) and enhances memory encoding (i.e., Self Reference Effect,
   SRE) as it improves the accuracy and richness of remembering in both
   young and older adults. However, studies on age-related changes in the
   neural correlates of the SRE on the subjective (i.e., autonoetic
   consciousness) and the objective (i.e., source memory) qualitative
   features of episodic memory are lacking. In the present fMRI study, we
   compared the effects of a self related (semantic autobiographical memory
   task) and a non self-related (general semantic memory task) encoding
   condition on subsequent episodic memory retrieval. We investigated
   encoding-related activity during each condition in two groups of 19
   younger and 16 older adults. Behaviorally, the SRE improved subjective
   memory performance in both groups but objective memory only in young
   adults. At the neural level, a direct comparison between self-related
   and non self-related conditions revealed that SRE mainly activated the
   cortical midline system, especially the MPFC, in both groups.
   Additionally, in older adults and regardless of the condition, greater
   activity was found in a fronto-parietal network. Overall, correlations
   were noted between source memory performance and activity in the MPFC
   (irrespective of age) and visual areas (mediated by age). Thus, the
   present findings expand evidence of the role of the MPFC in
   self-referential processing in the context of source memory benefit in
   both young and older adults using incidental encoding via semantic
   autobiographical memory. However, our finding suggests that its role is
   less effective in aging.}},

Abstract = {{Memory encoding and retrieval problems are inherent to aging. To date,
   however, the effect of aging upon the neural correlates of forming

Abstract = {{Unsupervised learning approaches, such as Sparse Partial Least Squares
   (SPLS), may provide useful insights into the brain mechanisms by finding
   relationships between two sets of variables (i.e. views) from the same

   each pair expresses an ``effect{''} between both views. However, each

   voxels/regions which provides an unique solution with different levels
   of sparsity per weight vector pair. The effects described by the weight
   vector pairs are ranked by how much data covariance they explain. The
   proposed method was able to find statistically significant effects or
   relationships in a dementia dataset between clinical/demographic
   information and brain scans. Its adaptive nature allowed not only to
   determine an optimal sparse solution, but also provided the flexibility

   The reasoning behind this process is difficult to document and share,
   which is a major obstacle in adopting evidence-based medicine in
   radiology. We report our attempt to use a comprehensive brain
   parcellation tool to systematically capture image features and use them
   to record, search, and evaluate anatomical phenotypes. Anatomical images
   (T1-weighted MRI) were converted to a standardized index by using a
   high-dimensional image transformation method followed by atlas-based
   parcellation of the entire brain. We investigated how the indexed
   anatomical data captured the anatomical features of healthy controls and
   a population with Primary Progressive Aphasia (PPA). PPA was chosen
   because patients have apparent atrophy at different degrees and
   locations, thus the automated quantitative results can be compared with
   trained clinicians3 qualitative evaluations. We explored and tested the
   power of individual classifications and of performing a search for
   images with similar anatomical features in a database using partial
   least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and principal component
   analysis (PCA). The agreement between the automated z-score and the
   averaged visual scores for atrophy (r = 0.8) was virtually the same as
   the inter-evaluator agreement. The PCA plot distribution correlated with
   the anatomical phenotypes and the PLS-DA resulted in a model with an
   accuracy of 88\% for distinguishing PPA variants. The quantitative
   indices captured the main anatomical features. The indexing of image
   data has a potential to be an effective, comprehensive, and easily
   translatable tool for clinical practice, providing new opportunities to

Abstract = {{Deficits in autobiographical memory appear earlier for recent than for
   remote life periods over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
   present study aims to further our understanding of this graded effect by
   investigating the cognitive and neural substrates of recent versus
   remote autobiographical memories in patients with amnestic Mild
   Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) thanks to an autobiographical fluency task.
   20 aMCI patients and 25 Healthy elderly Controls (HC) underwent
   neuropsychological tests assessing remote (20-to-30 years old) and
   recent (the ten last years) autobiographical memory as well as episodic
   and semantic memory, executive function and global cognition. All
   patients also had a structural MRI and an FDG-PET scan. Correlations
   were assessed between each autobiographical memory score and the other
   tests as well as grey matter volume and metabolism. Within the aMCI,
   performances for the remote period correlated with personal semantic
   memory and episodic memory retrieval whereas performances for the recent
   period only correlated with episodic memory retrieval. Neuroimaging
   analyses revealed significant correlations between performances for the
   remote period and temporal pole and temporo-parietal cortex volumes and
   anterior cingulate gyrus metabolism, while performances for the recent
   period correlated with hippocampal volume and posterior cingulate,
   medial prefrontal and hippocampus metabolism. The brain regions related
   with the retrieval of events from the recent period showed greater
   atrophy/hypometabolism in aMCI patients compared to HC than those
   involved in remote memories. Recall of recent memories essentially
   relies on episodic memory processes and brain network while remote
   memories also involve other processes such as semantic memory. This is
   consistent with the semanticization of memories with time and may
   explain the better resistance of remote memory in AD. (C) 2015 The

Abstract = {{High spatial and temporal resolution measurements of neuronal activity
   are preferably combined. In an overview on how this approach can take
   shape, multimodal electroencephalography (EEG) is treated in 2 main
   parts: by experiments without a task and in the experimentally cued
   working brain. It concentrates first on the alpha rhythm properties and
   next on data-driven search for patterns such as the default mode
   network. The high-resolution volumic distributions of neuronal metabolic
   indices result in distributed cortical regions and possibly relate to
   numerous nuclei, observable in a non-invasive manner in the central
   nervous system of humans. The second part deals with paradigms in which
   nowadays assessment of target-related networks can align level-dependent
   blood oxygenation, electrical responses and behaviour, taking the
   temporal resolution advantages of event-related potentials.
   Evidence-based electrical propagation in serial tasks during performance
   is now to a large extent attributed to interconnected pathways,

   dorsal stream, next ventral cortical areas taking the flow of

   Disease (AD) on the bases of structural MRI measures. The main goal of
   the strategy used in this paper is to improve the retrieval performance
   while using smaller number of features. The feature vector consists of
   the measurements of cortical and subcortical brain structures, including
   volumes of the brain structures and cortical thickness. The feature
   subset selection is additionally applied using the Correlation-based
   Feature Selection method to exclude irrelevant, redundant or possibly
   noisy data and to consider the most relevant and discriminative
   features. Six different scenarios for the image representation are
   studied: volumetric features, cortical thickness features, all imaging
   features, selected volumetric features, selected cortical thickness
   feature and selected imaging features. Euclidean distance is used as a
   similarity measurement. The dataset used for evaluation of the retrieval
   performance is provided by the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI). Experimental results show that the strategy used in
   this research outperforms the traditional one despite its simplicity and
   small number of features used for representation. Additionally, the
   performed analysis demonstrated that the selected features are highly
   stable through the leave-one-out strategy. Moreover, they are stressed
   in the literature as significant biomarkers for Alzheimer's Disease,

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder
   that can lead to progressive memory loss and cognition impairment.
   Therefore, diagnosing AD during the risk stage, a.k.a. Mild Cognitive
   Impairment (MCI), has attracted ever increasing interest. Besides the
   automated diagnosis of MCI, it is important to provide physicians with
   related MCI cases with visually similar imaging data for case-based
   reasoning or evidence-based medicine in clinical practices. To this end,
   we propose a multi-graph learning based medical image retrieval
   technique for MCI diagnostic assistance. Our method is comprised of two
   stages, the query category prediction and ranking. In the first stage,
   the query is formulated into a multi-graph structure with a set of
   selected subjects in the database to learn the relevance between the
   query subject and the existing subject categories through learning the
   multi-graph combination weights. This predicts the category that the
   query belongs to, based on which a set of subjects in the database are
   selected as candidate retrieval results. In the second stage, the
   relationship between these candidates and the query is further learned
   with a new multi-graph, which is used to rank the candidates. The
   returned subjects can be demonstrated to physicians as reference cases
   for MCI diagnosing. We evaluated the proposed method on a cohort of 60
   consecutive MCI subjects and 350 normal controls with MRI data under
   three imaging parameters: T1 weighted imaging (T1), Diffusion Tensor
   Imaging (DTI) and Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL). The proposed method can
   achieve average 3.45 relevant samples in top 5 returned results, which
   significantly outperforms the baseline methods compared.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia,
   is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with interrelated molecular,
   physiological, anatomical, biomarker, and cognitive dimensions. Methods:
   This article reviews the biological changes (genetic, molecular, and
   cellular) underlying AD and their correlation with the clinical
   syndrome. Results: Dementia associated with AD is related to the
   aberrant production, processing, and clearance of beta-amyloid and tau.
   Beta-amyloid deposition in brain follows a distinct spatial progression
   starting in the basal neocortex, spreading throughout the hippocampus,
   and eventually spreading to the rest of the cortex. The spread of tau
   pathology through neural networks leads to a distinct and consistent
   spatial progression of neurofibrillary tangles, beginning in the
   transentorhinal and hippocampal region and spreading superolaterally to
   the primary areas of the neocortex. Synaptic dysfunction and cell death
   is shown by progressive loss of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and
   progressive brain atrophy. Decreases in synapse number in the dentate
   gyrus of the hippocampus correlate with declining cognitive function.
   Amyloid changes are detectable in cerebrospinal fluid and with amyloid
   imaging up to 20 years prior to the onset of symptoms. Structural
   atrophy may be detectable via magnetic resonance imaging up to 10 years
   before clinical signs appear. Conclusion: This review highlights the
   progression of biological changes underlying AD and their association
   with the clinical syndrome. Many changes occur before overt symptoms are
   evident and biomarkers provide a means to detect AD pathology even in
   patients without symptoms.}},

Title = {{Brain tissue segmentation using fuzzy clustering techniques}},
Journal = {{TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE}},
Year = {{2015}},
Volume = {{23}},
Number = {{5}},
Pages = {{571-580}},
Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Medical image segmentation is an essential step for most
   consequent image analysis tasks. Medical images can be segmented
   manually, but the accuracy of image segmentation using the automated
   segmentation algorithms is more when compared with the manual
   calculations. In this paper, an automated segmentation and
   classification of tissues are proposed for MR brain images.
   OBJECTIVE: To classify MR brain image into three segments such as Grey
   Matter (GM), White Matter (WM) and Cerebro-Spinal Fluid (CSF).
   Classification of brain into tissues helps to diagnose several diseases
   such as tumors, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis.
   METHODS: An unsupervised clustering technique such as Fuzzy C-Means
   (FCM) algorithm has been widely used in segmenting the images. The
   spatial information is not fully utilized by the conventional clustering
   algorithm and hence it is not applicable for clustering a noisy image.
   We incorporate a method for image clustering called out as Reformulated
   Fuzzy Local information C-Means Clustering algorithm {[}RFLICM] which is
   a variant of traditional Clustering algorithm by considering both
   spatial and gray level information. In RFLICM, spatial distance is
   replaced by local coefficient of variation in a fuzzy manner.
   RESULTS: Experiments are conducted on brain images to validate the
   performance of the proposed technique in segmenting the medical images
   and the efficiency achieved in the presence of salt and pepper noise is
   99.86\%.
   CONCLUSION: Standard FCM, Fuzzy Local information C-means clustering
   algorithm {[}FLICM], Reformulated Fuzzy Local information C-means
   clustering algorithm {[}RFLICM] are compared to explore the accuracy of
   our proposed approach. Clustering results show that RFLICM segmentation
   method is appropriate for classifying tissues in brain MR image.}},

Abstract = {{EEG (electroencephalogram) has a lot of advantages compared to other
   methods in the analysis of Alzheimer's disease such as diagnosing
   Alzheimer's disease in an early stage. Traditional EEG analysis method
   needs a lot of artificial works such as calculating coherence between
   different pair of electrodes. In our work we applied deep learning
   network in the analysis of EEG data of Alzheimer's disease to fully use
   the advantage of the unsupervised feature learning. We studied EEG based
   deep learning on 15 clinically diagnosed Alzheimer's disease patients
   and 15 healthy people. Each person has 16 electrodes. The time domain
   EEG data of each electrode is cut into 40 data units according to the
   data size in a period. In our work we first train the deep learning
   network with 25 data units on each electrode separately and then test
   with 15 data units to get the accuracy on each electrode. Finally we
   will combine the learning results on 16 electrodes and train them with
   SVM and get a final result. We report a 92\% accuracy after combining 16
   electrodes of each person. In order to improve the deep learning model
   on Alzheimer's disease with the upcoming new data, we use incremental
   learning to make full use of the existing data while decrease the
   expenses on memory space and computing time by replacing the exising
   data with new data. We report a 0.5\% improvement in accuracy with

Journal = {{BEHAVIOURAL NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2015}},
Abstract = {{We compared specific (i.e., associated with a unique time and space) and
   general (i.e., extended or repeated events) autobiographical memories
   (AbM) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The comparison aims at investigating
   the relationship between these two components of AbM across the lifespan
   and the volume of cerebral regions of interest within the temporal lobe.
   We hypothesized that the ability to elicit specific memories would
   correlate with hippocampal volume, whereas evoking general memories
   would be related to lateral temporal lobe. AbM was assessed using the
   modified Crovitz test in 18 patients with early AD and 18 matched
   controls. The proportions of total memories-supposed to reflect the
   ability to produce general memories- and specific memories retrieved
   were compared between ADpatients and controls. Correlations to MRI
   volumes of temporal cortex were tested. We found different temporal
   patterns for specific and general memories in AD patients, with (i)
   relatively spared generalmemories, according to a temporal gradient that
   preserved remote memories, predominantly associated with right lateral
   temporal cortex volume. (ii) Conversely, the retrieval of specific AbMs
   was impaired for all life periods and correlated with bilateral
   hippocampal volumes. Our results highlight a shift from an initially
   episodic to a semantic nature of AbMs during AD, where the abstracted
   form of memories remains.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Observing the effects of a drug on episodic memory and the
   underlying brain function has extreme significance in evaluating its
   therapeutic value in treating amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
   Objective: To observe the effects of Bushen capsule (BSC), a Chinese
   herbal medicine, on episodic memory in aMCI and further explore the
   underlying mechanism.
   Methods: 44 aMCI patients from hospitals and local communities in
   Beijing were randomly divided into the BSC treatment group (22 patients
   orally treated with BSC) and the placebo group (22 patients treated with
   placebo). The duration of intervention lasted for 3 months. Before and
   after the 3 months treatment, neuropsychological tests and fMRI
   examinations were carried out to assess cognitive ability and brain
   activation changes, respectively.
   Results: Compared to the placebo group, the BSC group presented a
   significant increase in the AVLT(N5) (p = 0.003) and Stroop (C-B) time
   (p = 0.002). fMRI results showed a reduction of brain negative
   activation in the right middle temporal gyrus and a positive activation
   enhancement in the right putamen among the BSC group after treatment.
   Meanwhile, the variation in activation values in the right middle
   temporal gyrus was significantly correlated with the improvement in test
   values of AVLT(N5), and the variation in deactivation values in the
   right putamen was significantly correlated with the improvement in test
   values of Stroop (C-B) time.
   Conclusions: BSC can improve the behavioral performances of episodic
   memory in aMCI; this effect may be related to its modulation on the
   activations of the temporal lobe and the putamen under episodic memory

Abstract = {{Deficits in semantic memory in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment (aMCI) have been previously reported, but the underlying
   neurobiological mechanisms remain to be clarified. We examined
   event-related potentials (ERPs) associated with semantic memory
   retrieval in 16 individuals with aMCI as compared to 17 normal controls
   using the Semantic Object Retrieval Task (EEG SORT). In this task,
   subjects judged whether pairs of words (object features) elicited
   retrieval of an object (retrieval trials) or not (non-retrieval trials).
   Behavioral findings revealed that aMCI subjects had lower accuracy
   scores and marginally longer reaction time compared to controls. We used
   a multivariate analytical technique (STAT-PCA) to investigate
   similarities and differences in ERPs between aMCI and control groups.
   STAT-PCA revealed a left fronto-temporal component starting at around
   750 ms post-stimulus in both groups. However, unlike controls, aMCI
   subjects showed an increase in the frontal-parietal scalp potential that
   distinguished retrieval from non-retrieval trials between 950 and 1050
   ms post-stimulus negatively correlated with the performance on the
   logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III. Thus,
   individuals with aMCI were not only impaired in their behavioral
   performance on SORT relative to controls, but also displayed alteration
   in the corresponding ERPs. The altered neural activity in aMCI compared
   to controls suggests a more sustained and effortful search during object
   memory retrieval, which may be a potential marker indicating disease
   processes at the pre-dementia stage.}},

Abstract = {{This study is based on the recent discovery of massive and
   well-structured cross-modal memory activation generated in the primary
   visual cortex (V1) of totally blind people as a result of novel training
   in drawing without any vision (Likova, 2012). This unexpected functional
   reorganization of primary visual cortex was obtained after undergoing
   only a week of training by the novel Cognitive-Kinesthetic Method, and
   was consistent across pilot groups of different categories of visual
   deprivation: congenitally blind, late-onset blind and blindfolded
   (Likova, 2014). These findings led us to implicate V1 as the
   implementation of the theoretical visuo-spatial `sketchpad' for working
   memory in the human brain. Since neither the source nor the subsequent
   `recipient' of this non-visual memory information in V1 is known, these
   results raise a number of important questions about the underlying
   functional organization of the respective encoding and retrieval
   networks in the brain.
   To address these questions, an individual totally blind from birth was
   given a week of Cognitive-Kinesthetic training, accompanied by
   functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) both before and just after
   training, and again after a two-month consolidation period. The results
   revealed a remarkable temporal sequence of training-based response
   reorganization in both the hippocampal complex and the temporal-lobe
   object processing hierarchy over the prolonged consolidation period. In
   particular, a pattern of profound learning-based transformations in the
   hippocampus was strongly reflected in V1, with the retrieval function
   showing massive growth as result of the Cognitive-Kinesthetic memory
   training and consolidation, while the initially strong hippocampal
   response during tactile exploration and encoding became non-existent.
   Furthermore, after training, an alternating patch structure in the form
   of a cascade of discrete ventral regions underwent radical
   transformations to reach complete functional specialization in terms of
   either encoding or retrieval as a function of the stage of learning.
   Moreover, several distinct patterns of learning-evolution within the
   patches as a function of their anatomical location, implying a complex
   reorganization of the object processing sub-networks through the
   learning period.
   These first findings of complex patterns of training-based
   encoding/retrieval reorganization thus have broad implications for a
   newly emerging view of the perception/memory interactions and their
   reorganization through the learning process. Note that the temporal
   evolution of these forms of extended functional reorganization could not
   be uncovered with conventional assessment paradigms used in the
   traditional approaches to functional mapping, which may therefore have
   to be revisited. Moreover, as the present results are obtained in
   learning under life-long blindness, they imply modality-independent
   operations, transcending the usual tight association with visual
   processing. The present approach of memory drawing training in
   blindness, has the dual-advantage of being both non-visual and causal
   intervention, which makes it a promising `scalpel' to disentangle
   interactions among diverse cognitive functions.}},

Abstract = {{We propose an infrastructure for the automated anonymization, extraction
   and processing of image data stored in clinical data repositories to
   make routinely acquired imaging data available for research purposes.
   The automated system, which was tested in the context of analyzing
   routinely acquired MR brain imaging data, consists of four modules:
   subject selection using PACS query, anonymization of privacy sensitive
   information and removal of facial features, quality assurance on DICOM
   header and image information, and quantitative imaging biomarker
   extraction. In total, 1,616 examinations were selected based on the
   following MRI scanning protocols: dementia protocol (246), multiple
   sclerosis protocol (446) and open question protocol (924). We evaluated
   the effectiveness of the infrastructure in accessing and successfully
   extracting biomarkers from routinely acquired clinical imaging data. To
   examine the validity, we compared brain volumes between patient groups
   with positive and negative diagnosis, according to the patient reports.
   Overall, success rates of image data retrieval and automatic processing
   were 82.5 \%, 82.3 \% and 66.2 \% for the three protocol groups
   respectively, indicating that a large percentage of routinely acquired
   clinical imaging data can be used for brain volumetry research, despite
   image heterogeneity. In line with the literature, brain volumes were
   found to be significantly smaller (p-value < 0.001) in patients with a
   positive diagnosis of dementia (915 ml) compared to patients with a
   negative diagnosis (939 ml). This study demonstrates that quantitative
   image biomarkers such as intracranial and brain volume can be extracted
   from routinely acquired clinical imaging data. This enables secondary
   use of clinical images for research into quantitative biomarkers at a

Abstract = {{There has been a growing need for in vitro models of neurodegenerative
   diseases such as Alzheimer's disease that would enable a better
   understanding of etiology and faster development of treatment
   strategies. However, meeting this demand has been held back by the
   limited ability to mimic the in vivo microenvironment in an in vitro
   system. Here, we developed a microfluidic chip based on
   three-dimensional (3D) neurospheroids that more closely mimics the in
   vivo brain microenvironment by providing a constant flow of fluid that
   is readily observed in the interstitial space of the brain. Uniform
   neurospheroids, with cell-cell interactions and contacts in all
   directions, were formed in concave microwell arrays, and a slow
   interstitial level of flow was maintained using an osmotic micropump
   system. Using this platform, we investigated the effect of flow on
   neurospheroid size, neural network, and neural differentiation.
   Neurospheroids cultured with flow were larger and formed more robust and
   complex neural networks than those cultured under static conditions,
   suggesting an effect of the interstitial level of slow and
   diffusion-dominant flow on continuous nutrient, oxygen, and cytokine
   transport and removal of metabolic wastes. We also tested the toxic
   effects of amyloid-beta, which is generally considered to be the major
   contributor in Alzheimer's disease. Amyloid-beta treatment via an
   osmotic micropump significantly reduced the viability of neurospheroids
   and caused a significantly more destruction of neural networks, compared
   to the amyloid-beta treatment under static conditions. By adding in
   vivo-like microenvironments, we propose this 3D culture-based
   microfluidic chip as an in vitro brain model for neurodegenerative
   disease and high-throughput drug screening.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's, an irreparable brain disease, impairs thinking and memory
   while the aggregate mind size shrinks which at last prompts demise.
   Early diagnosis of AD is essential for the progress of more prevailing
   treatments. Machine learning (ML), a branch of artificial intelligence,
   employs a variety of probabilistic and optimization techniques that
   permits PCs to gain from vast and complex datasets. As a result,
   researchers focus on using machine learning frequently for diagnosis of
   early stages of AD. This paper presents a review, analysis and critical
   evaluation of the recent work done for the early detection of AD using
   ML techniques. Several methods achieved promising prediction accuracies,
   however they were evaluated on different pathologically unproven data
   sets from different imaging modalities making it difficult to make a
   fair comparison among them. Moreover, many other factors such as
   pre-processing, the number of important attributes for feature
   selection, class imbalance distinctively affect the assessment of the
   prediction accuracy. To overcome these limitations, a model is proposed
   which comprise of initial pre-processing step followed by imperative
   attributes selection and classification is achieved using association
   rule mining. Furthermore, this proposed model based approach gives the
   right direction for research in early diagnosis of AD and has the
   potential to distinguish AD from healthy controls.}},

Abstract = {{Tests of generative semantic verbal fluency are widely used to study
   organization and representation of concepts in the human brain. Previous
   studies demonstrated that clustering and switching behavior during
   verbal fluency tasks is supported by multiple brain mechanisms
   associated with semantic memory and executive control. Previous work
   relied on manual assessments of semantic relatedness between words and
   grouping of words into semantic clusters. We investigated a
   computational linguistic approach to measuring the strength of semantic
   relatedness between words based on latent semantic analysis of word
   co-occurrences in a subset of a large online encyclopedia. We computed
   semantic clustering indices and compared them to brain network
   connectivity measures obtained with task-free fMRI in a sample
   consisting of healthy participants and those differentially affected by
   cognitive impairment. We found that semantic clustering indices were
   associated with brain network connectivity in distinct areas including
   fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal and fusiform gyrus regions. This study
   shows that computerized semantic indices complement traditional
   assessments of verbal fluency to provide a more complete account of the
   relationship between brain and verbal behavior involved organization and
   retrieval of lexical information from memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Month = {{DEC}},
Abstract = {{Alcoholism is a severe disorder that affects the functionality of
   neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) and alters the behavior of
   the affected person. Electroencephalogram(EEG) signals can be used as a
   diagnostic tool in the evaluation of subjects with alcoholism. The
   neurophysiological interpretation of EEG signals in persons with
   alcoholism(PWA) is based on observation and interpretation of the
   frequency and power in their EEGs compared to EEG signals from persons
   without alcoholism. This paper presents a review of the known features
   of EEGs obtained from PWA and proposes that the impact of alcoholism on
   the brain can be determined by computer-aided analysis of EEGs through
   extracting the minute variations in the EEG signals that can
   differentiate the EEGs of PWA from those of nonaffected persons. The
   authors advance the idea of automated computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) of
   alcoholism by employing the EEG signals. This is achieved through
   judicious combination of signal processing techniques such as wavelet,
   nonlinear dynamics, and chaos theory and pattern recognition and
   classification techniques. A CAD system is cost-effective and efficient
   and can be used as a decision support system by physicians in the
   diagnosis and treatment of alcoholism especially those who do not
   specialize in alcoholism or neurophysiology. It can also be of great
   value to rehabilitation centers to assess PWA over time and to monitor
   the impact of treatment aimed at minimizing or reversing the effects of
   the disease on the brain. A CAD system can be used to determine the
   extent of alcoholism-related changes in EEG signals (low, medium, high)
   and the effectiveness of therapeutic plans. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {{Autism is a type of neurodevelopmental disorder affecting the memory,
   behavior, emotion, learning ability, and communication of an individual.
   An early detection of the abnormality, due to irregular processing in
   the brain, can be achieved using electroencephalograms (EEG). The
   variations in the EEG signals cannot be deciphered by mere visual
   inspection. Computer-aided diagnostic tools can be used to recognize the
   subtle and invisible information present in the irregular EEG pattern
   and diagnose autism. This paper presents a state-of-the-art review of
   automated EEG-based diagnosis of autism. Various time domain, frequency
   domain, time-frequency domain, and nonlinear dynamics for the analysis
   of autistic EEG signals are described briefly. A focus of the review is
   the use of nonlinear dynamics and chaos theory to discover the
   mathematical biomarkers for the diagnosis of the autism analogous to
   biological markers. A combination of the time-frequency and nonlinear
   dynamic analysis is the most effective approach to characterize the
   nonstationary and chaotic physiological signals for the automated
   EEG-based diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The features
   extracted using these nonlinear methods can be used as mathematical
   markers to detect the early stage of autism and aid the clinicians in

Abstract = {{Very preterm (VPT) birth is considered a risk factor not only for
   neurological impairment, but also for reduced function in several
   cognitive domains in childhood and later in life. Individuals who were
   born VPT are more likely to demonstrate learning and memory difficulties
   compared to term-born controls. These problems contribute to more
   VPT-born children repeating grades and underachieving in school. This,
   in turn, affects their prospects in adult life. Here we aimed to 1)
   study how the VPT-born adult brain functionally recruited specific areas
   during learning, i.e. encoding and recall across four repeated blocks of
   verbal stimuli, and to investigate how these patterns of activation
   differed from term-born subjects; and 2) probe the microstructural
   differences of white-matter tracts connecting these areas to other parts
   of the learning and memory network. To investigate these
   functional-structural relationships we analyzed functional and
   diffusion-weighted MRI. Functional-MRI and a verbal paired associate
   learning (VPAL) task were used to extract Blood Oxygenation Level
   Dependent (BOLD) activity in 21 VPT-born adults (<33 weeks of gestation)
   (mean age: 19.68 years +/- 0.85; IQ: 99.86 +/- 11.20) and 10 term-born
   controls (mean age: 19.87 years +/- 2.04; IQ: 108.9 +/- 13.18). Areas in
   which differences in functional activation were observed between groups
   were used as seed regions for tractography. Fractional anisotropy (FA)
   of the tract-skeleton was then compared between groups on a voxel-wise
   basis. Results of functional MRI analysis showed a significantly
   different pattern of activation between groups during encoding in right
   anterior cingulate-caudate body, and during retrieval in left thalamus,
   hippocampus and parts of left posterior parahippocampal gyrus. The
   number of correctly recalled word pairs did not statistically differ
   between individuals who were born VPT and controls. The VPT-born group
   was found to have reduced FA in tracts passing through the
   thalamic/hippocampal region that was differently activated during the
   recall condition, with the hippocampal fornix, inferior longitudinal
   fasciculus and inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus particularly
   affected.
   Young adults who were born very preterm display a strikingly different
   pattern of activation during the process of learning in key structures
   of the learning and memory network, including anterior cingulate and
   caudate body during encoding and thalamus/parahippocampal gyrus during
   cued recall. Altered activation in thalamus/parahippocampal gyrus may be
   explained by reduced connections between these areas and the
   hippocampus, which may be a direct consequence of neonatal
   hypoxic/ischemic injury.
   These results could reflect the effect of adaptive plastic processes
   associated with high-order cognitive functions, at least when the
   cognitive load remains relatively low, as ex-preterm young adults
   displayed unimpaired performance in completing the verbal paired
   associate learning task. c 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The capacity to remember self-referential past events relies on the
   integrity of a distributed neural network. Controversy exists, however,
   regarding the involvement of specific brain structures for the retrieval
   of recently experienced versus more distant events. Here, we explored
   how characteristic patterns of atrophy in neurodegenerative disorders
   differentially disrupt remote versus recent autobiographical memory.
   Eleven behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia, 10 semantic
   dementia, 15 Alzheimer's disease patients and 14 healthy older Controls
   completed the Autobiographical Interview. All patient groups displayed
   significant remote memory impairments relative to Controls. Similarly,
   recent period retrieval was significantly compromised in
   behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, yet
   semantic dementia patients scored in line with Controls. Voxel-based
   morphometry and diffusion tensor imaging analyses, for all participants
   combined, were conducted to investigate grey and white matter correlates
   of remote and recent autobiographical memory retrieval. Neural
   correlates common to both recent and remote time periods were
   identified, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal, and
   frontopolar cortices, and the forceps minor and left hippocampal portion
   of the cingulum bundle. Regions exclusively implicated in each time
   period were also identified. The integrity of the anterior temporal
   cortices was related to the retrieval of remote memories, whereas the
   posterior cingulate cortex emerged as a structure significantly
   associated with recent autobiographical memory retrieval. This study
   represents the first investigation of the grey and white matter
   correlates of remote and recent autobiographical memory retrieval in
   neurodegenerative disorders. Our findings demonstrate the importance of
   core brain structures, including the medial prefrontal cortex and
   hippocampus, irrespective of time period, and point towards the
   contribution of discrete regions in mediating successful retrieval of
   distant versus recently experienced events.}},

   and visual texture information: A functional MRI study}},
Journal = {{NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{64}},
Pages = {{252-262}},
Month = {{NOV}},
Abstract = {{Visual clues as to the physical substance of manufactured objects can be
   misleading. For example, a plastic ring can appear to be made of gold.
   However, we can avoid misidentifying an object's substance by comparing
   visual and tactile information. As compared to the spatial properties of
   an object (e.g., orientation), however, little information regarding
   physical object properties (material properties) is shared between
   vision and touch. How can such different kinds of information be
   compared in the brain? One possibility is that the visuo-tactile
   comparison of material information is mediated by associations that are
   previously learned between the two modalities. Previous studies suggest
   that a cortical network involving the medial temporal lobe and precuneus
   plays a critical role in the retrieval of information from long-term
   memory. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to
   test whether these brain regions are involved in the visuo-tactile
   comparison of material properties. The stimuli consisted of surfaces in
   which an oriented plastic bar was placed on a background texture.
   Twenty-two healthy participants determined whether the orientations of
   visually- and tactually-presented bar stimuli were congruent in the
   orientation conditions, and whether visually- and tactually-presented
   background textures were congruent in the texture conditions. The
   texture conditions revealed greater activation of the fusiform gyrus,
   medial temporal lobe and lateral prefrontal cortex compared with the
   orientation conditions. In the texture conditions, the precuneus showed
   greater response to incongruent stimuli than to congruent stimuli. This
   incongruency effect was greater for the texture conditions than for the
   orientation conditions. These results suggest that the precuneus is
   involved in detecting incongruency between tactile and visual texture
   information in concert with the medial temporal lobe, which is tightly
   linked with long-term memory. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Vestibular neuritis (VN) is a sudden peripheral unilateral vestibular
   failure with often persistent head movement-related dizziness and
   unsteadiness. Compensation of asymmetrical activity in the primary
   peripheral vestibular afferents is accomplished by restoration of
   impaired brainstem vestibulo-ocular and vestibulo-spinal reflexes, but
   presumably also by changing cortical vestibular tone imbalance
   subserving, e.g., spatial perception and orientation. The aim of this
   study was to elucidate (i) whether there are changes of cerebral
   resting-state networks with respect to functional interregional
   connectivity (resting-state activity) in VN patients and (ii) whether
   these are related to neurophysiological, perceptual and functional
   parameters of vestibular-induced disability. Using independent component
   analysis (ICA), we compared resting-state networks between 20 patients
   with unilateral VN and 20 age- and gender-matched healthy control
   subjects. Patients were examined in the acute VN stage and after 3
   months. A neural network (component 50) comprising the parietal lobe,
   medial aspect of the superior parietal lobule, posterior cingulate
   cortex, middle frontal gyrus, middle temporal gyrus, parahippocampal
   gyrus, anterior cingulate cortex, insular cortex, caudate nucleus,
   thalamus and midbrain was modulated between acute VN patients and
   healthy controls and in patients over time. Within this network, acute
   VN patients showed decreased resting-state activity (ICA) in the
   contralateral intraparietal sulcus (IPS), in close vicinity to the
   supramarginal gyrus (SMG), which increased after 3 months. Resting-state
   activity in IPS tended to increase over 3 months in VN patients who
   improved with respect to functional parameters of vestibular-induced
   disability (VADL). Resting-state activity in the IPS was not related to
   perceptual (subjective visual vertical) or neurophysiological parameters
   of vestibular-induced disability (e.g., gain of vestibulo-ocular reflex,
   caloric responsiveness, postural sway). VN leads to a change in
   resting-state activity of the contralateral IPS adjacent to the SMG,
   which reverses during vestibular compensation over 3 months. The ventral
   intraparietal area in the IPS contains multimodal regions with
   directionally selective responses to vestibular stimuli making them
   suitable for participating in spatial orientation and multisensory
   integration. The clinical importance is indicated by the fact that the
   increase in resting-state activity tended to be larger in those patients
   with only little disability at the follow-up examination. This may
   indicate powerful restitution-related or compensatory cortical changes
   in resting-state activity.}},

Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{101}},
Pages = {{569-582}},
Month = {{NOV 1}},
Abstract = {{For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a
   potential tool for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its
   prodromal stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of
   different modalities can further provide the complementary information
   to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we focus on the problems of both
   feature representation and fusion of multimodal information from
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET).
   To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature mostly
   used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter
   densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined
   these multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or
   transforming into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we
   propose a novel method for a high-level latent and shared feature
   representation from neuroimaging modalities via deep learning.
   Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)(2), a deep network
   with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block, to find a
   latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then
   devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the
   paired patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the
   effectiveness of the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI

Abstract = {{The hippocampus plays a key role in the encoding and retrieval of
   information related to novel environments during spatial navigation.
   However, the neural basis for these processes in the human hippocampus
   remains unknown because it is difficult to directly measure neural
   signals in the human hippocampus. This study investigated hippocampal
   neural oscillations involved in encoding novel environments during
   spatial navigation in a virtual environment. Seven epileptic patients
   with implanted intracranial hippocampal depth electrodes performed three
   sessions of virtual environment navigation. Each session consisted of a
   navigation task and a location-recall task. The navigation task
   consisted of eight blocks, and in each block, the participant navigated
   to the location of four different objects and was instructed to remember
   the location of the objects. After the eight blocks were completed, a
   location-recall task was performed for each of the four objects.
   Intracranial electroencephalography data were monitored during the
   navigation tasks. Theta (5-8 Hz) and delta (1-4 Hz) oscillations were
   lower in the first block (novel environment) than in the eighth block
   (familiar environment) of the navigation task, and significantly
   increased from block one to block eight. By contrast, low-gamma (31-50
   Hz) oscillations were higher in the first block than in the eighth block
   of the navigation task, and significantly decreased from block one to
   block eight. Comparison of sessions with high recall performance (low
   error between identified and actual object location) and low recall
   performance revealed that high-gamma (51-100 Hz) oscillations
   significantly decreased from block one to block eight only in sessions
   with high recall performance. These findings suggest that delta, theta,
   and low-gamma oscillations were associated with encoding of
   environmental novelty and high-gamma oscillations were important for the
   successful encoding of environmental novelty. (c) 2014 Wiley

Abstract = {{ObjectiveVerbal memory difficulties are common among individuals with
   late-life depression (LLD), though there is limited knowledge about
   disruptions to underlying cerebral circuitry. The purpose of this study
   is to examine aberrations to cerebral networks implicated in encoding
   novel verbal semantic material among older adults with LLD.
   MethodsTwenty-four older adults with early-onset LLD and 23
   non-depressed comparisons participated in the study. Participants
   completed a word list-learning task while undergoing functional magnetic
   resonance imaging.
   ResultsIn the context of equivalent recall and recognition of words
   following scanning and similar hippocampal volumes, patients with LLD
   exhibited less activation in structures known to be relevant for new
   learning and memory, including hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus,
   insula, and cingulate, relative to non-ill comparisons. An important
   region in which the LLD group displayed greater activation than the
   non-depressed comparison group was in left inferior frontal gyrus, an
   area involved in cognitive control and controlled semantic/phonological
   retrieval and analysis; this region may be critical for LLD patients to
   consolidate encoded words into memory.
   ConclusionsFunctional irregularities found in LLD patients may reflect
   different modes of processing to-be-remembered information and/or early
   changes predictive of incipient cognitive decline. Future studies might
   consider mechanisms that could contribute to these functional
   differences, including hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis functioning
   and vascular integrity, and utilize longitudinal designs in order to
   understand whether functional changes are predictive of incipient
   cognitive decline. Copyright (c) 2014 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.}},

Abstract = {{Refractory epilepsy often has deleterious effects on an individual's
   health and quality of life. Early identification of patients whose
   seizures are refractory to antiepileptic drugs is important in
   considering the use of alternative treatments. Although idiopathic
   epilepsy is regarded as having a significantly lower risk factor of
   developing refractory epilepsy, still a subset of patients with
   idiopathic epilepsy might be refractory to medical treatment. In this
   study, we developed an effective method to predict the refractoriness of
   idiopathic epilepsy. Sixteen EEG segments from 12 well-controlled
   patients and 14 EEG segments from 11 refractory patients were analyzed
   at the time of first EEG recordings before antiepileptic drug treatment.
   Ten crucial EEG feature descriptors were selected for classification.
   Three of 10 were related to decorrelation time, and four of 10 were
   related to relative power of delta/gamma. There were significantly
   higher values in these seven feature descriptors in the well-controlled
   group as compared to the refractory group. On the contrary, the
   remaining three feature descriptors related to spectral edge frequency,
   kurtosis, and energy of wavelet coefficients demonstrated significantly
   lower values in the well-controlled group as compared to the refractory
   group. The analyses yielded a weighted precision rate of 94.2\%, and a
   93.3\% recall rate. Therefore, the developed method is a useful tool in
   identifying the possibility of developing refractory epilepsy in
   patients with idiopathic epilepsy.}},

Abstract = {{Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the
   periphery and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white
   matter (WM) based on the whitish appearance of the exceptionally high
   lipid content of the myelin sheaths encasing neuronal axons. These
   simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended to conceptually
   segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have been
   codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into
   medicine, psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete
   classifications have helped obscure the importance of continual dynamic
   communication between all brain cell types (neurons, astrocytes,
   microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2) cells) as well as
   between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems. The
   signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin,
   and multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that
   together help integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination
   processes and orchestrate the development, plasticity, maintenance, and
   repair that continually optimize function of neural networks. A more
   comprehensive, evolution-based, systems biology approach that integrates
   brain, body, and environmental interactions may ultimately prove more
   fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain function. The
   historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting the
   importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent
   age-related shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms
   that can lead to remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric
   diseases. Herein we highlight the role of glia, especially the most
   recently evolved oligodendrocytes and the myelin they produce, in
   achieving and maintaining optimal brain function. The human brain
   undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination (even
   throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid
   conduction and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal
   function depends. The continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability
   resulting from the human brain's protracted myelination underlies
   underappreciated communalities between different disease phenotypes
   ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and bipolar
   disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored
   opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have
   the potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of
   neuropsychiatric disease.}},

Abstract = {{This study investigated the impact of Alzheimer's disease (AD) on
   conjunctive and relational binding in episodic memory. Mild AD patients
   and controls had to remember item-color associations by imagining color
   either as a contextual association (relational memory) or as a feature
   of the item to be encoded (conjunctive memory). Patients' performance in
   each condition was correlated with cerebral metabolism measured by
   FDG-PET. The results showed that AD patients had an impaired capacity to
   remember item-color associations, with deficits in both relational and
   conjunctive memory. However, performance in the two kinds of associative
   memory varied independently across patients. Partial Least Square
   analyses revealed that poor conjunctive memory was related to
   hypometabolism in an anterior temporal-posterior fusiform brain network,
   whereas relational memory correlated with metabolism in regions of the
   default mode network. These findings support the hypothesis of distinct
   neural systems specialized in different types of associative memory and
   point to heterogeneous profiles of memory alteration in Alzheimer's
   disease as a function of damage to the respective neural networks. (C)

Abstract = {{Normal aging is associated with cognitive decline. Evidence indicates
   that large-scale brain networks are affected by aging; however, it has
   not been established whether aging has equivalent effects on specific
   large-scale networks. In the present study, 40 healthy subjects
   including 22 older (aged 60-80 years) and 18 younger (aged 22-33 years)
   adults underwent resting-state functional MRI scanning. Four canonical
   resting-state networks, including the default mode network (DMN),
   executive control network (ECN), dorsal attention network (DAN) and
   salience network, were extracted, and the functional connectivities in
   these canonical networks were compared between the younger and older
   groups. We found distinct, disruptive alterations present in the
   large-scale aging-related resting brain networks: the ECN was affected
   the most, followed by the DAN. However, the DMN and salience networks
   showed limited functional connectivity disruption. The visual network
   served as a control and was similarly preserved in both groups. Our
   findings suggest that the aged brain is characterized by selective
   vulnerability in large-scale brain networks. These results could help

Abstract = {{The detection of nonconvulsive seizures (NCSz) is a challenge because of
   the lack of physical symptoms, which may delay the diagnosis of the
   disease. Many researchers have reported automatic detection of seizures.
   However, few investigators have concentrated on detection of NCSz. This
   article proposes a method for reliable detection of NCSz. The
   electroencephalography (EEG) signal is usually contaminated by various
   nonstationary noises. Signal denoising is an important preprocessing
   step in the analysis of such signals. In this study, a new wavelet-based
   denoising approach using cubical thresholding has been proposed to
   reduce noise from the EEG signal prior to analysis. Three statistical
   features were extracted from wavelet frequency bands, encompassing the
   frequency range of 0 to 8, 8 to 16, 16 to 32, and 0 to 32 Hz. Extracted
   features were used to train linear classifier to discriminate between
   normal and seizure EEGs. The performance of the method was tested on a
   database of nine patients with 24 seizures in 80 hours of EEG recording.
   All the seizures were successfully detected, and false positive rate was

Abstract = {{Clinical trials of the PET amyloid imaging agent F-18-flutemetamol have
   used visual assessment to classify PET scans as negative or positive for
   brain amyloid. However, quantification provides additional information
   about regional and global tracer uptake and may have utility for image
   assessment over time and across different centers. Using postmortem
   brain neuritic plaque density data as a truth standard to derive a
   standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) threshold, we assessed a fully
   automated quantification method comparing visual and quantitative scan
   categorizations. We also compared the histopathology-derived SUVR
   threshold with one derived from healthy controls. Methods: Data from 345
   consenting subjects enrolled in 8 prior clinical trials of
   F-18-flutemetamol injection were used. We grouped subjects into 3
   cohorts: an autopsy cohort (n = 68) comprising terminally ill patients
   with postmortem confirmation of brain amyloid status; a test cohort (n =
   172) comprising 33 patients with clinically probable Alzheimer disease,
   80 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 59 healthy volunteers;
   and a healthy cohort of 105 volunteers, used to define a reference range
   for SUVR. Visual image categorizations for comparison were from a
   previous study. A fully automated PET-only quantification method was
   used to compute regional neocortical SUVRs that were combined into a
   single composite SUVR. An SUVR threshold for classifying scans as
   positive or negative was derived by ranking the PET scans from the
   autopsy cohort based on their composite SUVR and comparing data with the
   standard of truth based on postmortem brain amyloid status for subjects
   in the autopsy cohort. The derived threshold was used to categorize the
   172 scans in the test cohort as negative or positive, and results were
   compared with categorization using visual assessment. Different
   reference and composite region definitions were assessed. Threshold
   levels were also compared with corresponding thresholds derived from the
   healthy group. Results: Automated quantification (using pons as the
   reference region) demonstrated 91\% sensitivity and 88\% specificity and
   gave 3 false-positive and 4 false-negative scans. All 3 false-positive
   cases were either borderline-normal by standard of truth or had moderate
   to heavy cortical diffuse plaque burden. In the test cohort, the
   concordance between quantitative and visual read categorization ranged
   from 97.1\% to 99.4\% depending on the selection of reference and
   composite regions. The threshold derived from the healthy group was
   close to the histopathology-derived threshold. Conclusion:
   Categorization of F-18-flutemetamol amyloid imaging data using an
   automated PET-only quantification method showed good agreement with
   histopathologic classification of neuritic plaque density and a strong
   concordance with visual read results.}},

Abstract = {{The rate of exceptionally slow reaction times (RTs), described by the
   long tail of the RT distribution, was found to be amplified in a variety
   of special populations with cognitive deficits (e. g., early-stage
   Alzheimer's disease, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, low
   intelligence, elderly). Previous individual differences studies found
   high correlations between working memory (WM) and parameters that
   characterize the magnitude of the long-RT tail. However, the causal
   direction remains unknown. In 3 choice-reaction task experiments, we
   examined this relationship by directly manipulating WM availability. In
   Experiment 1, the stimulus-response rules were either arbitrary (WM
   demanding) or nonarbitrary. In Experiment 2, the arbitrary rules were
   either novel (demanding) or practiced. In Experiment 3, WM was loaded
   with either declarative (stimulus-stimulus) or procedural
   (stimulus-response) arbitrary rules. Using an ex-Gaussian model fitting,
   we found across all experiments that WM demands uniquely influenced the
   tau parameter, mostly responsible for the long-RT distribution tail.
   Evidence accumulation modeling of the choice process indicated that WM
   load had little influence on the decision process itself and primarily
   affected the duration of an exponentially distributed nondecision

   Methods: Forty-five participants (healthy controls (HC) = 31, MCI = 14)
   completed the Episodic ABM Interview and a battery of memory tests.
   Thirty-one (HC = 22, MCI = 9) underwent beta-amyloid positron emission

   participants (HC = 9, MCI = 5) underwent one imaging modality.
   Results: Unlike PSM, ABM differentiated between diagnostic categories

   related to neocortical beta-amyloid burden after adjusting for age and
   apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4. Autonoetic consciousness was not

   Conclusions: Autobiographical memory was impaired in MCI participants

Abstract = {{Linking structural neuroimaging data from multiple modalities to
   cognitive performance is an important challenge for cognitive
   neuroscience. In this study we examined the relationship between verbal
   fluency performance and neuroanatomy in 54 patients with frontotemporal
   degeneration (FTD) and 15 age-matched controls, all of whom had T1- and
   diffusion-weighted imaging. Our goal was to incorporate measures of both
   gray matter (voxel-based cortical thickness) and white matter
   (fractional anisotropy) into a single statistical model that relates to
   behavioral performance. We first used eigenanatomy to define data-driven
   regions of interest (DD-ROIs) for both gray matter and white matter.
   Eigenanatomy is a multivariate dimensionality reduction approach that
   identifies spatially smooth, unsigned principal components that explain
   the maximal amount of variance across subjects. We then used a
   statistical model selection procedure to see which of these DD-ROIs best
   modeled performance on verbal fluency tasks hypothesized to rely on
   distinct components of a large-scale neural network that support
   language: category fluency requires a semantic-guided search and is
   hypothesized to rely primarily on temporal cortices that support
   lexical-semantic representations; letter-guided fluency requires a
   strategic mental search and is hypothesized to require executive
   resources to support a more demanding search process, which depends on
   prefrontal cortex in addition to temporal network components that
   support lexical representations. We observed that both types of verbal
   fluency performance are best described by a network that includes a
   combination of gray matter and white matter. For category fluency, the
   identified regions included bilateral temporal cortex and a white matter
   region including left inferior longitudinal fasciculus and
   frontal-occipital fasciculus. For letter fluency, a left temporal lobe
   region was also selected, and also regions of frontal cortex. These
   results are consistent with our hypothesized neuroanatomical models of
   language processing and its breakdown in FTD. We conclude that
   clustering the data with eigenanatomy before performing linear
   regression is a promising tool for multimodal data analysis. (C) 2014

Abstract = {{In the present work we analyzed the effect of contextual word
   predictability on the eye movement behavior of patients with mild
   Alzheimer disease (AD) compared to age-matched controls, by using the
   eyetracking technique and lineal mixed models. Twenty AD patients and 40
   age-matched controls participated in the study. We first evaluated gaze
   duration during reading low and highly predictable sentences. AD
   patients showed an increase in gaze duration, compared to controls, both
   in sentences of low or high predictability. In controls, highly
   predictable sentences led to shorter gaze durations; by contrary, AD
   patients showed similar gaze durations in both types of sentences.
   Similarly, gaze duration in controls was affected by the doze
   predictability of word N and N + 1, whereas it was the same in AD
   patients. In contrast, the effects of word frequency and word length
   were similar in controls and AD patients. Our results imply that
   contextual-word predictability, whose processing is proposed to require
   memory retrieval, facilitated reading behavior in healthy subjects, but
   this facilitation was lost in early AD patients. This loss might reveal
   impairments in brain areas such as those corresponding to working
   memory, memory retrieval, and semantic memory functions that are already
   present at early stages of AD. In contrast, word frequency and length
   processing might require less complex mechanisms, which were still
   retained by AD patients. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   study measuring how patients with early AD process well-defined words
   embedded in sentences of high and low predictability. Evaluation of the
   resulting changes in eye movement behavior might provide a useful tool
   for a more precise early diagnosis of AD. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{The default mode network (DMN) is a reliably elicited functional neural
   network with potential clinical implications. Its discriminant and
   prognostic utility following traumatic axonal injury (TAI) have not been
   previously investigated. The present study used three approaches to
   analyze DMN functional connectedness, including a whole-brain analysis

   analysis {[}A3]. The purpose was to identify the utility of each method
   in distinguishing between healthy and brain-injured individuals, and
   determine whether observed differences have clinical significance.
   Resting-state fMRI was acquired from 25 patients with TAI and 17 healthy
   controls. Patients were scanned 6-11 months post-injury, and functional
   and neurocognitive outcomes were assessed the same day. Using all three
   approaches, TAI subjects revealed significantly weaker functional
   connectivity (FC) than controls, and binary logistic regressions
   demonstrated all three approaches have discriminant value. Clinical
   outcomes were not correlated with FC using any approach. Results suggest
   that compromise to the functional connectedness of the DMN after TAI can
   be identified using resting-state FC; however, the degree of functional
   compromise to this network, as measured in this study, may not have
   clinical implications in chronic TAI.}},

Abstract = {{Neuroimaging has played an important role in non-invasive diagnosis and
   differentiation of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's
   disease and Mild Cognitive Impairment. Various features have been
   extracted from the neuroimaging data to characterize the disorders, and
   these features can be roughly divided into global and local features.
   Recent studies show a tendency of using local features in disease
   characterization, since they are capable of identifying the subtle
   disease-specific patterns associated with the effects of the disease on
   human brain. However, problems arise if the neuroimaging database
   involved multiple disorders or progressive disorders, as disorders of
   different types or at different progressive stages might exhibit
   different degenerative patterns. It is difficult for the researchers to
   reach consensus on what brain regions could effectively distinguish
   multiple disorders or multiple progression stages. In this study we
   proposed a Multi-Channel pattern analysis approach to identify the most
   discriminative local brain metabolism features for neurodegenerative
   disorder characterization. We compared our method to global methods and
   other pattern analysis methods based on clinical expertise or statistics
   tests. The preliminary results suggested that the proposed Multi-Channel
   pattern analysis method outperformed other approaches in Alzheimer's

Abstract = {{Cognitive training is an emergent approach that has begun to receive
   increased attention in recent years as a non-pharmacological,
   cost-effective intervention for Alzheimer's disease (AD). There has been
   increasing behavioral evidence regarding training-related improvement in
   cognitive performance in early stages of AD. Although these studies
   provide important insight about the efficacy of cognitive training,
   neuroimaging studies are crucial to pinpoint changes in brain structure
   and function associated with training and to examine their overlap with
   pathology in AD. In this study, we reviewed the existing neuroimaging
   studies on cognitive training in persons at risk of developing AD to
   provide an overview of the overlap between neural networks rehabilitated
   by the current training methods and those affected in AD. The data
   suggest a consistent training related increase in brain activity in
   medial temporal, prefrontal, and posterior default mode networks, as
   well as increase in gray matter structure in frontoparietal and
   entorhinal regions. This pattern differs from the observed pattern in
   healthy older adults that shows a combination of increased and decreased
   activity in response to training. Detailed investigation of the data
   suggests that training in persons at risk of developing AD mainly
   improves compensatory mechanisms and partly restores the affected
   functions. While current neuroimaging studies are quite helpful in
   identifying the mechanisms underlying cognitive training, the data calls
   for future multi-modal neuroimaging studies with focus on multi domain
   cognitive training, network level connectivity, and individual
   differences in response to training.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging has been shown to modulate the neural underpinnings of
   autobiographical memory and emotion processing. Moreover, previous
   researches have suggested that aging produces a ``positivity effect{''}
   in autobiographical memory. Although a few imaging studies have
   investigated the neural mechanism of the positivity effect, the neural
   substrates underlying the positivity effect in emotional
   autobiographical memory is unclear. To understand the age-related neural
   changes in emotional autobiographical memory that underlie the
   positivity effect, the present functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) study used the independent component analysis (ICA) method to
   compare brain networks in younger and older adults as they retrieved
   positive and negative autobiographical events. Compared to their younger
   counterparts, older adults reported relatively higher positive feelings
   when retrieving emotional autobiographical events. Imaging data
   indicated an age-related reversal within the ventromedial
   prefrontal/anterior cingulate cortex (VMPFC/ACC) and the left amygdala
   of the brain networks that were engaged in the retrieval of
   autobiographical events with different valence. The retrieval of
   negative events compared to positive events induced stronger activity in
   the VMPFC/ACC and weaker activity in the amygdala for the older adults,
   whereas the younger adults showed a reversed pattern. Moreover, activity
   in the VMPFC/ACC within the task-related networks showed a negative
   correlation with the emotional valence intensity. These results may
   suggest that the positivity effect in older adults' autobiographical
   memories is potentially due to age-related changes in controlled
   emotional processing implemented by the VMPFC/ACC-amygdala circuit.}},

Journal = {{ANNALS OF NEUROLOGY}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{76}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{241-251}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Objective: Episodic memory retrieval is reliant upon cognitive control
   systems, of which 2 have been identified with functional neuroimaging: a
   cingulo-opercular salience network (SN) and a frontoparietal executive
   network (EN). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology is distributed
   throughout higher-order cortices. The hypotheses were that this
   frontoparietal pathology would impair activity associated with verbal
   memory recall; and that central cholinesterase inhibition (ChI) would
   modulate this, improving memory recall.
   Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study normal
   participants and 2 patient groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   AD. Activity within the EN and SN was observed during free recall of
   previously heard sentences, and related to measures of recall accuracy.
   Results: In normal subjects, trials with reduced recall were associated
   with greater activity in both the SN and EN. Better recall was
   associated with greater activity in medial regions of the default mode
   network. By comparison, AD patients showed attenuated responses in both
   the SN and EN compared with either controls or MCI patients, even after
   recall performance was matched between groups. Following ChI, AD
   patients showed no modulation of activity within the SN, but increased
   activity within the EN. There was also enhanced activity within regions
   associated with episodic and semantic memory during less successful
   recall, requiring greater cognitive control.
   Interpretation: The results indicate that in AD, impaired responses of
   cognitive control networks during verbal memory recall are partly
   responsible for reduced recall performance. One action of
   symptom-modifying treatment is partially to reverse the abnormal
   function of frontoparietal cognitive control and temporal lobe memory
   networks.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{57}},
Pages = {{22-37}},
Month = {{AUG}},
Abstract = {{Introduction: Uniform coordinate systems in neuroimaging research have
   enabled comprehensive systematic and quantitative meta-analyses. Such
   approaches are particularly relevant for neuropsychiatric diseases, the
   understanding of their symptoms, prediction and treatment. Behavioral
   variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), a common neurodegenerative
   syndrome, is characterized by deep alterations in behavior and
   personality. Investigating this `nexopathy' elucidates the healthy
   social and emotional brain.
   Methods: Here, we combine three multimodal meta-analyses approaches -
   anatomical and activation likelihood estimates and behavioral domain
   profiles - to identify neural correlates of bvFTD in 417 patients and
   406 control subjects and to extract mental functions associated with
   this disease by meta-analyzing functional activation studies in the
   comprehensive probabilistic functional brain atlas of the BrainMap
   database.
   Results: The analyses identify the frontomedian cortex, basal ganglia,
   anterior insulae and thalamus as most relevant hubs, with a regional
   dissociation between atrophy and hypometabolism. Neural networks
   affected by bvFTD were associated with emotion and reward processing,
   empathy and executive functions (mainly inhibition), suggesting these
   functions as core domains affected by the disease and finally leading to
   its clinical symptoms. In contrast, changes in theory of mind or
   mentalizing abilities seem to be secondary phenomena of executive
   dysfunctions.
   Conclusions: The study creates a novel conceptual framework to
   understand neuropsychiatric diseases by powerful data-driven
   meta-analytic approaches that shall be extended to the whole
   neuropsychiatric spectrum in the future. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All

   using those features deemed statistically significant through an
   elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used
   to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for
   intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results
   obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross
   validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59
   AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The
   study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of
   AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative
   volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral
   ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy
   of 92.4\% (sensitivity: 84.0\%; specificity: 96.1\%). MMSE scores are
   found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2\%

   also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the
   brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for
   aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy
   is seen to be the most significant for aMCI, while Accumbens area and

Abstract = {{To study the effect of acute alcohol intoxication on the functional

   Eleven healthy male volunteers were asked to drink 0.59 g/kg of ethanol.
   Resting state blood oxygen level dependent (rsBOLD) MRI scans were
   obtained before consumption, 60 min post-consumption and 90 min
   post-consumption. Before each rsBOLD scan, pointed-resolved spectroscopy
   (PRESS) H-1-MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) scans were acquired to
   measure ethanol levels in the right basal ganglia.
   Significant changes in DMN connectivity were found following alcohol
   consumption (p < 0.01). Both increased and decreased regional
   connectivity were found after 60 min, whereas mostly decreased
   connectivity was found after 90 min. The fractal behaviour of the rsBOLD
   signal, which is believed to help reveal complexity of small-scale
   neuronal circuitry, became more ordered after both 60 and 90 min of
   alcohol consumption (p < 0.01).
   The DMN has been linked to personal identity and social behavior. As
   such, our preliminary findings may provide insight into the
   neuro-functional underpinnings of the cognitive and behavioral changes

Abstract = {{At a similar stage, patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD)

   investigated. This study aims at characterizing basal functional
   connectivity (FC) patterns of EOAD and LOAD in two groups of 14 patients
   matched for disease duration and severity, relative to age-matched
   controls. All subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological
   assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify atrophy and
   resting-state FC focusing on : the default mode network (DMN), found
   impaired in earlier studies on AD, and the anterior temporal network
   (ATN) and dorso-lateral prefrontal network (DLPFN), respectively
   involved in declarative memory and executive functions. Patterns of
   atrophy and cognitive impairment in EOAD and LOAD were in accordance
   with previous reports. FC within the DMN was similarly decreased in both
   EOAD and LOAD relative to controls. However, a double-dissociated
   pattern of FC changes in ATN and DLPFN was found. EOAD exhibited
   decreased FC in the DLPFN and increased FC in the ATN relative to
   controls, while the reverse pattern was found in LOAD. In addition, ATN
   and DLPFN connectivity correlated respectively with memory and executive
   performances, suggesting that increased FC is here likely to reflect
   compensatory mechanisms. Thus, large-scale neural network changes in

Abstract = {{The brain's default mode network (DMN) is highly heritable and is
   compromised in a variety of psychiatric disorders. However, genetic
   control over the DMN in schizophrenia (SZ) and psychotic bipolar
   disorder (PBP) is largely unknown. Study subjects (n = 1,305) underwent
   a resting-state functional MRI scan and were analyzed by a two-stage
   approach. The initial analysis used independent component analysis (ICA)
   in 324 healthy controls, 296 SZ probands, 300 PBP probands, 179
   unaffected first-degree relatives of SZ probands (SZREL), and 206
   unaffected first-degree relatives of PBP probands to identify DMNs and
   to test their biomarker and/or endophenotype status. A subset of
   controls and probands (n = 549) then was subjected to a parallel ICA
   (para-ICA) to identify imaging-genetic relationships. ICA identified
   three DMNs. Hypo-connectivity was observed in both patient groups in all
   DMNs. Similar patterns observed in SZREL were restricted to only one
   network. DMN connectivity also correlated with several symptom measures.
   Para-ICA identified five sub-DMNs that were significantly associated
   with five different genetic networks. Several top-ranking SNPs across
   these networks belonged to previously identified, well-known
   psychosis/mood disorder genes. Global enrichment analyses revealed
   processes including NMDA-related long-term potentiation, PKA, immune
   response signaling, axon guidance, and synaptogenesis that significantly
   influenced DMN modulation in psychoses. In summary, we observed both
   unique and shared impairments in functional connectivity across the SZ
   and PBP cohorts; these impairments were selectively familial only for
   SZREL. Genes regulating specific neurodevelopment/transmission processes
   primarily mediated DMN disconnectivity. The study thus identifies
   biological pathways related to a widely researched quantitative trait
   that might suggest novel, targeted drug treatments for these diseases.}},

Abstract = {{Background and purposeThe progression pattern of brain structural
   changes in patients with isolated cerebrovascular disease (CVD) remains
   unclear. To investigate the role of isolated CVD in cognitive impairment
   patients, patterns of cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy in pure
   subcortical vascular mild cognitive impairment (svMCI) and pure
   subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD) patients were characterized.
   MethodsForty-five patients with svMCI and 46 patients with SVaD who were
   negative on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography
   imaging and 75 individuals with normal cognition (NC) were recruited.
   ResultsCompared with NC, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited frontal,
   language and retrieval type memory dysfunctions, which in patients with
   PiB(-) SVaD were further impaired and accompanied by visuospatial and
   recognition memory dysfunctions. Compared with NC, patients with PiB(-)
   svMCI exhibited cortical thinning in the frontal, perisylvian, basal
   temporal and posterior cingulate regions. This atrophy was more
   prominent and extended further toward the lateral parietal and medial
   temporal regions in patients with PiB(-) SVaD. Compared with NC
   subjects, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited hippocampal shape
   deformities in the lateral body, whilst patients with PiB(-) SVaD
   exhibited additional deformities within the lateral head and inferior
   body.
   ConclusionsOur findings suggest that patients with CVD in the absence of
   Alzheimer's disease pathology can be demented, showing cognitive
   impairment in multiple domains, which is consistent with the topography
   of cortical thinning and hippocampal shape deformity.}},

Abstract = {{Many contemporary neuroscientific investigations face significant
   challenges in terms of data management, computational processing, data
   mining, and results interpretation. These four pillars define the core
   infrastructure necessary to plan, organize, orchestrate, validate, and
   disseminate novel scientific methods, computational resources, and
   translational healthcare findings. Data management includes protocols
   for data acquisition, archival, query, transfer, retrieval, and
   aggregation. Computational processing involves the necessary software,
   hardware, and networking infrastructure required to handle large amounts
   of heterogeneous neuroimaging, genetics, clinical, and phenotypic data
   and meta-data. Data mining refers to the process of automatically
   extracting data features, characteristics and associations, which are
   not readily visible by human exploration of the raw dataset. Result
   interpretation includes scientific visualization, community validation
   of findings and reproducible findings. In this manuscript we describe
   the novel high-throughput neuroimaging-genetics computational
   infrastructure available at the Institute for Neuroimaging and
   Informatics (INI) and the Laboratory of Neuro Imaging (LONI) at
   University of Southern California (USC). INI and LONI include
   ultra-high-field and standard-field MRI brain scanners along with an
   imaging-genetics database for storing the complete provenance of the raw
   and derived data and meta-data. In addition, the institute provides a
   large number of software tools for image and shape analysis,
   mathematical modeling, genomic sequence processing, and scientific
   visualization. A unique feature of this architecture is the Pipeline
   environment, which integrates the data management, processing, transfer,
   and visualization. Through its client-server architecture, the Pipeline
   environment provides a graphical user interface for designing,
   executing, monitoring validating, and disseminating of complex protocols
   that utilize diverse suites of software tools and web-services. These
   pipeline workflows are represented as portable XML objects which
   transfer the execution instructions and user specifications from the
   client user machine to remote pipeline servers for distributed
   computing. Using Alzheimer's and Parkinson's data, we provide several
   examples of translational applications using this infrastructure(1).}},

Abstract = {{Increasing evidence suggests that synaptic dysfunction is a core
   pathophysiological hallmark of neurodegenerative disorders.
   Brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) is key synaptogenic molecule and
   targeting synaptic repair through modulation of BDNF signalling has been
   suggested as a potential drug discovery strategy. The development of
   such ``synaptogenic'' therapies depend on the availability of BDNF
   sensitive markers of synaptic function that could be utilized as
   biomarkers for examining target engagement or drug efficacy in humans.
   Here we have utilized the BDNF Val66Met genetic polymorphism to examine
   the effect of the polymorphism and genetic load (i.e. Met allele load)
   on electrophysiological (EEG) markers of synaptic activity and their
   structural (MRI) correlates. Sixty healthy adults were prospectively
   recruited into the three genetic groups (Val/Val, Val/Met, Met/Met).
   Subjects also underwent fMRI, tDCS/TMS, and cognitive assessments as
   part of a larger study. Overall, some of the EEG markers of synaptic
   activity and brain structure measured with MRI were the most sensitive
   markers of the polymorphism. Met carriers showed decreased oscillatory
   activity and synchrony in the neural network subserving
   error-processing, as measured during a flanker task (ERN); and showed
   increased slow-wave activity during resting. There was no evidence for a
   Met load effect on the EEG measures and the polymorphism had no effects
   on MMN and P300. Met carriers also showed reduced grey matter volume in
   the anterior cingulate and in the (left) prefrontal cortex. Furthermore,
   anterior cingulate grey matter volume, and oscillatory EEG power during
   the flanker task predicted subsequent behavioural adaptation, indicating
   a BDNF dependent link between brain structure, function and behaviour
   associated with error processing and monitoring. These findings suggest
   that EEG markers such as ERN and resting EEG could be used as BDNF
   sensitive functional markers in early clinical development to examine
   target engagement or drug related efficacy of synaptic repair therapies
   in humans.}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging is often difficult to distinguish from the earliest stages
   of Alzheimer's disease. Years before clinical memory deficits manifest,
   amyloid-beta deposits in the cortex in many older individuals.
   Neuroimaging studies indicate that a set of densely connected
   neocortical regions, referred to as the default network, is especially
   vulnerable to amyloid-beta deposition. Yet, the impact of amyloid-beta
   on age-related changes within the medial temporal lobe (MTL) memory
   system is less clear. Here we demonstrate that cognitively normal older
   humans, compared with young adults, show reduced ability to modulate
   hippocampal activations and entorhinal deactivations during an episodic
   memory task. Among older adults, amyloid-beta deposition was associated
   with failure to modulate activity in entorhinal cortex, but not
   hippocampus. Furthermore, we show that entorhinal regions demonstrating
   amyloid-beta-related dysfunction are directly connected to the
   neocortical regions of the default network. Together these findings link
   neocortical amyloid-beta deposition to neuronal dysfunction specifically
   in entorhinal cortex, while aging is associated with more widespread
   functional changes across the MTL.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered the main cause of dementia in
   Western countries. Consequently, there is a need for an accurate,
   universal, specific and cost-effective biomarker for early AD diagnosis,
   to follow disease progression and therapy response. This article
   describes a new diagnostic approach to quantitative electroencephalogram
   (QEEG) diagnosis of mild and moderate AD. The data set used in this
   study was composed of EEG signals recorded from 2 groups: (S1) 74 normal
   subjects, 33 females and 41 males (mean age 67 years, standard deviation
   = 8) and (S2) 88 probable AD patients (NINCDS-ADRDA criteria), 55
   females and 33 males (mean age 74.7 years, standard deviation = 7.8)
   with mild to moderate symptoms (DSM-IV-TR). Attention is given to sample
   size and the use of state of the art open source tools (LetsWave and
   WEKA) to process the EEG data. This innovative technique consists in
   associating Morlet wavelet filter with a support vector machine
   technique. A total of 111 EEG features (attributes) were obtained for
   162 probands. The results were accuracy of 92.72\% and area under the
   curve of 0.92 (percentage split test). Most important, comparing a
   single patient versus the total data set resulted in accuracy of 84.56\%
   (leave-one-patient-out test). Particular emphasis was on clinical
   diagnosis and feasibility of implementation of this low-cost procedure,
   because programming knowledge is not required. Consequently, this new
   method can be useful to support AD diagnosis in resource-limited
   settings.}},

Abstract = {{The brain functions as a spatio-temporal information processing machine.
   Spatio- and spectra-temporal brain data (STBD) are the most commonly
   collected data for measuring brain response to external stimuli. An
   enormous amount of such data has been already collected, including brain
   structural and functional data under different conditions, molecular and
   genetic data, in an attempt to make a progress in medicine, health,
   cognitive science, engineering, education, neuro-economics,
   Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), and games. Yet, there is no unifying
   computational framework to deal with all these types of data in order to
   better understand this data and the processes that generated it.
   Standard machine learning techniques only partially succeeded and they
   were not designed in the first instance to deal with such complex data.
   Therefore, there is a need for a new paradigm to deal with STBD. This
   paper reviews some methods of spiking neural networks (SNN) and argues
   that SNN are suitable for the creation of a unifying computational
   framework for learning and understanding of various STBD, such as EEG,
   fMRI, genetic, DTI, MEG, and NIRS, in their integration and interaction.
   One of the reasons is that SNN use the same computational principle that
   generates STBD, namely spiking information processing. This paper
   introduces a new SNN architecture, called NeuCube, for the creation of
   concrete models to map, learn and understand STBD. A NeuCube model is
   based on a 3D evolving SNN that is an approximate map of structural and
   functional areas of interest of the brain related to the modeling STBD.
   Gene information is included optionally in the form of gene regulatory
   networks (GRN) if this is relevant to the problem and the data. A
   NeuCube model learns from STBD and creates connections between clusters
   of neurons that manifest chains (trajectories) of neuronal activity.
   Once learning is applied, a NeuCube model can reproduce these
   trajectories, even if only part of the input STBD or the stimuli data is
   presented, thus acting as an associative memory. The NeuCube framework
   can be used not only to discover functional pathways from data, but also
   as a predictive system of brain activities, to predict and possibly,
   prevent certain events. Analysis of the internal structure of a model
   after training can reveal important spatio-temporal relationships
   `hidden' in the data. NeuCube will allow the integration in one model of
   various brain data, information and knowledge, related to a single
   subject (personalized modeling) or to a population of subjects. The use
   of NeuCube for classification of STBD is illustrated in a case study
   problem of EEG data. NeuCube models result in a better accuracy of STBD
   classification than standard machine learning techniques. They are
   robust to noise (so typical in brain data) and facilitate a better
   interpretation of the results and understanding of the STBD and the
   brain conditions under which data was collected. Future directions for
   the use of SNN for STBD are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {{Alzheimer disease (AD), the most common form of dementia reduces the
   brain cell growth and leads to brain death. Worldwide, nearly 35.6
   million people are believed to be living with Alzheimer's disease or
   other dementias. Analyzing the electrical brain signal in its earlier
   stage would prevent the death rate. Due to its high complexity and
   non-stationary property, large amount of noise is present with signal.
   To recover this, several denoising methods are used. In our method,
   complex wavelet based denoising is preferred which provides information
   both in time and frequency domain. Of the different threshold selection
   methods, Shannon entropy based threshold selection has been used. By
   this method, higher SNR and lower RMSE values of about 18.25 and 0.5 are
   obtained. Features such as sample entropy, power spectral density and
   standard deviation are used to train the neural network for achieving
   the classification of AD from normal EEG. In this article, a specificity

Abstract = {{The majority of brain activities are performed by functionally
   integrating separate regions of the brain. Therefore, the synchronous
   operation of the brain's multiple regions or neuronal assemblies can be
   represented as a network with nodes that are interconnected by links.
   Because of the complexity of brain interactions and their varying
   effects at different levels of complexity, one of the corresponding
   authors of this paper recently proposed the brainnetome as a new -ome to
   explore and integrate the brain network at different scales. Because
   electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) are
   noninvasive and have outstanding temporal resolution and because they
   are the primary clinical techniques used to capture the dynamics of
   neuronal connections, they lend themselves to the analysis of the neural
   networks comprising the brainnetome. Because of EEG/MEG's applicability
   to brainnetome analyses, the aim of this review is to identify the
   procedures that can be used to form a network using EEG/MEG data in
   sensor or source space and to promote EEG/MEG network analysis for
   either neuroscience or clinical applications. To accomplish this aim, we
   show the relationship of the brainnetome to brain networks at the
   macroscale and provide a systematic review of network construction using
   EEG and MEG. Some potential applications of the EEG/MEG brainnetome are
   to use newly developed methods to associate the properties of a
   brainnetome with indices of cognition or disease conditions.
   Associations based on EEG/MEG brainnetome analysis may improve the
   comprehension of the functioning of the brain in neuroscience research
   or the recognition of abnormal patterns in neurological disease.}},

Abstract = {{The primary brain image segmentation goal is to partition a given brain
   image into different regions representing anatomical structures.
   Magnetic resonance image (MRI) segmentation is especially interesting
   because the accurate representation of white matter, grey matter and
   cerebrospinal fluid provides a way to identify many brain disorders,
   such as dementia, schizophrenia or Alzheimer's disease (AD). This paper
   presents a fully unsupervised method for MRI segmentation based on
   Self-Organising Maps (SOMs) and Genetic Algorithms (GAs). In particular,
   the proposed method is based on five stages consisting of image
   acquisition, feature extraction, feature selection using evolutionary
   computation, voxel classification using SOM, and sharp map clustering.
   Moreover, a novel SOM clustering mechanism is presented that defines
   cluster borders by considering the output space and the relationship
   with the input space. This clustering mechanism accommodates spatial
   relationships using an entropy-gradient (EG) function calculation to
   group the units on the output space (SOM). The complete procedure does
   not use any a priori knowledge regarding voxel class assignment, but
   reveals a fully unsupervised, automated method for MRI segmentation to
   directly identify different tissue classes. Our algorithm was tested
   using images from the Internet Brain Image Repository (IBSR),
   outperforming the CGMM method in WM and CSF delineation, and was found
   to be the most effective among other techniques. Furthermore, this
   method provided excellent results using high-resolution MR images
   provided by the Nuclear Medicine Service of the ``Virgen de las
   Nieves{''} Hospital (Granada, Spain). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights

Title = {{Brain Activity and Functional Coupling Changes Associated with
   Self-Reference Effect during Both Encoding and Retrieval}},
Journal = {{PLOS ONE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{9}},
Number = {{3}},
Month = {{MAR 7}},
Abstract = {{Information that is processed with reference to oneself, i.e.
   Self-Referential Processing (SRP), is generally associated with better
   remembering compared to information processed in a condition not related
   to oneself. This positive effect of the self on subsequent memory
   performance is called as Self-Reference Effect (SRE). The neural basis
   of SRE is still poorly understood. The main goal of the present work was
   thus to highlight brain changes associated with SRE in terms of activity
   and functional coupling and during both encoding and retrieval so as to
   assess the relative contribution of both processes to SRE. For this
   purpose, we used an fMRI event-related self-referential paradigm in 30
   healthy young subjects and measured brain activity during both encoding
   and retrieval of self-relevant information compared to a semantic
   control condition. We found that SRE was associated with brain changes
   during the encoding phase only, including both greater activity in the
   medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, and greater functional
   coupling between these brain regions and the posterior cingulate cortex.
   These findings highlight the contribution of brain regions involved in
   both SRP and episodic memory and the relevance of the communication
   between these regions during the encoding process as the neural
   substrates of SRE. This is consistent with the idea that SRE reflects a
   positive effect of the reactivation of self-related memories on the
   encoding of new information in episodic memory.}},

Journal = {{FRONTIERS IN CELLULAR NEUROSCIENCE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{8}},
Month = {{MAR 4}},
Abstract = {{Human functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have long
   investigated the hippocampus without differentiating between its
   subfields, even though theoretical models and rodent studies suggest
   that subfields support different and potentially even opposite
   functions. The CA3 region of the hippocampus has been ascribed a pivotal
   role both in initially forming associations during encoding and in
   reconstructing a memory representation based on partial cues during
   retrieval. These functions have been related to pattern separation and
   pattern completion, respectively. In recent years, studies using
   high-resolution fMRI in humans have begun to separate different
   hippocampal subregions and identify the role of the CA3 subregion
   relative to the other subregions. However, some of these findings have
   been inconsistent with theoretical models and findings from
   electrophysiology. In this review, we describe selected recent studies
   and highlight how their results might help to define different processes
   and functions that are presumably carried out by the CA3 region, in
   particular regarding the seemingly opposing functions of pattern
   separation and pattern completion. We also describe how these
   subfield-specific processes are related to behavioral, functional and
   structural alterations in patients with mild cognitive impairment and
   Alzheimer's disease. We conclude with discussing limitations of
   functional imaging and briefly outline possible future developments of
   the field.}},

Abstract = {{We hypothesized that semantic memory for object concepts involves both
   representations of visual feature knowledge in modality-specific
   association cortex and heteromodal regions that are important for
   integrating and organizing this semantic knowledge so that it can be
   used in a flexible, contextually appropriate manner. We examined this
   hypothesis in an fMRI study of mild Alzheimer's disease (AD).
   Participants were presented with pairs of printed words and asked
   whether the words matched on a given visual-perceptual feature (e.g.,
   guitar, violin: SHAPE). The stimuli probed natural kinds and
   manufactured objects, and the judgments involved shape or color. We
   found activation of bilateral ventral temporal cortex and left
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during semantic judgments, with AD
   patients showing less activation of these regions than healthy seniors.
   Moreover, AD patients showed less ventral temporal activation than did
   healthy seniors for manufactured objects, but not for natural kinds. We
   also used diffusion-weighted MRI of white matter to examine fractional
   anisotropy (FA). Patients with AD showed significantly reduced FA in the
   superior longitudinal fasciculus and inferior frontal-occipital
   fasciculus, which carry projections linking temporal and frontal regions
   of this semantic network. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis
   that semantic memory is supported in part by a large-scale neural
   network involving modality-specific association cortex, heteromodal
   association cortex, and projections between these regions. The semantic
   deficit in AD thus arises from gray matter disease that affects the
   representation of feature knowledge and processing its content, as well
   as white matter disease that interrupts the integrated functioning of
   this large-scale network.}},

Journal = {{BRAIN}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{137}},
Number = {{3}},
Pages = {{849-859}},
Month = {{MAR}},
Abstract = {{Visual hallucinations are frequent, disabling complications of advanced
   Parkinson's disease, but their neuroanatomical basis is incompletely
   understood. Previous structural brain magnetic resonance imaging studies
   suggest volume loss in the mesial temporal lobe and limbic regions in
   subjects with Parkinson's disease with visual hallucinations, relative
   to those without visual hallucinations. However, these studies have not
   always controlled for the presence of cognitive impairment or dementia,
   which are common co-morbidities of hallucinations in Parkinson's disease
   and whose neuroanatomical substrates may involve mesial temporal lobe
   and limbic regions. Therefore, we used structural magnetic resonance
   imaging to examine grey matter atrophy patterns associated with visual
   hallucinations, comparing Parkinson's disease hallucinators to
   Parkinson's disease non-hallucinators of comparable cognitive function.
   We studied 50 subjects with Parkinson's disease: 25 classified as
   current and chronic visual hallucinators and 25 as non-hallucinators,
   who were matched for cognitive status (demented or non-demented) and age
   (+/- 3 years). Subjects underwent (i) clinical evaluations; and (ii)
   brain MRI scans analysed using whole-brain voxel-based morphometry
   techniques. Clinically, the Parkinson's disease hallucinators did not
   differ in their cognitive classification or performance in any of the
   five assessed cognitive domains, compared with the non-hallucinators.
   The Parkinson's disease groups also did not differ significantly in age,
   motor severity, medication use or duration of disease. On imaging
   analyses, the hallucinators, all of whom experienced visual
   hallucinations, exhibited grey matter atrophy with significant
   voxel-wise differences in the cuneus, lingual and fusiform gyri, middle
   occipital lobe, inferior parietal lobule, and also cingulate,
   paracentral, and precentral gyri, compared with the non-hallucinators.
   Grey matter atrophy in the hallucinators occurred predominantly in brain
   regions responsible for processing visuoperceptual information including
   the ventral `what' and dorsal `where' pathways, which are important in
   object and facial recognition and identification of spatial locations of
   objects, respectively. Furthermore, the structural brain changes seen on
   magnetic resonance imaging occurred independently of cognitive function
   and age. Our findings suggest that when hallucinators and
   non-hallucinators are similar in their cognitive performance, the neural
   networks involving visuoperceptual pathways, rather than the mesial
   temporal lobe regions, distinctively contribute to the pathophysiology
   of visual hallucinations and may explain their predominantly visual
   nature in Parkinson's disease. Identification of distinct structural MRI
   differences associated with hallucinations in Parkinson's disease may
   permit earlier detection of at-risk patients and ultimately, development
   of therapies specifically targeting hallucinations and visuoperceptive
   functions.}},

Abstract = {{In recent years, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has attracted
   significant attention as an indicator of high risk for Alzheimer's
   disease (AD), and the diagnosis of MCI can alert patient to carry out
   appropriate strategies to prevent AD. To avoid subjectivity in

   is an automated procedure for diagnosing MCI through magnetic resonance
   imaging (MRI). In this approach, we encode specialized MRI knowledge
   into an ontology and construct a rule set using machine learning
   algorithms. Then we apply these two parts in conjunction with reasoning
   engine to automatically distinguish MCI patients from normal controls
   (NC). The rule set is trained by MRI data of 187 MCI patients and 177
   normal controls selected from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative (ADNI) using C4.5 algorithm. By using a 10-fold cross
   validation, we prove that the performance of C4.5 with 80.2\%
   sensitivity is better than other algorithms, such as support vector
   machine (SVM), Bayesian network (BN) and back propagation (BP) neural
   networks, and C4.5 is suitable for the construction of reasoning rules.

Abstract = {{Old age could impair memory by disrupting learning strategies used by

   controlled visual exploration during active learning, thus permitting
   the use of strategies, whereas strategies were limited during passive

   object recognition and object-location recall was matched for younger
   and older subjects for objects studied passively, when learning
   strategies were restricted. Active learning improved object recognition
   similarly for younger and older subjects. However, active learning
   improved object-location recall for younger subjects, but not older

   involving repeat viewing. Older subjects used this strategy less
   frequently and it provided less memory benefit compared to younger
   subjects. In previous experiments, we linked hippocampal-prefrontal
   co-activation to improvements in object-location recall from active

Abstract = {{In human cognition, self and memory processes strongly interact, as
   evidenced by the memory advantage for self-referential materials
   {[}Self-Reference Effect (SRE) and Self-Reference Recollection Effect
   (SRRE)]. The current study examined this interaction at the behavioural
   level and its neural correlates in patients with Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed
   trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for
   other-relevance (encoding phase). In a first experiment, the encoding
   and subsequent yes no recognition phases were administrated in a
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanner. Brain activation as measured
   by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined during self-relevance judgements
   and anatomical images were used to search for correlation between the
   memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter density (GMD).
   In a second experiment, participants described the retrieval experience
   that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs recollective
   experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SEE and SRRE were
   impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore, verbal
   reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was
   preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details, such
   as source memory in the HC participants, but less so in the AD patients.
   Our imaging findings revealed that both groups activated the medial
   prefrontal cortex (MPFC) at encoding during self-relevance judgements.
   However, the variable and limited memory advantage for self-related
   information was associated with GMD in the lateral prefrontal cortex in
   the AD patients, a region supporting high-order processes linking self
   and memory. These findings suggest that even if AD patients engage MPFC
   during self-referential judgements, the retrieval of self-related
   memories is qualitatively and quantitatively impaired in relation with
   altered high-order processes in the lateral PFC. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {{Introduction: Resting-state EEG microstates are thought to reflect the
   momentary local states and interactions of distributed neural networks
   in the brain. Several changes in resting-state EEG microstates have been
   described in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia, but it is not
   known whether these represent trait or state abnormalities. The present
   study aimed to investigate this issue by assessing EEG microstate
   characteristics in high-risk individuals (HR) and clinically stable
   first-episode patients with schizophrenia (SZ) with low symptom levels,
   compared to each other and healthy controls (HC).
   Method: Participants were 18 HR, 18 SZ, and 22 HC subjects. 64-channel
   resting-state EEG recordings were used for microstate analyses.
   Microstates were clustered into four classes (A-D) according to their
   topography. Temporal parameters and topographies of microstates were
   compared among groups.
   Results: Microstate class A displayed higher coverage and occurrence in
   HR than SZ and HC, while microstate class B covered significantly more
   time in SZ compared to both HR and HC. Microstate class B displayed an
   aberrant spatial configuration in SZ, and to a lesser extent also in HR,
   compared to HC, with patients exhibiting significantly higher activity
   in the vicinity of the left posterior cingulate.
   Discussion: Microstate abnormalities observed in HR were similar to
   those previously reported in acutely ill patients with schizophrenia.
   Moreover, there was evidence that HR and SZ might share specific
   disturbances in brain functional connectivity. These findings raise the
   possibility that certain abnormalities in resting-state EEG microstates
   might be associated with an increased risk for psychosis. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Reduced NMDA receptor functioning is hypothesized to underlie the
   cognitive and negative symptoms associated with schizophrenia. However,
   because direct activation of the NMDA receptor is accompanied by
   neurotoxicity, mechanisms that activate the glycine co-agonist site on
   the NMDA receptor could carry greater therapeutic potential. In the
   current study, the effects of two glycine transporter 1 (GlyT1)
   inhibitors, RG1678 and ORG25935, were characterized in the
   object-retrieval detour (ORD) task in scopolamine-impaired rhesus
   monkeys and, using positron emission tomography (PET), the GlyT1
   occupancy to efficacy relationship of each compound was established.
   Scopolamine exerted a significant decrease in accuracy in the ORD task.
   Lower doses of RG1678 (0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, p.o.) significantly attenuated
   the impact of scopolamine, whereas the highest dose tested (1.8 mg/kg)
   did not. The predicted GlyT1 occupancies of RG1678 at the effective
   doses were similar to 10 and 30 \%. ORG25935 (0.1, 0.3, and 1 mg/kg,
   p.o.) also significantly attenuated the impact of scopolamine on the ORD
   task, whereas 3 mg/kg did not. The predicted GlyT1 occupancies of
   ORG25935 at the effective doses ranged from 16 to 80 \%. These data
   suggest that GlyT1 inhibitors have the potential to improve performance
   on prefrontal cortex-dependent tests such as the ORD task, but that
   efficacy is lost when higher occupancies are achieved. Importantly,
   recent Ph2B data published by Roche suggests that low but not high doses
   of RG1678 improved negative symptoms in patients with schizophrenia,
   highlighting the potential translational nature of the current
   preclinical findings.}},

Abstract = {{Two main issues for event-related potential (ERP) classification in
   brain-computer interface (BCI) application are curse-of-dimensionality
   and bias-variance tradeoff, which may deteriorate classification
   performance, especially with insufficient training samples resulted from
   limited calibration time. This study introduces an aggregation of sparse
   linear discriminant analyses (ASLDA) to overcome these problems. In the
   ASLDA, multiple sparse discriminant vectors are learned from differently
   l(1)-regularized least-squares regressions by exploiting the equivalence
   between LDA and least-squares regression, and are subsequently
   aggregated to form an ensemble classifier, which could not only
   implement automatic feature selection for dimensionality reduction to
   alleviate curse-of-dimensionality, but also decrease the variance to
   improve generalization capacity for new test samples. Extensive
   investigation and comparison are carried out among the ASLDA, the
   ordinary LDA and other competing ERP classification algorithms, based on
   different three ERP datasets. Experimental results indicate that the
   ASLDA yields better overall performance for single-trial ERP
   classification when insufficient training samples are available. This
   suggests the proposed ASLDA is promising for ERP classification in small
   sample size scenario to improve the practicability of BCI.}},

Abstract = {{Efforts to understand the functional architecture of the brain have
   consistently identified multiple overlapping large-scale neural networks
   that are observable across multiple states. Despite the ubiquity of
   these networks, it remains unclear how regions within these large-scale
   neural networks interact to orchestrate behavior. Here, we collected
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 188 human subjects who
   engaged in three cognitive tasks and a resting-state scan. Using
   multiple tasks and a large sample allowed us to use split-sample
   validations to test for replication of results. We parceled the
   task-rest pairs into functional networks using a probabilistic spatial
   independent components analysis. We examined changes in connectivity
   between task and rest states using dual-regression analysis, which
   quantifies voxelwise connectivity estimates for each network of interest
   while controlling for the influence of signals arising from other
   networks and artifacts. Our analyses revealed systematic state-dependent
   functional connectivity in one brain region: the precuneus.
   Specifically, task performance led to increased connectivity (compared
   with rest) between the precuneus and the right frontoparietal network,
   whereas rest increased connectivity between the precuneus and the
   default-mode network (DMN). The absolute magnitude of this effect was
   greater for DMN, suggesting a heightened specialization for
   resting-state cognition. All results replicated within the two
   independent samples. Our results indicate that the precuneus plays a
   core role not only in DMN, but also more broadly through its engagement
   under a variety of processing states.}},

Abstract = {{the human brain consists of many different neural elements that comprise
   a functioning processing and control system. Though each area has its
   unique role, they do not operate separately. It is empirically known
   that during brain activity, different elements affect each other. Such
   neural network's activity is called Functional Brain Connectivity (FBC).
   It is a known phenomenon among athletes who suffer mild head injuries
   frequently along their career, to be more likely to suffer from
   neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's at old
   age. This phenomenon has been studied by physicians and health
   researchers as early as 1971 {[}1]. Patients who suffered from frequent
   mild head injuries have no neurological appearable symptoms at young
   age. FBC abnormality accompanies the mentioned neurological diseases,
   each characterizes with a different pattern {[}2], {[}3]. These two
   facts led the hypothesis that frequent head injuries can, with some
   probability, cause FBC abnormalities. Proving this hypothesis and
   mapping the transformed pattern of FBC can contribute to understanding
   neurological diseases and by this help the search after treatment
   generally and preventing for frequent mild injured athletes
   particularly.
   This work offers a technology that enables brain researchers to evaluate
   and locate abnormalities in FBC using fMRI data of a patient. It does so
   using the fact that connectivity pattern, at rest state, is to a large
   extent symmetrical. The system evaluates connectivity between classes of
   voxels using a new nonlinear - Differential Filtered Coherence. It is a
   mathematical solution for describing connections that are not necessary
   linear by following the influences of changes in one signal on the
   changes in another.
   Finally, the system finds FBC asymmetry using registration of the
   generated connectivity map between the two hemispheres of the brain.}},

Abstract = {{Accurate classification of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal
   stage, Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in
   preventing progression of memory impairment and improving quality of
   life for AD patients. Among many research tasks, it is of particular
   interest to identify noninvasive imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In
   this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify
   different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans.
   We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by
   preventing its weight co-adaptation, which is a typical cause of
   overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability
   selection, an adaptive learning factor and a multi-task learning
   strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed
   method to the ADNI data set and conducted experiments for AD and MCI
   conversion diagnosis. Experimental results showed that the dropout
   technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving the
   classification accuracies by 6.2\% on average as compared to classical
   deep learning methods.}},

Abstract = {{Content-Based Visual Information Retrieval (CBVIR) methods applieds to
   Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) are penetrating the universe of IT
   tools for clinical decision support. A clinician can take profit from
   retrieving subjects' scans with similar patterns. The CBVIR approach has
   been used since recently for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The
   most explored imaging modality in this context is the structural MRI.
   The Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively recent technique and
   CBVIR approaches have not yet been developed on it. The combination of
   several MRI modalities improves the performances of CBVIR methods, but
   first of all it is necessary to explore the ability of DTI modality to
   give a correct answer alone. The present work is amongst the earliest
   attempts to use visual features as in a generic CBVIR, on this modality
   for AD research. The proposed approach is based on the comparison of
   visual features extracted from the hippocampal area. We use the Circular
   Harmonic Functions (CHFs) to describe the content of the Diffusion
   Tensor-derived map: Mean Diffusivity (MD). This study was first
   accomplished with a subset of participants from the Alzheimer's Disease

   network connectivity in amnestic mild cognitive impairment}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{4}},
Pages = {{473-480}},
Abstract = {{Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is believed to represent a
   transitional stage between normal healthy ageing and the development of
   dementia. In particular, aMCI patients have been shown to have higher
   annual transition rates to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) than individuals
   without cognitive impairment. Despite intensifying interest
   investigating the neuroanatomical basis of this transition, there remain
   a number of questions regarding the pathophysiological process
   underlying aMCI itself. A number of recent studies in aMCI have shown
   specific impairments in connectivity within the default mode network
   (DMN), which is a group of regions strongly related to episodic memory
   capacities. However to date, no study has investigated the integrity of
   the DMN between patients with aMCI and those with a non-amnestic pattern
   of MCI (naMCI), who have cognitive impairment, but intact memory storage
   systems. In this study, we contrasted the DMN connectivity in 24 aMCI
   and 33 naMCI patients using seed-based resting state fMRI. The two
   groups showed no statistical difference in their DMN intra-connectivity.
   However when connectivity was analysed according to performance on
   measures of episodic memory retrieval, the two groups were separable,
   with aMCI patients demonstrating impaired functional connectivity
   between the hippocampal formation and the posterior cingulate cortex. We
   provide evidence that this lack of connectivity is driven by impaired
   communication from the posterior cingulate hub and does not simply
   represent hippocampal atrophy, suggesting that posterior cingulate
   degeneration is the driving force behind impaired DMN connectivity in
   aMCI. (C) 2014 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.}},

Abstract = {{Since the Brain Order Disorder (BOD) group reported on a high density
   Electroencephalogram (EEG) to capture the neuronal information using EEG
   to wirelessly interface with a Smartphone {[}1,2], a larger BOD group
   has been assembled, including the Obama BRAIN program, CUA Brain
   Computer Interface Lab and the UCSD Swartz Computational Neuroscience
   Center. We can implement the pair-electrodes correlation functions in
   order to operate in a real time daily environment, which is of the
   computation complexity of O(N-3) for N=10(2 similar to 3) known as
   functional f-EEG. The daily monitoring requires two areas of focus. Area
   \#(1) to quantify the neuronal information flow under arbitrary daily
   stimuli-response sources. Approach to \#1: (i) We have asserted that the
   sources contained in the EEG signals may be discovered by an
   unsupervised learning neural network called blind sources separation
   (BSS) of independent entropy components, based on the irreversible
   Boltzmann cellular thermodynamics(Delta S > 0), where the entropy is a
   degree of uniformity. What is the entropy? Loosely speaking, sand on the
   beach is more uniform at a higher entropy value than the rocks composing
   a mountain - the internal binding energy tells the paleontologists the
   existence of information. To a politician, landside voting results has
   only the winning information but more entropy, while a non-uniform
   voting distribution record has more information. For the human's
   effortless brain at constant temperature, we can solve the minimum of
   Helmholtz free energy (H = E - TS) by computing BSS, and then their
   pairwise-entropy source correlation function. (i) Although the entropy
   itself is not the information per se, but the concurrence of the entropy
   sources is the information flow as a functional-EEG, sketched in this
   2nd BOD report. Area \#(2) applying EEG bio-feedback will improve
   collective decision making (TBD). Approach to \#2: We introduce a novel
   performance quality metrics, in terms of the throughput rate of faster
   (At) \& more accurate (AA) decision making, which applies to individual,
   as well as team brain dynamics Following Nobel Laureate Daniel Kahnmen's
   novel ``Thinking fast and slow{''}, through the brainwave biofeedback we
   can first identify an individual's ``anchored cognitive bias
   sources{''}. This is done in order to remove the biases by means of
   individually tailored pre-processing. Then the training effectiveness
   can be maximized by the collective product Delta t {*} AA. For Area
   (sic)1, we compute a spatiotemporally windowed EEG in vitro average
   using adaptive time-window sampling The sampling rate depends on the
   type of neuronal responses, which is what we seek. The averaged
   traditional EEG measurements and are further improved by BSS
   decomposition into finer stimulus-response source mixing matrix {[}A]
   having finer \& faster spatial grids with rapid temporal updates. Then,
   the functional EEG is the second order co-variance matrix defined as the
   electrode-pair fluctuation correlation function C((S) over tilde,(S)
   over tilde') of independent thermodynamic source components. (1) We
   define a 1-D Space filling curve as a spiral curve without origin. This
   pattern is historically known as the Peano-Hilbert arc length a. By
   taking the most significant bits of the Cartesian product a E O(x {*} y
   {*} z), it represents the arc length in the numerical size with values
   that map the 3-D neighborhood proximity into a 1-D neighborhood arc
   length representation.
   (2) 1-D Fourier coefficients spectrum have no spurious high frequency
   contents, which typically arise in lexicographical (zig-zag scanning)
   discontinuity {[}Hsu \& Szu, ``Peano-Hilbert curve,{''} SPIE 20141. A
   simple Fourier spectrum histogram fits nicely with the Compressive
   Sensing CRDT Mathematics. (3) Stationary power spectral density is a
   reasonable approximation of EEG responses in striate layers in resonance
   feedback loops capable of producing a 100, 000 neuronal collective
   Impulse Response Function (IRT). The striate brain layer architecture
   represents an ensemble <IRF> e.g. at V1-V4 of Brodmann areas 17-19 of
   the Cortex, i.e. stationary Wiener-Kintchine-Einstein Theorem. Goal 1:
   functional-EEG: After taking the 1-D space-filling curve, we compute the
   ensemble averaged 1-D Power Spectral Density (PSD) and then make use of
   the inverse FFT to generate f-EEG. (ii) Goal\#2 individual wellness
   baseline (IWB): We need novel change detection, so we derive the
   ubiquitous fat-tail distributions for healthy brains PSD in outdoor
   environments (Signal=310 C; Noise=27 C: 5NR=310/300; 300 K=(1/40)eV).
   The departure from IWB might imply stress, fever, a sports injury, an
   unexpected fall, or numerous midnight excursions which may signal an
   onset of dementia in Home Alone Senior (HAS), discovered by telemedicine

Abstract = {{Purpose: {[}F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging of the brain can
   be used to assist in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Group
   differences in glucose uptake between patients with dementia and
   controls are well-known. However, a multivariate analysis technique
   called scaled subprofile model, principal component analysis (SSM/PCA)
   aiming at identifying diagnostic neural networks in diseases, have been
   applied less frequently. We validated an Alzheimer's Disease-related
   (AD) glucose metabolic brain pattern using the SSM/PCA analysis and
   applied it prospectively in an independent confirmation cohort. Methods:
   We used FDG-PET scans of 18 healthy controls and 15 AD patients
   (identification cohort) to identify an AD-related glucose metabolic
   covariance pattern. In the confirmation cohort (n=15), we investigated
   the ability to discriminate between probable AD and non-probable AD
   (possible AD, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or subjective complaints).
   Results: The AD-related metabolic covariance pattern was characterized
   by relatively decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal regions and
   relatively increased metabolism in the subcortical white matter,
   cerebellum and sensorimotor cortex. Receiver-operating characteristic
   (ROC) curves showed at a cut-off value of z=1.23, a sensitivity of 93\%
   and a specificity of 94\% for correct AD classification. In the
   confirmation cohort, subjects with clinically probable AD diagnosis
   showed a high expression of the AD-related pattern whereas in subjects
   with a non-probable AD diagnosis a low expression was found. Conclusion:
   The Alzheimer's disease-related cerebral glucose metabolic covariance
   pattern identified by SSM/PCA analysis was highly sensitive and specific
   for Alzheimer's disease. This method is expected to be helpful in the
   early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Alzheimer's disease (AD) clinical onset is usually
   characterized by a memory complaint and a progressive memory deficit.
   The proportion of typical medial-temporal amnesia revealing AD remains
   unknown.
   Objective: The present study explores the episodic memory impairment
   profiles by the Free and Cued Selective Recall Reminding Test (FCSRT) in
   patients with initial memory complaint and a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
   biomarker signature of AD.
   Methods: Seventy-three patients referred for memory complaint to the
   Centers for Memory, Resource and Research of Lyon and Montpellier
   (France) were included consecutively. All patients underwent an
   extensive neuropsychological examination and had a Mini-Mental State
   Examination (MMSE) score >= 20 and a positive CSF AD signature. The
   patients were classified as having mild dementia or prodromal AD. Verbal
   episodic memory was assessed using the French version of the FCSRT
   exploring encoding, storage/consolidation, and cued delayed retrieval
   phases of memorization. Three different memory profiles were identified
   according to the results of FCSRT.
   Results: The median age was 72 year-old {[}interquartiles: 65-76]. The
   median MMSE score was 23 {[}interquartiles: 21-25]. 88\% of the patients
   (n = 64) presented with a medial temporal amnesia profile. The
   dysexecutive amnesia and normal verbal episodic memory profiles
   represented respectively 5\% (n = 4) and 7\% (n = 5). There were no
   significant differences in term of age, gender, and MMSE score between
   the three profile groups.
   Conclusion: In a population initially presenting with memory complaints
   and depicting a CSF AD signature, a high proportion of medial temporal
   amnesia is disclosed as expected, but also a proportion of dysexecutive
   amnesia and normal FCSRT.}},

Abstract = {{Depression is closely linked to the morphology and functional
   abnormalities of multiple brain regions; however, its topological
   structure throughout the whole brain remains unclear. We collected
   resting-state functional MRI data from 36 first-onset unmedicated
   depression patients and 27 healthy controls. The resting-state
   functional connectivity was constructed using the Automated Anatomical
   Labeling template with a partial correlation method. The metrics
   calculation and statistical analysis were performed using complex
   network theory. The results showed that both depressive patients and
   healthy controls presented typical small-world attributes. Compared with
   healthy controls, characteristic path length was significantly shorter
   in depressive patients, suggesting development toward randomization.
   Patients with depression showed apparently abnormal node attributes at
   key areas in cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuits. In addition,
   right hippocampus and right thalamus were closely linked with the
   severity of depression. We selected 270 local attributes as the
   classification features and their P values were regarded as criteria for
   statistically significant differences. An artificial neural network
   algorithm was applied for classification research. The results showed
   that brain network metrics could be used as an effective feature in
   machine learning research, which brings about a reasonable application
   prospect for brain network metrics. The present study also highlighted a
   significant positive correlation between the importance of the
   attributes and the intergroup differences; that is, the more significant
   the differences in node attributes, the stronger their contribution to
   the classification. Experimental findings indicate that statistical
   significance is an effective quantitative indicator of the selection of
   brain network metrics and can assist the clinical diagnosis of
   depression.}},

Pages = {{339-348}},
Abstract = {{Background: Agitated behaviors are frequently observed in patients with
   Alzheimer disease (AD). The neural substrate underlying the agitated
   behaviors in dementia is unclear. We hypothesized that different
   dimensions of agitated behaviors are mediated by distinct neural
   systems.
   Methods: All the patients (n=32) underwent single photon emission
   computed tomography (SPECT). Using the Agitated Behavior in Dementia
   scale, we identified the relationships between regional cerebral blood
   flow (rCBF) patterns and the presence of each of three dimensions of
   agitated behavior (physically agitated behavior, verbally agitated
   behavior, and psychosis symptoms) in AD patients. Statistical parametric
   mapping (SPM) software was used to explore these neural correlations.
   Results: Physically agitated behavior was significantly correlated with
   lower rCBF values in the right superior temporal gyrus (Brodmann 22) and
   the right inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 47). Verbally agitated
   behavior was significantly associated with lower rCBF values in the left
   inferior frontal gyrus (Brodmann 46, 44) and the left insula (Brodmann
   13). The psychosis symptoms were significantly correlated with lower
   rCBF values in the right angular gyrus (Brodmann 39) and the right

Volume = {{307}},
Number = {{SI}},
Pages = {{153-162}},
Month = {{JAN}},
Abstract = {{Resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) using fMRI has become an
   important tool in examining differences in brain activity between
   patient and healthy populations. Studies employing rs-fc have
   successfully identified altered intrinsic neural networks in many
   neurological and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer's disease,
   schizophrenia, and more recently, tinnitus. The neural mechanisms of
   subjective tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound without an
   external source, are not well understood. Several inherent networks have
   been implicated in tinnitus; these include default mode, auditory,
   dorsal attention, and visual resting-state networks. Evidence from
   several studies has begun to suggest that tinnitus causes consistent
   modifications to these networks, including greater connectivity between
   limbic areas and cortical networks not traditionally involved with
   emotion processing, and increased connectivity between attention and
   auditory processing brain regions. Such consistent changes to these
   networks may allow for the identification of objective brain imaging
   measures of tinnitus, leading to a better understanding of the neural
   basis of the disorder. Further, examination of rs-fc allows us to
   correlate behavioral measures, such as tinnitus severity and comorbid
   factors including hearing loss, with specific intrinsic networks.

Abstract = {{As the demographic shift towards an aging population prevails, the
   improvement and/or maintenance of cognitive functioning appear
   increasingly important. To date, the effectiveness of cognitive,

   practice-induced structural and functional changes in the brain.
   Structurally, practice is associated with volumetric increases.
   Functionally, reorganization of neural network recruitment, overall
   decreases and increases in activity levels are found. Thus, the human
   brain retains a high degree of plasticity in old age. Moreover, it seems
   that practice leads to more efficient processing, requiring less neural
   engagement to perform the same task. While the concept of economization
   finds widespread support in healthy populations, in patient groups this
   effect has proven to be absent or reversed. The concept of cognitive
   reserve and potentially compensatory mechanisms are discussed in this

Abstract = {{We evaluated the brain metabolic correlates of main indexes of a widely

   Fifty-four subjects (age: 72.02 +/- 7.45; Mini-Mental State Examination
   (MMSE) score: 28.9 +/- 1.24) presenting at a memory clinic complaining
   of memory deficit, but not demented, and thirty controls (age: 71.87 +/-
   7.08; MMSE score: 29.1 +/- 1.1) were included. Subjects with memory
   complaints included both patients with (amnestic mild cognitive
   impairment, aMCI) and without (subjective memory complaints, SMC)
   impairment on memory tests. All subjects underwent
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), analyzed
   with statistical parametric. Patients with aMCI but not those with SMC
   showed the expected posterior cingulate-precuneus and parietal
   hypometabolism as compared to controls. Correlation was determined for
   between four indexes of the RAVLT and brain metabolism. The results show
   a significant correlation between the delayed recall score and
   metabolism in posterior cingulate gyrus of both hemispheres and in left
   precuneus, as well as between a score of long-term percent retention and
   metabolism in left posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus, and
   orbitofrontal areas. These correlations survived correction for age,
   education, and MMSE score. No correlation was found between immediate or
   total recall scores and glucose metabolism. These data show the relevant
   role of posterior cingulate-precuneus and orbitofrontal cortices in
   retention and retrieval of de-contextualized verbal memory material in a

   relational encoding}},
Journal = {{NEUROIMAGE}},
Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{84}},
Pages = {{19-26}},
Month = {{JAN 1}},
Abstract = {{Age-related declines in relational encoding are well documented. It
   remains unclear, however, whether such declines reflect dysfunction of
   (1) ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and deficient generation of
   associations; and/or (2) hippocampal dysfunction and impoverished
   binding of associations. In order to separate VLPFC and hippocampal
   contributions to relational encoding, we manipulated the generative
   demands of the encoding task by varying the number of semantic
   associations between the to-be-encoded information (three words). Thus,
   trials with fewer semantic associations (lower-association trials)
   require more generative processing during encoding, relative to trials
   in which more semantic associations are provided for binding
   (higher-association trials). Parametric modulation analyses on
   successfully encoded items revealed that, unlike younger adults, older
   adults did not show an up-regulation of VLPFC activity during
   lower-association trials. In contrast, hippocampal activity in both
   older and younger adults was greater in higher-relative to
   lower-association trials. Moreover, recognition accuracy improved
   significantly in both groups with the provision of more semantic
   associations, indicating that both younger and older adults benefitted
   from this form of encoding support. Our findings suggest that left VLPFC
   dysfunction may underlie relational encoding deficits in older adults,
   but that when provided with associations to bind, hippocampal activity
   in older adults is comparable to young, consistent with their increased
   recognition accuracy under conditions of encoding support. (C) 2013

Abstract = {{Medical content-based retrieval (MCBR) plays an important role in
   computer aided diagnosis and clinical decision support. Multi-modal
   imaging data have been increasingly used in MCBR, as they could provide
   more insights of the diseases and complement the deficiencies of

   different modalities since they have different physical fundamentals and
   large value range variations. In this study, we propose a novel
   Propagation Graph Fusion (PGF) framework for multi-modal medical data
   retrieval. PGF models the subjects' relationships in single modalities
   using the directed propagation graphs, and then fuses the graphs into a
   single graph by summing up the edge weights. Our proposed PGF method
   could reduce the large inter-modality and inter-subject variations, and
   can be solved efficiently using the PageRank algorithm. We test the
   proposed method on a public medical database with 331 subjects using
   features extracted from two imaging modalities, PET and MRI. The
   preliminary results show that our PGF method could enhance multi-modal
   retrieval and modestly outperform the state-of-the-art single-modal and

Abstract = {{Spindles are the main indicators of stage two sleep. Manual detection of
   spindles is tedious and time-consuming, hence many attempts have been
   performed to automatically detect them. Scientists have found that
   spindles are related to diseases such as Alzheimer's and Schizophrenia.
   Therefore, designing algorithms to extract certain spindle features to
   diagnose them with high accuracy is valuable. In this study, new chaotic
   features, along with a new training and classification algorithm has
   been used to detect spindles: an algorithm called MELM-GRBF (Modified
   Extreme Learning Machine). GBRF (Generalized Radial Basis Function) can
   update the radial basis function (RBF) using a parameter (tau), and the
   training algorithm is MELM. GRBF centers are selected randomly from the
   training data. The width and the parameter t of GRBF are achieved
   considering two limitations: locality and coverage. In order to have the
   most similarity between spindle and non-spindle segments and to
   demonstrate the capability of these (chaotic features and classifier)
   algorithms, non-spindles are extracted immediately before spindles occur
   for one second in sleep stage two. After presenting chaotic (Higuchi
   Fractal Dimension, Katz Fractal Dimension, Sevcik Fractal Dimension,
   Largest Lyapunov and Entropy) and time series features, the ELM-RBF and
   MELM-GRBF statistical results are compared. The Best average results of
   MELM-GRBF classifier after 15 training trials were, 93.10\%, 90.34\% and
   95.90\% for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity, respectively and the
   variances were 0.78, 1.61 and 1.16, respectively. While the ELM-RBF
   results for accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 91.06\%, 85.83\%

Abstract = {{Alzheimer disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease which can be

   evaluation of this disease, using computer aided methods, is of

   Brain images are first segmented into 116 regions according to an
   anatomical atlas. A spatial normalization and four grey level
   normalization methods are used for comparison. Each extracted region is
   then characterized by a feature set based on grey level histogram
   moments and age and gender. Using a receiver Operating Characteristic
   curve for each region, it was possible to rank region's ability to
   separate healthy from AD brain images. Using a set of selected regions,
   according to their rank, and when inputting them to a Support Vector
   Machine, it was possible to show that classification results were

Abstract = {{Positron emission tomography (PET) plays an important role in
   neurodegenerative disorder diagnosis and neuro-oncology applications,
   especially detecting the early metabolism anomalies in human brains.
   Current lesion detection algorithms can be roughly classified into
   voxel-based, region of interest (ROI)-based, and global algorithms.
   These methods may capture the scale and/or location of the lesions in
   brain, but other important properties, such as lesion metabolism rate
   and contrast to non-lesion parts are often ignored. To capture these
   important features, we propose a novel lesion detector with three
   lesion-centric feature descriptors for brain PET. We analyze the lesion
   patterns of 331 PET datasets from the ADNI baseline cohort and further
   perform t-test between different disorder groups to validate the new
   lesion-centric features. The preliminary results show that the proposed
   lesion detector is robust in capturing the brain lesions and has a great
   potential to be a predictive biomarker for neurological disorders.}},

Abstract = {{Functional brain imaging is a common tool in monitoring the progression
   of neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Identifying functional
   brain imaging derived features that can accurately detect neurological
   disease is of primary importance to the medical community. Research in
   computer vision techniques to identify objects in photographs have
   reported high accuracies in that domain, but their direct applicability
   to identifying disease in functional imaging is still under
   investigation in the medical community. In particular, Serre et al. (:
   In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
   (CVPR-05). pp 994-1000) introduced a biophysically inspired filtering
   method emulating visual processing in striate cortex which they applied
   to perform object recognition in photographs. In this work, the model
   described by Serre et al. {[}2005] is extended to three-dimensional
   volumetric images to perform signal detection in functional brain
   imaging (PET, SPECT). The filter outputs are used to train both neural
   network and logistic regression classifiers and tested on two distinct
   datasets: ADNI Alzheimer's disease 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and
   National Football League players Tc99m HMPAO SPECT. The filtering
   pipeline is analyzed to identify which steps are most important for

Abstract = {{Background: The role of folate and homocysteine in brain atrophy
   associated with Alzheimer's disease is not completely understood.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate the relationships
   between serum folate and homocysteine levels and the degree of
   cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy in a first relatively
   preliminary sample of the Treviso Dementia (TREDEM) study using a potent
   data mining method.
   Methods: Physiological data, biochemical parameters, clinical assessment
   data, brain atrophy severity assessed with CT scans, and
   neuropsycological and disability data were assessed in a group of 232
   outpatients (93 men and 139 women, aged 40.2-100 years) enrolled in the
   TREDEM study carried out in Treviso (Italy). A semantic connectivity map
   obtained through the Auto-CM system, a fourth generation artificial
   neural network (ANN), was used to offer some insight regarding the
   complex biological connections between the studied variables and the
   degree of brain atrophy.
   Results: Close associations between low serum folate levels and severe
   cortical-subcortical atrophy along with severe hippocampal atrophy
   measured by the width of the temporal horns of lateral ventricles were
   found. We also showed an association between high homocysteine levels
   and severe cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy.
   Conclusion: The role of folate, which is inversely associated with the
   severity of brain atrophy, was confirmed. Our results also confirm the
   association between high homocysteine levels and severe
   cortical-subcortical and hippocampal atrophy. Auto-CM ANN is able to
   highlight associations sometimes visible only in longitudinal studies
   through intelligent data mining of a cross-sectional study.}},

Year = {{2014}},
Volume = {{38}},
Number = {{2}},

Abstract = {{The objective of this work was to assess the predictive accuracy of
   targeted neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures for the detection
   of incipient dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment
   (MCI), and to examine the potential benefit of combining both classes of
   measures. Baseline MRI measures included hippocampal volume, cortical
   thickness, and white matter hyperintensities. Neuropsychological
   assessment focused on different aspects of episodic memory (i.e.,
   familiarity, free recall, and associative memory) and executive control
   functions (i.e., working memory, switching, and planning). Global and
   regional cortical thinning was observed in MCI patients who progressed
   to dementia compared to those who remained stable, whereas no
   differences were found between groups for baseline hippocampal volume
   and white matter hyperintensities. The strongest neuroimaging predictors
   were baseline cortical thickness in the right anterior cingulate and
   middle frontal gyri. For cognitive predictors, we found that deficits in
   both free recall and recognition episodic memory tasks were highly
   suggestive of progression to dementia. Cortical thinning in the right
   anterior cingulate gyrus, combined to controlled and familiarity-based
   retrieval deficits, achieved a classification accuracy of 87.5\%, a
   specificity of 90.9\%, and a sensitivity of 83.3\%. This predictive
   model including both classes of measures provided more accurate
   predictions than those based on neuroimaging or cognitive measures
   alone. Overall, our findings suggest that detecting preclinical
   Alzheimer's disease is probably best accomplished by combining
   complementary information from targeted neuroimaging and cognitive
   classifiers, and highlight the importance of taking into account both
   structural and functional changes associated with the disease.}},

Abstract = {{In this study, we used high-dimensional pattern regression methods based
   on structural (gray and white matter; GM and WM) and functional
   (positron emission tomography of regional cerebral blood flow; PET)
   brain data to identify cross-sectional imaging biomarkers of cognitive
   performance in cognitively normal older adults from the Baltimore
   Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA). We focused on specific components of
   executive and memory domains known to decline with aging, including
   manipulation, semantic retrieval, long-term memory (LTM), and short-term
   memory (STM). For each imaging modality, brain regions associated with
   each cognitive domain were generated by adaptive regional clustering. A
   relevance vector machine was adopted to model the nonlinear continuous
   relationship between brain regions and cognitive performance, with
   cross-validation to select the most informative brain regions (using
   recursive feature elimination) as imaging biomarkers and optimize model
   parameters. Predicted cognitive scores using our regression algorithm
   based on the resulting brain regions correlated well with actual
   performance. Also, regression models obtained using combined GM, WM, and
   PET imaging modalities outperformed models based on single modalities.
   Imaging biomarkers related to memory performance included the
   orbito-frontal and medial temporal cortical regions with LTM showing
   stronger correlation with the temporal lobe than STM. Brain regions
   predicting executive performance included orbito-frontal, and
   occipito-temporal areas. The PET modality had higher contribution to
   most cognitive domains except manipulation, which had higher WM
   contribution from the superior longitudinal fasciculus and the genu of
   the corpus callosum. These findings based on machine-learning methods
   demonstrate the importance of combining structural and functional
   imaging data in understanding complex cognitive mechanisms and also
   their potential usage as biomarkers that predict cognitive status.}},

Abstract = {{The temporal pole is unique to nonhuman and human primates, although
   other species also present temporal cortex. A clear distinction is made
   between the gross anatomical, macroscopic temporal pole, located at the
   tip of the temporal lobe, and the temporal polar cortex, which is a
   general term that encompasses all reported divisions and can be applied
   to both nonhuman and human primates. In the 19th century early
   neuroanatomists identified the temporal polar cortex as a different
   entity, independent from the remainder of the temporal lobe. More
   recently, the temporal polar cortex has been subdivided into different
   fields. The analysis of the different portions that make up the temporal
   polar cortex was first described in the nonhuman primate, and later on
   in humans. In this review we examine the historical course of the
   concepts about the extension, structure, and main cytoarchitectonic
   areas. The different descriptions are presented in chronological order
   and their relevance is discussed. In general, some common features arise
   in nonhuman and human primates temporopolar cortex, namely, an increased
   thickness of this cortical area, a predominant dysgranular type of
   cortex, and a more restricted extension in humans relative to earlier
   accounts. A common pattern of cytoarchitectonic areas results from the
   criteria of previous authors, although the sulcal anatomy of the human
   temporal pole has great variability. The understanding of the extension,
   composition, and limits of the temporal polar cortex is crucial for
   identification of separate regions in neuroimaging studies. J. Comp.

Abstract = {{Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) comprises of three clinical syndromes,
   behavioural-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), semantic dementia
   (SV-PPA), and progressive nonfluent aphasia (NFV-PPA) with unique
   underlying neuroanatomical deficits. To date, however, grey matter
   structural differences and their connecting white matter tracts in this
   network have been mostly characterised in comparison to controls,
   whereas within FTD subtype comparisons in the same patients have not
   been explored.
   In 94 participants, including bvFTD (n = 16), SV-PPA (n = 16) and
   NFV-PPA (n = 16), as well as an age-matched control group (n = 46), we
   employed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and diffusion tensor imaging
   (DTI) to examine grey and white matter key signatures in each of the
   three FTD subtypes.
   Our results showed that bvFTD had specific ventromedial prefrontal
   cortex and striatum grey matter atrophy along with their connecting
   white matter tracts compared to other FTD subtypes. By contrast, SV-PPA
   showed additional temporal pole grey matter damage to bvFTD and grey and
   white matter temporal, amygdala and insula changes compared to NFV-PPA.
   Finally, NFV-PPA showed mild insula grey and white matter changes
   compared to bvFTD but differed from SV-PPA only on anterior corpus
   callosum white matter changes.
   Our findings clearly indicate that not only grey matter regions of the
   FTD network but also their white matter connecting tracts have specific
   signatures for each FTD subtype. These promising findings highlight how
   neural network approaches can shed new light on neurodegenerative
   conditions and FTD in particular, which will inform future diagnostic
   and disease management.}},

Abstract = {{Neuropsychological studies have shown that alcohol dependence is
   associated with neurocognitive deficits in tasks requiring memory,
   perceptual motor skills, abstraction and problem solving, whereas
   language skills are relatively spared in alcoholics despite structural
   abnormalities in the language-related brain regions. To investigate the
   preserved mechanisms of language processing in alcohol-dependents,
   functional brain imaging was undertaken in healthy controls (n=18) and
   alcohol-dependents (n=16) while completing a lexical semantic judgment
   task in a 3 T MR scanner. Behavioural data indicated that
   alcohol-dependents took more time than controls for performing the task
   but there was no significant difference in their response accuracy. fMRI
   data analysis revealed that while performing the task, the alcoholics
   showed enhanced activations in left supramarginal gyrus, precuneus
   bilaterally, left angular gyrus, and left middle temporal gyrus as
   compared to control subjects. The extensive activations observed in
   alcoholics as compared to controls suggest that alcoholics recruit
   additional brain areas to meet the behavioural demands for equivalent
   task performance. The results are consistent with previous fMRI studies
   suggesting compensatory mechanisms for the execution of task for showing
   an equivalent performance or decreased neural efficiency of relevant
   brain networks. However, on direct comparison of the two groups, the
   results did not survive correction for multiple comparisons; therefore,

Abstract = {{Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) is typically described as a neurologic
   disorder affecting a cerebral network comprising the hippocampus proper
   and several anatomically related extrahippocampal regions. A new level
   of complexity was recently added to the study of this disorder by the
   evidence that TLE also appears to chronically alter the activity of
   several brain-wide neural networks involved in the control of higher
   order brain functions and not traditionally linked to epilepsy. Recently
   developed brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) analysis of resting state connectivity, have greatly
   contributed to these observations by allowing the precise
   characterization of several brain networks with distinct functional
   signatures in the resting brain, and therefore also known as resting
   state networks. These significant advances in imaging represent an
   opportunity to investigate the still elusive origins of the disabling
   cognitive and psychiatric manifestations of TLE, and could have
   important implications for its pathophysiology and, perhaps, its
   therapy. Herein we review recent studies in this field by focusing on

   brain activation which ought to reflect a functional unit in the neural
   network supporting that particular function. To address this issue, in
   the present study, we first mapped boundaries and 2 adjacent activations
   in the human inferior frontal cortex, and then examined the spatial
   relationship between the boundaries and the 2 activations. The
   boundaries mapped with high-resolution functional magnetic resonance

   approximately only 12 mm on average, much smaller than the Brodmann
   areas. Each of the 2 activations associated with 2 functions, response
   inhibition and feedback processing, was smaller in size than the
   micromodules. By comparing the spatial patterns between the boundaries

Abstract = {{Rare autosomal dominant mutations result in familial Alzheimer's disease
   (FAD) with a relatively consistent age of onset within families. This
   provides an estimate of years until disease onset (relative age) in
   mutation carriers. Increased AD risk has been associated with
   differences in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity
   during memory tasks, but most of these studies have focused on
   possession of apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4), a risk factor, but not
   causative variant, of late-onset AD. Evaluation of fMRI activity in
   presymptomatic FAD mutation carriers versus noncarriers provides insight
   into preclinical changes in those who will certainly develop AD in a
   prescribed period of time. Adults from FAD mutation-carrying families
   (nine mutation carriers, eight noncarriers) underwent fMRI scanning
   while performing a memory task. We examined fMRI signal differences
   between carriers and noncarriers, and how signal related to fMRI task
   performance within mutation status group, controlling for relative age
   and education. Mutation noncarriers had greater retrieval period
   activity than carriers in several AD-relevant regions, including the
   left hippocampus. Better performing noncarriers showed greater encoding
   period activity including in the parahippocampal gyrus. Poorer
   performing carriers showed greater retrieval period signal, including in
   the frontal and temporal lobes, suggesting underlying pathological
   processes. Hum Brain Mapp 34:3308-3319, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley

Abstract = {{It has been suggested that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism modulates
   episodic memory performance via effects on hippocampal neural circuitry.
   However, fMRI studies have yielded inconsistent results in this respect.
   Moreover, very few studies have examined the effect of met allele load
   on activation of memory circuitry. In the present study, we carried out
   a comprehensive analysis of the effects of the BDNF polymorphism on
   brain responses during episodic memory encoding and retrieval, including
   an investigation of the effect of met allele load on memory related
   activation in the medial temporal lobe. In contrast to previous studies,
   we found no evidence for an effect of BDNF genotype or met load during
   episodic memory encoding. Met allele carriers showed increased
   activation during successful retrieval in right hippocampus but this was
   contrast-specific and unaffected by met allele load. These results
   suggest that the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism does not, as previously
   claimed, exert an observable effect on neural systems underlying
   encoding of new information into episodic memory but may exert a subtle
   effect on the efficiency with which such information can be retrieved.}},

Abstract = {{w Episodic autobiographical memory (EAM) consists of personal events
   embedded within a specific spatiotemporal context. Patients with
   semantic dementia (SD) generally show preserved recent EAMs, but a
   controversy remains concerning their ability to retrieve remote ones.
   Only one fMRI study examined remote autobiographical memory in SD
   through a longitudinal case study (Maguire, Kumaran, Hassabis, \&
   Kopelman, 2010). Here, we propose a cross-sectional study to test the
   hippocamponeocortical up-regulation hypothesis, through a multimodal
   approach (gray matter volume, activation, connectivity analyses),
   directly comparing recent and remote autobiographical memory retrieval
   and collecting data to asses phenomelogical re-experiencing. EAM
   retrieval recruits a distributed network of brain regions, notably the
   hippocampus which is shown to be atrophied in SD, although some studies
   report no hippocampal atrophy in SD. Using fMRI, we examined recent and
   remote EAM retrieval in two SD patients with different profiles of
   hippocampal atrophy, compared to 12 healthy elders (HE). JPL presented
   severe bilateral hippocampal atrophy, while EP showed sparing of both
   hippocampi. Behaviourally, JPL was impaired at retrieving EAMs from both
   life periods and showed poorer use of visual mental imagery than HE,
   while EP retrieved memories which were as episodic as those of HE for
   both periods and relied on greater use of visual mental imagery than HE.
   Neuroimaging results showed that, for JPL, hyperactivations of the
   residual hippocampal tissue and of frontal, lateral temporal, occipital
   and parietal cortices did not efficiently compensate his
   autobiographical memory deficit EP however. presented hyperactivations
   in similar neocortical regions which appeared to be more efficient in
   compensating for atrophy elsewhere, since EP's EAM retrieval was
   preserved. Functional connectivity analyses focusing on the hippocampus
   showed how the residual hippocampal activity was connected to other
   brain areas. For JPL, recent autobiographical retrieval was associated
   with connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and middle occipital
   gyrus, while for EP, connectivity was detected between the anterior
   hippocampus and numerous regions (medial temporal, occipital, temporal,
   frontal, parietal) for both recent and remote periods. These findings
   suggest that intensification of hippocampal atrophy in SD strongly
   affects both recent and remote autobiographical recollection.
   Up-regulation of neocortical regions and functional hippocarnpal
   neocortical connectivity within the autobiographical network may be
   insufficient to compensate the lifelong episodic memory deficit for
   patients with extensive hippocampal atrophy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Non-fluent/agrammatic primary progressive aphasia (naPPA) is a
   progressive neurodegenerative condition most prominently associated with
   slowed, effortful speech. A clinical imaging marker of naPPA is disease
   centered in the left inferior frontal lobe. We used multimodal imaging
   to assess large-scale neural networks underlying effortful expression in
   15 patients with sporadic naPPA due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration
   (FTLD) spectrum pathology. Effortful speech in these patients is related
   in part to impaired grammatical processing, and to phonologic speech
   errors. Gray matter (GM) imaging shows frontal and anterior-superior
   temporal atrophy, most prominently in the left hemisphere. Diffusion
   tensor imaging reveals reduced fractional anisotropy in several white
   matter (WM) tracts mediating projections between left frontal and other
   GM regions. Regression analyses suggest disruption of three large-scale
   GM-WM neural networks in naPPA that support fluent, grammatical
   expression. These findings emphasize the role of large-scale neural
   networks in language, and demonstrate associated language deficits in
   naPPA. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is

   (3 with post mortem confirmation of AD and 5 with positive amyloid
   PIB-PET scans) were studied with longitudinal T1-weighted MR imaging
   (mean interscan interval 1.2 years) using volumetric analysis and
   voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Baseline imaging showed asymmetrical
   (left greater than right) involvement of the posterior superior temporal
   and inferior parietal lobes as well as posterior cingulate and medial
   temporal lobes. The whole brain rate of volume loss was 2.0\% per year
   with a greater rate of left hemisphere atrophy (2.3\%/year) than right
   hemisphere (1.6\%/year). Longitudinal VBM analysis showed increasing
   involvement of other areas in the left hemisphere (temporal, parietal,
   frontal and caudate) and atrophy of areas in the right hemisphere that
   had been involved earlier in the disease in the left hemisphere,
   particularly posterior cingulate/precuneus. With disease progression
   there was worsening of anomia, sentence repetition and sentence

Abstract = {{Sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a prevalent, complex and
   chronically progressive brain disease. Its course is non-linear,
   dynamic, adaptive to maladaptive, and compensatory to decompensatory,
   affecting large-scale neural networks through a plethora of mechanistic
   and signaling pathway alterations that converge into regional and cell
   type-specific neurodegeneration and, finally, into clinically overt
   cognitive and behavioral decline. This decline includes reductions in
   the activities of daily living, quality of life, independence, and life
   expectancy.
   Evolving lines of research suggest that epigenetic mechanisms may play a
   crucial role during AD development and progression. Epigenetics
   designates molecular mechanisms that alter gene expression without
   modifications of the genetic code. This topic includes modifications on
   DNA and histone proteins, the primary elements of chromatin structure.
   Accumulating evidence has revealed the relevant processes that mediate
   epigenetic modifications and has begun to elucidate how these processes
   are apparently dysregulated in AD. This evidence has led to the
   clarification of the roles of specific classes of therapeutic compounds
   that affect epigenetic pathways and characteristics of the epigenome.
   This insight is accompanied by the development of new methods for
   studying the global patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin
   alterations. In particular, high-throughput sequencing approaches, such
   as next-generation DNA sequencing techniques, are beginning to drive the
   field into the next stage of development. In parallel, genetic imaging
   is beginning to answer additional questions through its ability to
   uncover genetic variants, with or without genome-wide significance, that
   are related to brain structure, function and metabolism, which impact
   disease risk and fundamental network-based cognitive processes.
   Neuroimaging measures can further be used to define AD systems and
   endophenotypes. The integration of genetic neuroimaging methods with
   epigenetic markers in humans appears promising. This evolving
   development may lead to a new research discipline - imaging epigenetics
   -that will provide deeper insight into the causative pathogenetic and
   pathophysiological pathways through which genes and environment
   interrelate during life and impact human brain development, physiology,
   aging and disease. This knowledge may open doors for the development of
   novel biomarkers and preventive and disease-modifying treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Introduction of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) in 1980 and its

   of functional and structural neural network coordination contributes to
   the cognitive dysfunction in AD. Therefore, detection of loss of

   stages of disease which may prove essential for future preventive AD
   treatment trials. Moreover, structural integrity measured by DTI may
   help to distinguish between symptomatic and disease modifying effects of

   the physical basis of DTI acquisition and processing. We summarize DTI
   findings in normal aging and AD and regarding the effects of cognitive

Journal = {{BMC BIOINFORMATICS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{14}},

Month = {{OCT 22}},
Abstract = {{Motivation: Multivariate quantitative traits arise naturally in recent
   neuroimaging genetics studies, in which both structural and functional
   variability of the human brain is measured non-invasively through
   techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is growing
   interest in detecting genetic variants associated with such multivariate
   traits, especially in genome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs)
   classifiers, which are ensembles of decision trees, are amongst the best
   performing machine learning algorithms and have been successfully
   employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in case-control
   studies. RFs can also be applied to produce gene rankings in association
   studies with multivariate quantitative traits, and to estimate genetic
   similarities measures that are predictive of the trait. However, in
   studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs and high-dimensional
   traits, a very large ensemble of trees must be inferred from the data in
   order to obtain reliable rankings, which makes the application of these
   algorithms computationally prohibitive.
   Results: We have developed a parallel version of the RF algorithm for
   regression and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale
   population genetic association studies involving multivariate traits,
   called PaRFR (Parallel Random Forest Regression). Our implementation
   takes advantage of the MapReduce programming model and is deployed on
   Hadoop, an open-source software framework that supports data-intensive
   distributed applications. Notable speed-ups are obtained by introducing
   a distance-based criterion for node splitting in the tree estimation
   process. PaRFR has been applied to a genome-wide association study on
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which the quantitative trait consists of a
   high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotype describing longitudinal changes
   in the human brain structure. PaRFR provides a ranking of SNPs
   associated to this trait, and produces pair-wise measures of genetic
   proximity that can be directly compared to pair-wise measures of
   phenotypic proximity. Several known AD-related variants have been
   identified, including APOE4 and TOMM40. We also present experimental
   evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between the
   number of top-ranked mutated states, or frequent mutation patterns, and
   an indicator of disease severity.

Abstract = {{Diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) has been difficult
   because of the absence of obvious focal brain lesions, using

   characterize potential tissue and neural network damage objectively is
   Lempel-Ziv complexity (LZC) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG)
   signals. LZC is a model-independent estimator of system complexity that
   estimates the number of different patterns in a sequence. We
   hypothesized that because of the potential network damage, TBIs would
   show a reduced level of complexity in regions that are impaired. We
   included 18 healthy controls and 18 military veterans with TBI in the
   study. Resting state MEG data were acquired, and the LZCs were analyzed
   across the whole brain. Our results indicated reduced complexity in
   multiple brain areas in TBI patients relative to the healthy controls.
   In addition, we detected several neuropsychological measures associated
   with motor responses, visual perception, and memory, correlated with
   LZC, which likely explains some of the cognitive deficits in TBI

Abstract = {{The Met allele of the Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
   Val(66)Met polymorphism has been associated with impaired
   activity-dependent secretion of BDNF protein and decreased memory
   performance. Results from imaging studies relating Val(66)Met to brain
   activation during memory processing have been inconsistent, with reports
   of both increased and decreased activation in the Medial Temporal Lobe
   (MTL) in Met carriers relative to Val homozygotes. Here, we extensively
   studied BDNF Val(66)Met in relation to brain activation and white matter
   integrity as well as memory performance in a large imaging (n=194) and
   behavioral (n=2229) sample, respectively. Functional magnetic resonance
   imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate MTL activation in healthy
   participants in the age of 55-75 years during a face-name episodic
   encoding and retrieval task. White matter integrity was measured using
   diffusion tensor imaging.
   BDNF Met allele carriers had significantly decreased activation in the
   MTL during encoding processes, but not during retrieval processes. In
   contrast to previous proposals, the effect was not modulated by age and
   the polymorphism was not related to white matter integrity. Met carriers
   had lower memory performance than Val homozygotes, but differences were
   subtle and not significant. In conclusion, the BDNF Met allele has a
   negative influence on MTL functioning, preferentially during encoding
   processes, which might translate into impaired episodic memory function.

Abstract = {{Brain structure and cognitive function change in the temporal lobe,
   hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex of patients with mild cognitive
   impairment and Alzheimer's disease, and brain network-connection
   strength, network efficiency, and nodal attributes are abnormal.
   However, existing research has only analyzed the differences between
   these patients and normal controls. In this study, we constructed brain
   networks using resting-state functional MRI data that was extracted from
   four populations (normal controls, patients with early mild cognitive
   impairment, patients with late mild cognitive impairment, and patients
   with Alzheimer's disease) using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
   Initiative data set. The aim was to analyze the characteristics of
   resting-state functional neural networks, and to observe mild cognitive
   impairment at different stages before the transformation to Alzheimer's
   disease. Results showed that as cognitive deficits increased across the
   four groups, the shortest path in the resting-state functional network
   gradually increased, while clustering coefficients gradually decreased.
   This evidence indicates that dementia is associated with a decline of
   brain network efficiency. In addition, the changes in functional
   networks revealed the progressive deterioration of network function
   across brain regions from healthy elderly adults to those with mild
   cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease. The alterations of node
   attributes in brain regions may reflect the cognitive functions in brain
   regions, and we speculate that early impairments in memory, hearing, and
   language function can eventually lead to diffuse brain injury and other
   cognitive impairments.}},

Abstract = {{The EEG is an accessible tool for detecting encephalopathy, which
   usually manifests as delirium and sometimes as coma. Several
   disturbances have been described in the EEG of patients with

   pathophysiology of these EEG alterations, however, is poorly understood.
   This article shows that simulating activity of large populations of

   increase our understanding of EEG disturbances in encephalopathy. We
   provide a brief introduction on the concepts of neural mass modeling and
   graph theoretical network analysis, and insights from this approach in
   previous work on neurologic disease, with a focus on encephalopathy.
   Finally, we speculate how anatomically coupled neural mass modeling

Abstract = {{We investigated the parameters of colored noise in EEG data of 17 722
   professional drivers aged 18-70. The whole study is based upon
   experiments showing that biological neural networks may operate in the
   vicinity of the critical point and that the balance between excitation
   and inhibition in the human brain is important for the transfer of
   information. This paper is devoted to the study of EEG power spectrum
   which can be described best by a power function with 1/f(lambda)
   distribution and colored noise corresponding to the critical point in
   the EEG signal has the value of lambda = 1 (purple noise). The slow
   accumulation of energy and its quick release is a universal property of
   the 1/f distribution. The physiological mechanism causing energy
   dissipation in the brain seems to depend on the number and strength of
   the connections between clusters of neurons. With ageing, the number of
   connections between the neurons decreases. Learning ability and
   intellectual performance also decrease. Therefore, age-related changes
   in the lambda coefficient can be anticipated. We found that absolute
   values of lambda coefficients decrease significantly with increasing
   age. Deviations from this rule are related to age-dependent slowing of
   the dominant frequency in the alpha band. Age-dependent change in the
   parameter and colored noise may be indicative of age-related changes in
   the self-organization of brain activity. Results obtained include (i)
   the age-dependent decrease of the absolute values of the average lambda
   coefficient with the regression coefficient 0.005 1/year, (ii)
   distribution of lambda value changes related to EEG frequency bands and
   to localization of electrodes on the scalp, and (iii) relation of
   age-dependent changes of colored noise and EEG energy in separate

Abstract = {{Cross-Approximate Entropy (Cross-ApEn) is a useful measure to quantify
   the statistical dissimilarity of two time series. In spite of the
   advantage of Cross-ApEn over its one-dimensional counterpart
   (Approximate Entropy), only a few studies have applied it to biomedical
   signals, mainly due to its high computational cost. In this paper, we
   propose a fast GPU-based implementation of the Cross-ApEn that makes
   feasible its use over a large amount of multidimensional data. The
   scheme followed is fully scalable, thus maximizes the use of the GPU
   despite of the number of neural signals being processed. The approach
   consists in processing many trials or epochs simultaneously, with
   independence of its origin. In the case of MEG data, these trials can
   proceed from different input channels or subjects. The proposed
   implementation achieves an average speedup greater than 250x against a
   CPU parallel version running on a processor containing six cores. A
   dataset of 30 subjects containing 148 MEG channels (49 epochs of 1024
   samples per channel) can be analyzed using our development in about 30
   min. The same processing takes 5 days on six cores and 15 days when
   running on a single core. The speedup is much larger if compared to a
   basic sequential Matlab (R) implementation, that would need 58 days per
   subject. To our knowledge, this is the first contribution of Cross-ApEn
   measure computation using GPUs. This study demonstrates that this
   hardware is, to the day, the best option for the signal processing of
   biomedical data with Cross-ApEn. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All

Abstract = {{Autobiographical memory is commonly impaired in Alzheimer's disease
   (AD). However, little is known about the very recent past which is
   though highly important in daily life adaptation. In addition, the
   impact of sleep disturbances, also frequently reported in AD, on the
   consolidation, and retrieval of autobiographical memories remains to be
   assessed. Using an adaptation of the TEMPau task, we investigated the
   neural substrates of autobiographical memory for recent events and the
   potential relationship with sleep in 14 patients with mild AD. On day 1,
   autobiographical memory was explored across three periods: remote (18-30
   years), the last 2 years and the last month. After testing, sleep was
   recorded using polysomnography. The next day, AD patients benefited a
   resting-state (18)FDG-PET scan and a second exploration of
   autobiographical memory, focusing on the very recent past (today and
   yesterday). Total recall and episodic recall scores were obtained. In
   addition, for all events recalled, Remember responses justified by
   specific factual, spatial, and temporal details were measured using the
   Remember/Know paradigm. Retrieval of autobiographical memories was
   impaired in AD, but recall of young adulthood and very recent events was
   relatively better compared to the two intermediate periods. Recall of
   recent events (experienced the day and the day preceding the assessment)
   was correlated with brain glucose consumption in the precuneus and
   retrosplenial cortex, the calcarine region, the angular gyrus, and
   lateral temporal areas. AD patients also provided more Justified
   Remember responses for events experienced the previous-day than for
   those experienced the day of the assessment. Moreover, Justified
   Remember responses obtained for events experienced before sleep were
   positively correlated with the amount of slow-wave sleep. These data
   provide the first evidence of an association between the ability to
   retrieve recent autobiographical memories and sleep in mild AD patients.}},

Month = {{SEP 12}},
Abstract = {{Our ability to form abstract representations of objects in semantic
   memory is crucial to language and thought. The utility of this
   information relies both on the representations of sensory-motor feature
   knowledge stored in long-term memory and the executive processes
   required to retrieve, manipulate, and evaluate this semantic knowledge
   in a task-relevant manner. These complementary components of semantic
   memory can be differentially impacted by aging. We investigated semantic
   processing in normal aging using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Young and older adults were asked to judge whether two printed
   object names match on a particular feature (for example, whether a
   tomato and strawberry have the same color). The task thus required both
   retrieval of relevant visual feature knowledge of object concepts and
   evaluating this information. Objects were drawn from either natural
   kinds or manufactured objects, and were queried on either color or shape
   in a factorial design. Behaviorally, all subjects performed well, but
   older adults could be divided into those whose performance matched that
   of young adults (better performers) and those whose performance was
   worse (poorer performers). All subjects activated several cortical
   regions while performing this task, including bilateral inferior and
   lateral temporal cortex and left frontal and prefrontal cortex. Better
   performing older adults showed increased overall activity in bilateral
   premotor cortex and left lateral occipital cortex compared to young
   adults, and increased activity in these brain regions relative to poorer
   performing older adults who also showed gray matter atrophy in premotor
   cortex. These findings highlight the contribution of domain-general
   executive processing brain regions to semantic memory, and illustrate
   differences in how these regions are recruited in healthy older adults.}},

Abstract = {{Background: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has great
   potential for measuring mechanisms of functional changes in Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment, but task fMRI studies have
   produced conflicting results, partly due to failure to account for
   underlying morphological changes and to variations in patients' ability
   to perform the tasks. Resting fMRI has potential for assessing brain
   function independently from a task, but greater understanding of how
   networks of resting functional connectivity relate to the functioning of
   the brain is needed. We combined resting fMRI and task fMRI to examine
   the correspondence between these methods in individuals with cognitive
   impairment.
   Methods: Eighty elderly (25 control subjects, 25 mild cognitive
   impairment, 30 AD) underwent a combined multimodal magnetic resonance
   imaging protocol including task fMRI and resting fMRI. Task fMRI data
   were acquired during the execution of a memory paradigm designed to
   account for differences in task performance. Structural and
   physiological confounds were modeled for both fMRI modalities.
   Results: Successful recognition was associated with increased task fMRI
   activation in lateral prefrontal regions in AD relative to control
   subjects; this overlapped with increased resting fMRI functional
   connectivity in the same regions.
   Conclusions: Our results show that task fMRI and resting fMRI are
   sensitive markers of residual ability over the known changes in brain
   morphology and cognition occurring in AD and suggest that resting fMRI
   has a potential to measure the effect of new treatments.}},

Abstract = {{Alzheimer's disease (AD) is considered to be the most common and the
   fastest growing neurological disease in the world. Biomarker tools for
   early diagnosis and disease progression in AD remain key issues for
   clinical applications (patient's control and monitoring), sanitary
   systems (growth of prevalence of AD in the near future), and
   pharmaceutical companies (drug developments). Electroencephalogram (EEG)
   yields, in principle, a powerful and relatively cheap way for screening
   of dementia and AD in their early stages although not reaching the
   specificity prescribed for clinical use. Portable EEG systems based on
   wireless sensors can be used for unobtrusive long term monitoring
   provided they can solve technological problems (e. g., size and
   operational lifetime of batteries). Clinical applications require
   intensive recording of massive EEG data, raising the need for efficient,
   and flexible compression techniques. In this paper, this compression
   problem is viewed from a different perspective: is it possible to
   imagine a compressive sampling/sensing system that not only can reduce
   the throughput data but can also discriminate among brain states? If
   this is the case, it would be possible to distinguish among AD patients,
   mild cognitive impaired (MCI) subjects and normal healthy elderly.
   Accordingly, this paper investigates the performance of EEG compression
   techniques to recover data with the quality required by clinical
   constraints when making an assessment of the patients' status
   simultaneously. A sparsity coefficient is shown to be a good marker of
   AD being able to differentiate AD EEG from both MCI and healthy
   controls. The research, carried out on an experimental database, also
   compare the thresholding wavelet approach to the emerging method of
   compressive sensing. The results show the relationships between the
   compression ratio and the entropic measures of EEG complexity, whose
   reduction is considered the hallmark of AD onset.}},

   examined the association of mTBI with memory and the brain by comparing
   young and middle-aged adults who have had mTBI in their recent (several
   years ago) and remote (several decades ago) past, respectively, with
   control subjects on a face-scene relational memory paradigm while they
   underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Hippocampal
   volumes were also examined from high-resolution structural images.
   Results indicated middle-aged adults with a head injury in their remote
   past had impaired memory compared to gender, age, and education matched
   control participants, consistent with previous results in the study of
   memory, aging, and TBI. The present findings extended previous results
   by demonstrating that these individuals also had smaller bilateral
   hippocampi, and had reduced neural activity during memory performance in
   cortical regions important for memory retrieval. These results indicate
   that a history of mTBI may be one of the many factors that negatively
   influence cognitive and brain health in aging.}},

Abstract = {{Purpose of reviewThe aim is to assess whether the recent surge in brain
   connectivity' studies has improved our understanding of neurological
   deficits and in particular so-called disconnection syndromes.Recent
   findingsAcross a large variety of brain diseases, functional
   connectivity measures obtained from resting state' studies show
   alterations in distributed neural networks that may be of explanatory
   value for disease severity. In parallel, studies of structural
   connectivity reveal how damage to identified fiber tracts can yield
   specific clinical symptoms. These methods are not only permitting
   testing of the disconnection mechanism in the few syndromes where it has
   classically been suspected, but also starting to propose disconnection
   accounts for other syndromes that have not been conceptualized this way
   before. Finally, both structural and functional connectivity studies
   contribute to improve the mechanistic understanding of cognitive
   deficits in disseminated white matter disease.SummaryIn many respects,
   studies of structural and functional connectivity using MRI are
   providing critical novel empirical evidence for - and also against -
   disconnection as the relevant pathomechanism in neurological syndromes.
   At the same time, the observation of altered long-range correlation of
   activity in a wide variety of brain diseases may also be overinterpreted
   as disconnection, which dilutes an originally rather specific
   understanding of this concept.}},

Abstract = {{Recent reports of functional and anatomical studies have provided
   evidence that aberrant neural connectivity lies at the heart of many
   mental disorders. Information related to neural networks has elucidated
   the nonlinear dynamical complexity in brain signals over a range of
   temporal scales. The recent advent of nonlinear analytic methods, which
   have served for the quantitative description of the brain signal
   complexity, has provided new insights into aberrant neural connectivity
   in many mental disorders. Although many studies have underpinned
   aberrant neural connectivity, findings related to complexity behavior
   are still inconsistent. This inconsistency might result from (i)
   heterogeneity in mental disorders, (ii) analytical issues, (iii)
   interference of typical development and aging. First, most mental
   disorders are heterogeneous in their clinical feature or intrinsic
   pathological mechanisms. Second, neurophysiologic output signals from
   complex brain connectivity might be characterized with multiple time
   scales or frequencies. Finally, age-related brain complexity changes
   must be considered when investigating pathological brain because typical
   brain complexity is not constant across generations. Future systematic
   studies addressing these issues will greatly expand our knowledge of
   neural connections and dynamics related to mental disorders. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Autobiographical memory in amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) is
   characterized by impaired retrieval of episodic memories, but relatively
   preserved personal semantic knowledge. This study aimed to identify (via
   FDG-PET) the neural substrates of impaired episodic specificity of
   autobiographical memories in 35 aMCI patients compared with 24 healthy
   elderly controls. Significant correlations between regional cerebral
   activity and the proportion of episodic details in autobiographical
   memories from two life periods were found in specific regions of an
   autobiographical brain network. In aMCI patients, more than in controls,
   specifically episodic memories from early adulthood were associated with
   metabolic activity in the cuneus and in parietal regions. We
   hypothesized that variable retrieval of episodic autobiographical
   memories in our aMCI patients would be related to their variable
   capacity to reactivate specific sensory-perceptual and contextual
   details of early adulthood events linked to reduced (occipito-parietal)
   visual imagery and less efficient (parietal) attentional processes. For
   recent memories (last year), a correlation emerged between the
   proportion of episodic details and activity in lateral temporal regions
   and the temporo-parietal junction. Accordingly, variable episodic memory
   for recent events may be related to the efficiency of controlled search
   through general events likely to provide cues for the retrieval of
   episodic details and to the ability to establish a self perspective

Abstract = {{Anatomical segmentation of structures of interest is critical to
   quantitative analysis in medical imaging. Several automated multi-atlas
   based segmentation propagation methods that utilise manual delineations
   from multiple templates appear promising. However, high levels of
   accuracy and reliability are needed for use in diagnosis or in clinical
   trials. We propose a new local ranking strategy for template selection
   based on the locally normalised cross correlation (LNCC) and an
   extension to the classical STAPLE algorithm by Warfield et al. (2004),
   which we refer to as STEPS for Similarity and Truth Estimation for
   Propagated Segmentations. It addresses the well-known problems of local
   vs. global image matching and the bias introduced in the performance
   estimation due to structure size. We assessed the method on hippocampal
   segmentation using a leave-one-out cross validation with optimised model
   parameters; STEPS achieved a mean Dice score of 0.925 when compared with
   manual segmentation. This was significantly better in terms of
   segmentation accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art fusion
   techniques. Furthermore, due to the finer anatomical scale, STEPS also
   obtains more accurate segmentations even when using only a third of the
   templates, reducing the dependence on large template databases. Using a
   subset of Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) scans from
   different MRI imaging systems and protocols, STEPS yielded similarly
   accurate segmentations (Dice = 0.903). A cross-sectional and
   longitudinal hippocampal volumetric study was performed on the ADNI
   database. Mean +/- SD hippocampal volume (mm(3)) was 5195 +/- 656 for
   controls; 4786 +/- 781 for MCI; and 4427 +/- 903 for Alzheimer's disease
   patients and hippocampal atrophy rates (\%/year) of 1.09 +/- 3.0, 2.74
   +/- 3.5 and 4.04 +/- 3.6 respectively. Statistically significant (p <
   10(-3)) differences were found between disease groups for both
   hippocampal volume and volume change rates. Finally, STEPS was also
   applied in a multi-label segmentation propagation scenario using a
   leave-one-out cross validation, in order to parcellate 83 separate
   structures of the brain. Comparisons of STEPS with state-of-the-art
   multi-label fusion algorithms showed statistically significant

Abstract = {{Discriminative features have to be properly extracted and selected from
   the electroencephalographic (EEG) signals of each specific subject in
   order to achieve an adaptive brain-computer interface (BCI) system. This
   work presents an efficient wrapper-based methodology for feature
   selection and least squares discrimination of high-dimensional EEG data
   with low computational complexity. Features are computed in different
   time segments using three widely used methods for motor imagery tasks
   and, then, they are concatenated or averaged in order to take into
   account the time course variability of the EEG signals. Once EEG
   features have been extracted, proposed framework comprises two stages.
   The first stage entails feature ranking and, in this work, two different
   procedures have been considered, the least angle regression (LARS) and
   the Wilcoxon rank sum test, to compare the performance of each one. The
   second stage selects the most relevant features using an efficient
   leave-one-out (LOO) estimation based on the Allen's PRESS statistic.
   Experimental comparisons with the state-of-the-art BCI methods shows
   that this approach gives better results than current state-of-the-art
   approaches in terms of recognition rates and computational requirements

Abstract = {{Introduction: Degraded social function, disinhibition, and stereotypy
   are defining characteristics of frontotemporal dementia (FTD),
   manifesting in both the behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia
   (bvFTD) and semantic dementia (SD) subtypes. Recent neuroimaging
   research also associates FTD with alterations in the brain's intrinsic
   connectivity networks. The present study explored the relationship
   between neural network connectivity and specific behavioral symptoms in
   FTD.
   Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was
   employed to investigate neural network changes in bvFTD and SD. We used
   independent components analysis (ICA) to examine changes in frontolimbic
   network connectivity, as well as several metrics of local network
   strength, such as the fractional amplitude of low-frequency
   fluctuations, regional homogeneity, and seed-based functional
   connectivity. For each analysis, we compared each FTD subgroup to
   healthy controls, characterizing general and subtype-unique network
   changes. The relationship between abnormal connectivity in FTD and
   behavior disturbances was explored.
   Results: Across multiple analytic approaches, both bvFTD and SD were
   associated with disrupted frontolimbic connectivity and elevated local
   connectivity within the prefrontal cortex. Even after controlling for
   structural atrophy, prefrontal hyperconnectivity was robustly associated
   with apathy scores. Frontolimbic disconnection was associated with lower
   disinhibition scores, suggesting that abnormal frontolimbic connectivity
   contributes to positive symptoms in dementia. Unique to bvFTD,
   stereotypy was associated with elevated default network connectivity in
   the right angular gyrus. The behavioral variant was also associated with
   marginally higher apathy scores and a more diffuse pattern of prefrontal
   hyperconnectivity than SD.
   Conclusions: The present findings support a theory of FTD as a disorder
   of frontolimbic disconnection leading to unconstrained prefrontal
   connectivity. Prefrontal hyperconnectivity may represent a compensatory
   response to the absence of affective feedback during the planning and
   execution of behavior. Increased reliance upon prefrontal processes in
   isolation from subcortical structures appears to be maladaptive and may
   drive behavioral withdrawal that is commonly observed in later phases of
   neurodegeneration. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Deficits in memory for everyday activities are common complaints among
   healthy and demented older adults. The medial temporal lobes and
   dorsolateral prefrontal cortex are both affected by aging and
   early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and are known to influence performance
   on laboratory memory tasks. We investigated whether the volume of these
   structures predicts everyday memory. Cognitively healthy older adults
   and older adults with mild Alzheimer's-type dementia watched movies of
   everyday activities and completed memory tests on the activities.
   Structural MRI was used to measure brain volume. Medial temporal but not
   prefrontal volume strongly predicted subsequent memory. Everyday memory
   depends on segmenting activity into discrete events during perception,
   and medial temporal volume partially accounted for the relationship
   between performance on the memory tests and performance on an
   event-segmentation task. The everyday-memory measures used in this study
   involve retrieval of episodic and semantic information as well as
   working memory updating. Thus, the current findings suggest that during
   perception, the medial temporal lobes support the construction of event
   representations that determine subsequent memory.}},

Abstract = {{We examined the hypothesis that the attention/executive deficits in mild
   cognitive impairment (MCI) due to Alzheimer's disease is associated to
   an abnormal cortical activation, revealed by the method of event-related
   synchronization/desynchronization (ERS/ERD) in the theta band during a
   paradigm of temporal orienting of attention. MCI patients (n = 25) and
   healthy elderly (HE) matched controls (n = 15) performed a task in which
   periodically omitted tones had to be predicted and their virtual onset
   time had to be marked by pressing a button. Single-trial theta responses
   were measured, respectively, before and after the motor response. Then,
   theta responses were compared to theta power during eyes closed resting
   state (ERD/ERS method).The temporal course of the task was characterized
   by two different behavioural conditions: (1) a pre-event epoch, in which
   the subject awaited the virtual onset of the omitted tone, (2) a
   post-event (after button pressing) epoch, in which the subject was in a
   post-motor response condition. The most important findings are
   summarized as follows: (1) in both groups, the pre-event epoch was
   characterized by theta ERS on temporal electrodes, but HE had a greater
   theta ERS compared to that of MCI group; (2) in both groups, during the
   post-motor condition, there was a theta ERS on prefrontal regions, and,
   also in this case, HE showed a greater theta enhancement compared to
   that of MCI patients; (3) HE showed evidence of lateralization: during
   the waiting epoch, theta ERS was dominant on the right posterior
   temporal lead (T6), whilst, during the post-motor epoch, theta ERS was
   greater on the left, as well as the midline prefrontal leads. Compared
   to the traditional neuropsychological measures for the episodic memory,
   these theta ERS indicators were less accurate in differentiating MCI
   patients from healthy elderly. The clinical relevance of these findings
   is that the weaker theta reactivity in MCI would indicate an early
   impairment in the temporal orienting of attention in the early stage of
   the clinical course of this neurodegenerative disease.}},

Abstract = {{fMRI studies have linked the posteromedial cortex to episodic learning
   (encoding) and remembering (retrieval) processes. The posteromedial
   cortex is considered part of the default network and tends to deactivate
   during encoding but activate during retrieval, a pattern known as the
   encoding/retrieval flip. Yet, the exact relationship between the neural
   correlates of memory performance (hit/miss) and memory stage
   (encoding/retrieval) and the extent of overlap with intrinsic cortical
   networks remains to be elucidated. Using task-based fMRI, we isolated
   the pattern of activity associated with memory performance, memory
   stage, and the interaction between both. Using resting-state fMRI, we
   identified which intrinsic large-scale functional networks overlapped
   with regions showing task-induced effects. Our results demonstrated an
   effect of successful memory performance in regions associated with the
   control network and an effect of unsuccessful memory performance in the
   ventral attention network. We found an effect of memory retrieval in
   brain regions that span the default and control networks. Finally, we
   found an interaction between memory performance and memory stage in
   brain regions associated with the default network, including the
   posteromedial cortex, posterior parietal cortex, and parahippocampal
   cortex. We discuss these findings in relation to the encoding/retrieval
   flip. In general, the findings demonstrate that task-induced effects cut
   across intrinsic cortical networks. Furthermore, regions within the
   default network display functional dissociations, and this may have
   implications for the neural underpinnings of age-related memory

Volume = {{74}},

Abstract = {{The present functional imaging study aimed at investigating the
   contribution of the mediodorsal nucleus and the anterior nuclei of the
   thalamus with their related cortical networks to recognition memory and
   recall. Eighteen subjects performed associative picture encoding
   followed by a single item recognition test during the functional
   magnetic resonance imaging session. After scanning, subjects performed a
   cued recall test using the formerly recognized pictures as cues. This
   post-scanning test served to classify recognition trials according to
   subsequent recall performance.
   In general, single item recognition accompanied by successful recall of
   the associations elicited stronger activation in the mediodorsal nucleus
   of the thalamus and in the prefrontal cortices both during encoding and
   retrieval compared to recognition without recall. In contrast, the
   anterior nuclei of the thalamus were selectively active during the
   retrieval phase of recognition followed by recall. A correlational
   analysis showed that activation of the anterior thalamus during
   retrieval as assessed by measuring the percent signal changes predicted
   lower rates of recognition without recall.
   These findings show that the thalamus is critical for recognition
   accompanied by recall, and provide the first evidence of a functional
   segregation of the thalamic nuclei with respect to the memory retrieval
   phase. In particular, the mediodorsal thalamic-prefrontal cortical
   network is activated during successful encoding and retrieval of
   associations, which suggests a role of this system in recall and
   recollection. The activity of the anterior thalamic-temporal network
   selectively during retrieval predicts better memory performances across
   subjects and this confirms the paramount role of this network in recall
   and recollection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Resting state brain networks (RSNs) are spatially distributed
   large-scale networks, evidenced by resting state functional magnetic
   resonance imaging (fMRI) studies. Importantly, RSNs are implicated in
   several relevant brain functions and present abnormal functional
   patterns in many neuropsychiatric disorders, for which stress exposure
   is an established risk factor. Yet, so far, little is known about the
   effect of stress in the architecture of RSNs, both in resting state
   conditions or during shift to task performance. Herein we assessed the
   architecture of the RSNs using functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) in a cohort of participants exposed to prolonged stress
   (participants that had just finished their long period of preparation
   for the medical residence selection exam), and respective gender-and
   age-matched controls (medical students under normal academic
   activities). Analysis focused on the pattern of activity in resting
   state conditions and after deactivation. A volumetric estimation of the
   RSNs was also performed. Data shows that stressed participants displayed
   greater activation of the default mode (DMN), dorsal attention (DAN),
   ventral attention (VAN), sensorimotor (SMN), and primary visual (VN)
   networks than controls. Importantly, stressed participants also
   evidenced impairments in the deactivation of resting state-networks when
   compared to controls. These functional changes are paralleled by a
   constriction of the DMN that is in line with the pattern of brain
   atrophy observed after stress exposure. These results reveal that stress
   impacts on activation-deactivation pattern of RSNs, a finding that may
   underlie stress-induced changes in several dimensions of brain activity.}},

Abstract = {{Emotional changes are common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
   Alzheimer's disease (AD). Intrinsic connectivity imaging studies suggest
   that default mode network degradation in AD is accompanied by the
   release of an emotion-relevant salience network. We investigated whether
   emotional contagion, an evolutionarily conserved affect-sharing
   mechanism, is higher in MCI and AD secondary to biological alterations
   in neural networks that support emotion. We measured emotional contagion
   in 237 participants (111 healthy controls, 62 patients with MCI, and 64
   patients with AD) with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index Personal
   Distress subscale. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Geriatric
   Depression Scale. Participants underwent structural MRI, and voxel-based
   morphometry was used to relate whole-brain maps to emotional contagion.
   Analyses of covariance found significantly higher emotional contagion at
   each stage of disease progression {[}controls < MCI (P < 0.01) and MCI <
   AD (P < 0.001)]. Depressive symptoms were also higher in patients
   compared with controls {[}controls < MCI (P < 0.01) and controls < AD (P
   < 0.0001)]. Higher emotional contagion (but not depressive symptoms) was
   associated with smaller volume in right inferior, middle, and superior
   temporal gyri (P-FWE < 0.05); right temporal pole, anterior hippocampus,
   parahippocampal gyrus; and left middle temporal gyrus (all P < 0.001,
   uncorrected). These findings suggest that in MCI and AD,
   neurodegeneration of temporal lobe structures important for affective
   signal detection and emotion inhibition are associated with
   up-regulation of emotion-generating mechanisms. Emotional contagion, a
   quantifiable index of empathic reactivity that is present in other
   species, may be a useful tool with which to study emotional alterations
   in animal models of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an impaired form of
   associative memory, recollection, that includes the controlled retrieval
   of associations. In contrast, familiarity-based memory for individual
   items may sometimes be preserved in the early stages of the disease.
   This is the first study that directly examines whole-brain regional
   activity during one core aspect of the recollection function:
   associative controlled episodic retrieval.(CER), contrasted to item
   familiarity in AD patients. Cerebral activity related to associative CER
   and item familiarity in AD patients and healthy controls (HCs) was
   measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a word-pair
   recognition task to which the process dissociation procedure was
   applied. Some patients had null CER. estimates (AD), whereas others did
   show some CER abilities (AD+), although significantly less than HC. In
   contrast, familiarity estimates were equivalent in the three groups. In
   AD+, as in Controls, associative CER activated the inferior
   precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). When performing group
   comparisons, no region was found to be significantly more activated
   during CER in HC than AD+ and vice versa. However, during associative
   CER, functional connectivity between this region and the hippocampus,
   the inferior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was
   significantly higher in HC than in AD+. In all three groups, item
   familiarity was related to activation along the intraparietal sulcus
   (IFS). In conclusion, whereas the preserved automatic detection of an
   old item (without retrieval of accurate word association) is related to
   parietal activation centred on the IFS, the inferior precuneus/PCC
   supports associative CER ability in AD patients, as in HC. However, AD
   patients have deficient functional connectivity during associative GER,
   suggesting that the residual recollection function in these patients
   might be impoverished by the lack of some recollection-related aspects
   such as autonoetic quality, episodic details and verification. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{This project aimed to investigate the metabolic basis for resilience to
   neurodegeneration (cognitive reserve) in highly educated patients with
   prodromal Alzheimer disease (AD). Methods: Sixty-four patients with
   amnestic mild cognitive impairment who later converted to AD dementia
   during follow-up, and 90 controls, underwent brain F-18-FDG PET. Both
   groups were divided into a poorly educated subgroup (42 controls and 36
   prodromal AD patients) and a highly educated subgroup (48 controls and
   28 prodromal AD patients). Brain metabolism was first compared between
   education-matched groups of patients and controls. Then, metabolism was
   compared between highly and poorly educated prodromal AD patients in
   both directions to identify regions of high education-related metabolic
   depression and compensation. The clusters of significant depression and
   compensation were further used as volumetric regions of interest (ROIs)
   in a brain interregional correlation analysis in each prodromal AD
   subgroup to explore metabolic connectivity. All analyses were performed
   by means of SPM8 (P < 0.001 uncorrected at peak level, P < 0.05 false
   discovery rate-corrected at cluster level; age, sex, Mini-Mental State
   Examination score, and center as nuisance). Results: Highly educated
   prodromal AD patients showed more severe hypometabolism than poorly
   educated prodromal AD patients in the left inferior and middle temporal
   gyri and the left middle occipital gyrus (ROI depression). Conversely,
   they showed relative hypermetabolism in the right inferior, middle, and
   superior frontal gyri (ROI compensation). The sites of compensation,
   mainly corresponding to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC),
   showed wide metabolic correlations with several cortical areas in both
   hemispheres (frontotemporal cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and
   precuneus) in highly educated prodromal AD patients but not in poorly
   educated prodromal AD patients. To provide evidence on whether these
   metabolic correlations represent preservation of the physiologic
   networks of highly educated control subjects (neural reserve) or rather
   the recruitment of alternative networks (neural compensation), or a
   combination of the two, we performed metabolic connectivity analysis of
   the DLFC in highly educated controls as well. The correlation sites of
   right DLFC partly overlapped those of highly educated prodromal AD
   patients but were less extended. Conclusion: The present findings
   suggest that highly educated prodromal AD patients can cope better with
   the disease thanks to neural reserve but also to the recruitment of
   compensatory neural networks in which the right DLFC plays a key role.}},

Abstract = {{Neural networks supporting memory function decline with increasing age.
   Accumulation of amyloid-, a histopathological finding in Alzheimers
   disease, is a likely contributor. Posteromedial cortices (PMCs) are

   both encoding and retrieval processes. The extent to which aging and
   amyloid influence the ability to modulate activity between these
   processes within the PMC was investigated by combining positron emission
   tomography-amyloid imaging with functional magnetic resonance imaging in
   cognitively normal older and young adults. Young subjects exhibited a
   marked decrease in activity during encoding and an increase during
   retrieval (also known as encoding/retrieval flip). Impaired ability to
   modulate activity was associated with increasing age, greater amyloid
   burden, and worse memory performance. In contrast, the hippocampus
   showed increased activity during both encoding and retrieval, which was
   not related to these variables. These findings support a specific link

Abstract = {{There is increasing attention about the role of the thalamus in high
   cognitive functions, including memory. Although the bulk of the evidence
   refers to episodic memory, it was recently proposed that the mediodorsal
   (MD) and the centromedian-parafascicular (CM-Pf) nuclei of the thalamus
   may process general operations supporting memory performance, not only
   episodic memory. This perspective agrees with other recent fMRI findings
   on semantic retrieval in healthy participants. It can therefore be
   hypothesized that lesions to the MD and the CM-Pf impair semantic
   retrieval. In this study, 10 patients with focal ischemic lesions in the
   medial thalamus and 10 healthy controls matched for age, education, and
   verbal IQ performed a verbal semantic retrieval task. Patients were
   assigned to a target clinical group and a control clinical group based
   on lesion localization. Patients did not suffer from aphasia and
   performed in the range of controls in a categorization and a semantic
   association task. However, target patients performed poorer than healthy
   controls on semantic retrieval. The deficit was not because of higher
   distractibility but of an increased rate of false recall and, in some
   patients, of a considerably increased rate of misses. The latter deficit
   yielded a striking difference between the target and the control
   clinical groups and is consistent with anomia. Follow-up high-resolution
   structural scanning session in a subsample of patients revealed that
   lesions in the CM-Pf and MD were primarily associated with semantic
   retrieval deficits. We conclude that integrity of the MD and the CM-Pf
   is required for semantic retrieval, possibly because of their role in
   the activation of phonological representations.}},

Abstract = {{Measurements of blood flow in the human hippocampus are complicated by
   its relatively small size, unusual anatomy and patterns of blood supply.
   Only a handful of arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI articles have
   reported regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) values for the human
   hippocampus. Numerous reports have found heterogeneity in a number of
   other physiological and biochemical parameters along the longitudinal
   hippocampal axis. There is, however, only one ASL study of perfusion
   properties as a function of anteroposterior location in the hippocampus,
   reporting that rCBF is lower and the arterial transit time (ATT) is
   longer in the anterior hippocampus than in the posterior hippocampus of
   the rat brain. The purpose of this article was to measure ATT and rCBF
   in anterior, middle and posterior normal adult human hippocampus. To
   better distinguish anteroposterior perfusion heterogeneity in the
   hippocampus, a modified ASL method, called Orthogonally Positioned
   Tagging Imaging Method for Arterial Labeling with Flow-sensitive
   Alternating Inversion Recovery (OPTIMAL FAIR), was developed that
   provides high in-plane resolution with oblique coronal imaging slices
   perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus to minimize partial
   volume effects. Perfusion studies performed with this modified FAIR
   method at 3T indicated that anterior, middle and posterior human
   hippocampus segments have unique transit time and rCBF values. Of these
   three longitudinal hippocampal regions, the middle hippocampus has the
   highest perfusion and the shortest transit time and the anterior
   hippocampus has the lowest perfusion and the longest transit time.

Abstract = {{Automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) processing
   pipelines and different multivariate techniques are gaining popularity
   for Alzheimer's disease (AD) research. We used four supervised learning
   methods to classify AD patients and controls (CTL) and to prospectively
   predict the conversion of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD from
   baseline MRI data. A total of 345 participants from the AddNeuroMed
   cohort were included in this study; 116 AD patients, 119 MCI patients
   and 110 CTL individuals. High resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets
   were acquired and MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer. We explored
   the classification ability of orthogonal projections to latent
   structures (OPLS), decision trees (Trees), artificial neural networks
   (ANN) and support vector machines (SVM). Applying 10-fold
   cross-validation demonstrated that SVM and OPLS were slightly superior
   to Trees and ANN, although not statistically significant for
   distinguishing between AD and CTL. The classification experiments
   resulted in up to 83\% sensitivity and 87\% specificity for the best
   techniques. For the prediction of conversion of MCI patients at baseline
   to AD at 1-year follow-up, we obtained an accuracy of up to 86\%. The
   value of the multivariate models derived from the classification of AD
   vs. CTL was shown to be robust and efficient in the identification of
   MCI converters. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Image segmentation consists in partitioning an image into different
   regions. MRI image segmentation is especially interesting, since an
   accurate segmentation of the different brain tissues provides a way to
   identify many brain disorders such as dementia, schizophrenia or even
   the Alzheimer's disease. A large variety of image segmentation
   approaches have been implemented before. Nevertheless, most of them use
   a priori knowledge about the voxel classification, which prevents
   figuring out other tissue classes different from the classes the system
   was trained for. This paper presents two unsupervised approaches for
   brain image segmentation. The first one is based on the use of relevant
   information extracted from the whole volume histogram which is processed
   by using self-organizing maps (SOM). This approach is faster and
   computationally more efficient than previously reported methods. The
   second method proposed consists of four stages including MRI brain image
   acquisition, first and second order feature extraction using overlapping
   windows, evolutionary computing-based feature selection and finally, map
   units are grouped by means of a novel SOM clustering algorithm. While
   the first method is a fast procedure for the segmentation of the whole
   volume and provides a way to model tissue classes, the second approach
   is a more robust scheme under noisy or bad intensity normalization
   conditions that provides better results using high resolution images,
   outperforming the results provided by other algorithms in the
   state-of-the-art, in terms of the average overlap metric. The proposed
   algorithms have been successfully evaluated using the IBSR and IBSR 2.0
   databases, as well as high-resolution MR images from the Nuclear
   Medicine Department of the ``Virgen de las Nieves{''} Hospital, Granada,
   Spain (VNH), providing in any case good segmentation results. (C) 2012

Abstract = {{Amyloid imaging studies of presymptomatic familial Alzheimer's disease
   have revealed the striatum and thalamus to be the earliest sites of
   amyloid deposition. This study aimed to investigate whether there are
   associated volume and diffusivity changes in these subcortical
   structures during the presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of familial
   Alzheimer's disease. As the thalamus and striatum are involved in neural
   networks subserving complex cognitive and behavioural functions, we also
   examined the diffusion characteristics in connecting white matter
   tracts. A cohort of 20 presenilin 1 mutation carriers underwent
   volumetric and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging,
   neuropsychological and clinical assessments; 10 were symptomatic, 10
   were presymptomatic and on average 5.6 years younger than their expected
   age at onset; 20 healthy control subjects were also studied. We
   conducted region of interest analyses of volume and diffusivity changes
   in the thalamus, caudate, putamen and hippocampus and examined diffusion
   behaviour in the white matter tracts of interest (fornix, cingulum and
   corpus callosum). Voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial
   statistics were also used to provide unbiased whole-brain analyses of
   group differences in volume and diffusion indices, respectively. We
   found that reduced volumes of the left thalamus and bilateral caudate
   were evident at a presymptomatic stage, together with increased
   fractional anisotropy of bilateral thalamus and left caudate. Although
   no significant hippocampal volume loss was evident presymptomatically,
   reduced mean diffusivity was observed in the right hippocampus and
   reduced mean and axial diffusivity in the right cingulum. In contrast,
   symptomatic mutation carriers showed increased mean, axial and in
   particular radial diffusivity, with reduced fractional anisotropy, in
   all of the white matter tracts of interest. The symptomatic group also
   showed atrophy and increased mean diffusivity in all of the subcortical
   grey matter regions of interest, with increased fractional anisotropy in
   bilateral putamen. We propose that axonal injury may be an early event
   in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease, causing an initial fall in axial
   and mean diffusivity, which then increases with loss of axonal density.
   The selective degeneration of long-coursing white matter tracts, with
   relative preservation of short interneurons, may account for the
   increase in fractional anisotropy that is seen in the thalamus and
   caudate presymptomatically. It may be owing to their dense connectivity
   that imaging changes are seen first in the thalamus and striatum, which
   then progress to involve other regions in a vulnerable neuronal network.}},

   brain-wide neural networks, eventually leading to epileptogenesis. We
   examined electroencephalograms (EEGs) and auditory-evoked potentials
   (AEPs) in freely moving 4-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 (APdE9) and wild-type
   (WT) control mice in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, and thalamus

   than in WT mice over a broad frequency range (5-100 Hz) and during all 4
   behavioral states. Thalamic EEG power was also increased but in a
   narrower range (10-80 Hz). Furthermore, APdE9 mice displayed augmented
   cortical and thalamic AEPs. While power and theta gamma modulation were
   preserved in the APdE9 hippocampus, REM sleep-related phase shift of
   theta-gamma modulation was altered. Our data suggest that at the early

Abstract = {{Background: The functional neural network model has been a major method
   used to investigate mechanisms of neuropsychopathy. There is
   considerable evidence that late-onset depression (LOD) is the prodrome,
   or the early clinical manifestation, of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The
   default mode network (DMN) is one of the neural networks that can be
   used to explore the complex relationships between depressive symptoms,
   episodic memory deficits and other cognitive impairments. To date, no
   study has directly linked the DMN to LOD while focusing on episodic
   memory and the influence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a major genetic
   risk factor for AD in LOD patients.
   Methods: In total, 33 remitted LOD (rLOD) patients and 33 elderly
   controls underwent fMRI scanning using low-frequency BOLD signal imaging
   during the resting state and during an episodic memory task.
   Furthermore, function-based functional connectivities (FCs) in the
   region of interesting (ROI) (posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) of the
   DMN) were analysed to explore interactions between disease states, task
   states and genetic risk factors (APOE4).
   Results: Compared to healthy control subjects (HC), the FCs between the
   PCC and the right medial temporal lobe of the rLOD patients were
   significantly stronger during rest (p<0.005) and significantly weaker
   (p<0.05) during performance of the task. The mode of change from rest to
   task performance in the HC was in contrast to the mode of change in the
   rLOD patients. The FCs of the rLOD patients without APOE4 were
   significantly increased (p<0.05) in the resting state, but the rLOD
   patients who carried APOE4 showed a trend toward decreased FCs.
   Limitations: The sample size was small. While the study was
   cross-sectional, we did not differentiate between the various types of
   antidepressants the patients used, which may have had different effects
   on cognitive function, especially on episodic memory.
   Conclusion: Our results suggested that rLOD might be the prodrome, or
   the early clinical manifestation, of AD and that rLOD patients with
   APOE4 showed an increased risk for episodic memory decline and AD. (C)

Abstract = {{An electroencephalogram (EEG) analysis system is proposed for
   single-trial classification of motor imagery (MI) data in this study.
   Applying event-related brain potential (ERP) data acquired from the
   sensorimotor cortices, the system mainly consists of enhanced active
   segment selection, feature extraction, feature selection and
   classification. In addition to the original use of continuous wavelet
   transform (CWT) and Student's two-sample t-statistics, the 2D
   anisotropic Gaussian filter is proposed to further refine the selection
   of active segments. We then extract several features, including spectral
   power and asymmetry ratio, coherence and phase-locking value, and
   multiresolution fractal feature vector, for subsequent classification.
   Next, genetic algorithm (GA) is used to select features from the
   combination of above-mentioned features. Finally, support vector machine
   (SVM) is used for classification. Compared with ``without enhanced
   active segment selection,{''} several potential features and linear
   discriminant analysis (LDA) on MI data from two data sets for 10
   subjects, the results indicate that the proposed method achieves 86.7\%
   average classification accuracy, which is promising in BCI applications.}},

Abstract = {{Much controversy has been focused on the extent to which the amygdala
   belongs to the autobiographical memory (AM) core network. Early evidence
   suggested the amygdala played a vital role in emotional processing,
   likely helping to encode emotionally charged stimuli. However, recent
   work has highlighted the amygdala's role in social and self-referential
   processing, leading to speculation that the amygdala likely supports the
   encoding and retrieval of AM. Here, cognitive as well as structural and
   functional magnetic resonance imaging data was collected from an
   extremely rare individual with near-perfect AM, or hyperthymesia. Right
   amygdala hypertrophy (approximately 20\%) and enhanced
   amygdala-to-hippocampus connectivity (>10 SDs) was observed in this
   volunteer relative to controls. Based on these findings and previous
   literature, we speculate that the amygdala likely charges AMs with
   emotional, social, and self-relevance. In heightened memory, this system
   may be hyperactive, allowing for many types of autobiographical
   information, including emotionally benign, to be more efficiently
   processed as self-relevant for encoding and storage.}},

Abstract = {{Numerous neuroimaging studies have implicated default mode network (DMN)
   involvement in both internally driven processes and memory.
   Nevertheless, it is unclear whether memory operations reflect a
   particular case of internally driven processing or alternatively involve
   the DMN in a distinct manner, possibly depending on memory type. This
   question is critical for refining neurocognitive memory theorem in the
   context of other endogenic processes and elucidating the functional
   significance of this key network. We used functional MRI to examine DMN
   activity and connectivity patterns while participants overtly generated
   words according to nonmnemonic (phonemic) or mnemonic (semantic or
   episodic) cues. Overall, mnemonic word fluency was found to elicit
   greater DMN activity and stronger within-network functional connectivity
   compared with nonmnemonic fluency. Furthermore, two levels of functional
   organization of memory retrieval were shown. First, across both mnemonic
   tasks, activity was greater mainly in the posterior cingulate cortex,
   implying selective contribution to generic aspects of memory beyond its
   general involvement in endogenous processes. Second, parts of the DMN
   showed distinct selectivity for each of the mnemonic conditions; greater
   recruitment of the anterior prefrontal cortex, retroesplenial cortex,
   and hippocampi and elevated connectivity between anterior and posterior
   medial DMN nodes characterized the semantic condition, whereas increased
   recruitment of posterior DMN components and elevated connectivity
   between them characterized the episodic condition. This finding
   emphasizes the involvement of DMN elements in discrete aspects of memory
   retrieval. Altogether, our results show a specific contribution of the
   DMN to memory processes, corresponding to the specific type of memory
   retrieval.}},

Abstract = {{Recent studies suggest that a complex, distributed neural network
   underpins semantic cognition. This article reviews our contribution to
   this emerging picture and traces the putative roles of each region
   within this network. Neuropsychological studies indicate that semantic
   cognition draws on at least two interacting components: semantic
   representations {[}degraded in semantic dementia (SD)] and control
   processes {[}deficient in patients with multimodal semantic impairment
   following stroke aphasia (SA)]. To explore the first component, we
   employed distortion-corrected functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI) and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy
   volunteers: these studies convergently indicated that the anterior
   temporal lobes (ATLs; atrophied in SD) combine information from
   different modalities within an amodal semantic ``hub{''}. Regions of
   cortex that code specific semantic features ({''}spokes{''}) also make a
   critical contribution to knowledge within particular categories. This
   network of brain regions interacts with semantic control processes
   reliant on left inferior frontal gyrus (LIFG), posterior middle temporal
   gyrus (pMTG) and inferior parietal cortices. SA patients with damage to
   these regions have difficulty focussing on aspects of knowledge that are
   relevant to the current goal or context, in both verbal and non-verbal
   tasks. SA patients with LIFG and temporoparietal lesions show similar
   deficits of semantic control, suggesting that a large-scale distributed
   cortical network underpins semantic control. Convergent evidence is
   again provided by fMRI and TMS. We separately manipulated the
   representational and control demands of a semantic task in fMRI, and
   found a dissociation within the temporal lobe: ATL was sensitive to the
   number of meanings retrieved, while pMTG and LIFG showed effects of
   semantic selection. Moreover, TMS to LIFG and pMTG produced equal
   disruption of tasks tapping semantic control. The next challenges are to
   delineate the specific roles of each region within the semantic control
   network and to specify the way in which control processes interact with
   semantic representations to focus processing on relevant features of
   concepts. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

Abstract = {{Category-specific deficits have rarely been reported in semantic

   documented category-specific deficits, and these have focused on the

   a category-specific effect could be highlighted by a semantic sorting
   task administered to 35 SD patients once at baseline and again after 2
   years and to 10 Alzheimer's disease patients (AD). We found a relative
   preservation of fruit and vegetables only in SD.
   This relative preservation of fruit and vegetables could be considered
   with regard to the importance of color knowledge in their
   discrimination. Indeed, color knowledge retrieval is known to depend on
   the left posterior fusiform gyrus which is relatively spared in SD.
   Finally, according to predictions of semantic memory models, our
   findings best fitted the Devlin and Gonnerman's computational account.

Abstract = {{The medial temporal lobes (MTL) and frontal cortex have been shown to

   Alzheimer's disease (AD), disrupt the neuronal networks that underlie

   a genetic risk factor for AD and is associated with decrements in memory
   and in olfactory function. The present study utilized EQS, a structural
   equation modeling software program, to examine differences in the
   neuronal networks between non-demented epsilon 4 carriers and epsilon 4
   noncarriers during a cross-modal olfactory recognition memory paradigm.
   Prior to fMRI scanning, participants were presented with 16 odors.
   During two scans, participants discriminated between names of odors
   presented before scanning (targets) or not presented (foils). The
   results indicate significant connections between bilateral frontal lobes
   and MTL for epsilon 4 carriers when they misidentified a foil as a
   target. When epsilon 4 noncarriers correctly identified a target, there
   were greater associations between the amygdala, MTL, and right frontal
   lobe; these associations also modeled the brain's response when epsilon
   4 noncarriers misidentified a foil as a target. During memory retrieval,
   affective cues may facilitate retrieval in epsilon 4 noncarriers

Abstract = {{Patients with Alzheimer's disease have category-specific semantic memory
   difficulty for natural relative to manufactured objects. We assessed the
   basis for this deficit by asking healthy adults and patients to judge
   whether pairs of words share a feature (e.g. ``banana:lemon-COLOR{''}).
   In an fMRI study, healthy adults showed gray matter (GM) activation of
   temporal-occipital cortex (TOC) where visual-perceptual features may be
   represented, and prefrontal cortex (PFC) which may contribute to feature
   selection. Tractography revealed dorsal and ventral stream white matter
   (WM) projections between PFC and TOC. Patients had greater difficulty
   with natural than manufactured objects. This was associated with greater
   overlap between diseased GM areas correlated with natural kinds in
   patients and fMRI activation in healthy adults for natural kinds. The
   dorsal WM projection between PFC and TOC in patients correlated only
   with judgments of natural kinds. Patients thus remained dependent on the
   same neural network as controls during judgments of natural kinds,
   despite disease in these areas. For manufactured objects, patients'
   judgments showed limited correlations with PFC and TOC GM areas
   activated by controls, and did not correlate with the PFC-TOC dorsal WM
   tract. Regions outside of the PFC-TOC network thus may help support
   patients' judgments of manufactured objects. We conclude that a
   large-scale neural network for semantic memory implicates both feature
   knowledge representations in modality-specific association cortex and
   heteromodal regions important for accessing this knowledge, and that
   patients' relative deficit for natural kinds is due in part to their
   dependence on this network despite disease in these areas. (C) 2012

Title = {{Auditory cortical function during verbal episodic memory encoding in

Volume = {{73}},

Abstract = {{Objective Episodic memory encoding of a verbal message depends upon
   initial registration, which requires sustained auditory attention
   followed by deep semantic processing of the message. Motivated by
   previous data demonstrating modulation of auditory cortical activity
   during sustained attention to auditory stimuli, we investigated the
   response of the human auditory cortex during encoding of sentences to
   episodic memory. Subsequently, we investigated this response in patients
   with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and probable Alzheimer's disease
   (pAD). Methods Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, 31 healthy
   participants were studied. The response in 18 MCI and 18 pAD patients
   was then determined, and compared to 18 matched healthy controls.
   Subjects heard factual sentences, and subsequent retrieval performance
   indicated successful registration and episodic encoding. Results The
   healthy subjects demonstrated that suppression of auditory cortical
   responses was related to greater success in encoding heard sentences;
   and that this was also associated with greater activity in the semantic
   system. In contrast, there was reduced auditory cortical suppression in
   patients with MCI, and absence of suppression in pAD. Administration of
   a central cholinesterase inhibitor (ChI) partially restored the
   suppression in patients with pAD, and this was associated with an
   improvement in verbal memory. Interpretation Verbal episodic memory
   impairment in AD is associated with altered auditory cortical function,
   reversible with a ChI. Although these results may indicate the direct
   influence of pathology in auditory cortex, they are also likely to
   indicate a partially reversible impairment of feedback from neocortical
   systems responsible for sustained attention and semantic processing. ANN

Abstract = {{The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the human
   hippocampus in episodic retrieval of odors, in comparison with episodic
   retrieval of visual objects. Subjects encoded a set of unique odors and
   objects, and retrieval was tested the next day during functional
   magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Subjects were shown the names of old
   (studied) and new (unstudied) odors and objects, and asked to indicate
   which of these stimuli had been presented the previous day. The results
   showed that brain activation was weaker and more restricted during
   retrieval of odors than during retrieval of objects, which possibly
   reflects a general visual dominance effect. Yet, retrieval of odors and
   objects yielded overlapping clusters of activation the bilateral
   hippocampi, and the left-sided activation was specifically increased
   during successful retrieval (hits > correct rejections) in both
   modalities. Moreover, retrieval of odors uniquely activated olfactory
   cortical regions, likely to reflect cortical reinstatement of sensory
   details. Our fMRI study is the first to make a direct comparison between
   olfactory and visual episodic memory, and the results provide clear
   evidence for modality-independent functions of the hippocampus. (C) 2012

Journal = {{IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON NEURAL NETWORKS AND LEARNING SYSTEMS}},
Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{24}},
Number = {{2}},

Month = {{FEB}},
Abstract = {{In this paper, we present a sequential projection-based metacognitive
   learning algorithm in a radial basis function network (PBL-McRBFN) for
   classification problems. The algorithm is inspired by human
   metacognitive learning principles and has two components: a cognitive
   component and a metacognitive component. The cognitive component is a
   single-hidden-layer radial basis function network with evolving
   architecture. The metacognitive component controls the learning process
   in the cognitive component by choosing the best learning strategy for
   the current sample and adapts the learning strategies by implementing
   self-regulation. In addition, sample overlapping conditions and past
   knowledge of the samples in the form of pseudosamples are used for
   proper initialization of new hidden neurons to minimize the
   misclassification. The parameter update strategy uses projection-based
   direct minimization of hinge loss error. The interaction of the
   cognitive component and the metacognitive component addresses the
   what-to-learn, when-to-learn, and how-to-learn human learning principles
   efficiently. The performance of the PBL-McRBFN is evaluated using a set
   of benchmark classification problems from the University of California
   Irvine machine learning repository. The statistical performance
   evaluation on these problems proves the superior performance of the
   PBL-McRBFN classifier over results reported in the literature. Also, we
   evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm on a practical
   Alzheimer's disease detection problem. The performance results on open
   access series of imaging studies and Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging
   initiative datasets, which are obtained from different demographic
   regions, clearly show that PBL-McRBFN can handle a problem with change
   in distribution.}},

Abstract = {{Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with early memory loss,
   Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology, inefficient or ineffective
   neural processing, and increased risk for AD. Unfortunately, treatments
   aimed at improving clinical symptoms or markers of brain function
   generally have been of limited value. Physical exercise is often
   recommended for people diagnosed with MCI, primarily because of its
   widely reported cognitive benefits in healthy older adults. However, it
   is unknown if exercise actually benefits brain function during memory
   retrieval in MCI. Here, we examined the effects of exercise training on
   semantic memory activation during functional magnetic resonance imaging
   (fMRI). Seventeen MCI participants and 18 cognitively intact controls,
   similar in sex, age, education, genetic risk, and medication use,
   volunteered for a 12-week exercise intervention consisting of supervised
   treadmill walking at a moderate intensity. Both MCI and control
   participants significantly increased their cardiorespiratory fitness by
   approximately 10\% on a treadmill exercise test. Before and after the
   exercise intervention, participants completed an fMRI famous name
   discrimination task and a neuropsychological battery, Performance on
   Trial 1 of a list-learning task significantly improved in the MCI
   participants. Eleven brain regions activated during the semantic memory
   task showed a significant decrease in activation intensity following the
   intervention that was similar between groups (p-values ranged 0.048 to
   0.0001). These findings suggest exercise may improve neural efficiency
   during semantic memory retrieval in MCI and cognitively intact older
   adults, and may lead to improvement in cognitive function. Clinical
   trials are needed to determine if exercise is effective to delay
   conversion to AD.}},

Pages = {{643-668}},
Abstract = {{Progress is being made in identifying possible pathogenic factors and
   novel genes in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Many of
   these could contribute to `slow excitotoxicity', defined as neuronal
   loss due to overexcitation as a consequence of decreased energy
   production due, for instance, to changes in insulin receptor signaling;
   or receptor abnormalities, such as tau-induced alterations in
   N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor phosphorylation. As a result,
   glutamate becomes neurotoxic at concentrations that normally show no
   toxicity. In AD, NMDA receptors are overexcited by glutamate in a tonic,
   rather than a phasic manner. Moreover, in prodromal AD subjects,
   functional MRI reveals an increase in neural network activities relative
   to baseline, rather than loss of activity. This may be an attempt to
   compensate for reduced number of neurons, or reflect ongoing slow
   excitotoxicity. This article reviews possible links between AD
   pathogenic factors such as A beta PP/A beta and tau; novel risk genes
   including clusterin, phosphatidylinositol-binding clathrin assembly
   protein, complement receptor 1, bridging integrator 1, ATP-binding
   cassette transporter 7, membrane-spanning 4-domains subfamily A,
   CD2-associated protein, sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin,
   and ephrin receptor A1; metabolic changes including insulin resistance
   and hypercholesterolemia; lipid changes including alterations in brain
   phospholipids, cholesterol and ceramides; glial changes affecting
   microglia and astrocytes; alterations in brain iron metallome and
   oxidative stress; and slow excitotoxicity. Better understanding of the
   possible molecular links between pathogenic factors and slow
   excitotoxicity could inform our understanding of the disease, and pave
   the way towards new therapeutic strategies for AD.}},

Year = {{2013}},
Volume = {{59}},
Number = {{2}},
Pages = {{143-151}},
Abstract = {{Recent research has demonstrated commonalities between remembering past
   events and imagining future events. Behavioral studies have revealed
   that remembering the past and imagining the future depend on shared
   cognitive processes, whereas neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies
   have shown that many of the same brain regions are involved in both
   remembering the past and imagining the future. Here, we review recent
   cognitive and neuroimaging studies that examine remembering the past and
   imagining the future in elderly adults. These studies document
   significant changes in elderly adults' capacities to imagine future
   events that are correlated with their memory deficits; most strikingly,
   older adults tend to remember the past and imagine the future with less
   episodic detail than younger adults. These findings are in line with the
   constructive episodic simulation hypothesis {[}Schacter and Addis: Phil
   Trans R Soc B 2007;362:773-786], which holds that past and future events
   draw on similar information and rely on similar underlying processes,
   and that episodic memory supports the construction of future events by
   extracting and recombining stored information into a simulation of a
   novel event. At the same time, however, recent data indicate that
   non-episodic factors also contribute to age-related changes in
   remembering the past and imagining the future. We conclude by
   considering a number of questions and challenges concerning the
   interpretation of age-related changes in remembering and imagining, as
   well as functional implications of this research for everyday concerns
   of older adults. Copyright (c) 2012 S. Karger AG, Basel}},

Abstract = {{Normal aging and mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) are associated with
   declines in navigational skills, including allocentric and egocentric
   representations, cognitive mapping, landmark processing, and spatial
   memory. These changes, however, are associated with different patterns
   of structural and functional alterations in the neural network of
   navigation. In AD, these changes occur in the hippocampus,
   parahippocampal gyrus, parietal lobe, retrosplenial cortex, prefrontal
   cortex, and caudate nucleus, whereas in aging, modifications occur
   mainly in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. The navigation
   abilities of patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) have been
   found to show different performance patterns, depending on their
   cognitive profiles. Since patients with MCI do not uniformly develop
   dementia of the Alzheimer type, it is important to identify reliable
   early cognitive markers of conversion to AD dementia. In this review, we
   propose that navigation deficits may help distinguish patients at higher
   risk of developing AD dementia from individuals with normal cognitive
   aging and those with other neurodegenerative diseases. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {{Amyloid-beta (A beta) deposition in the brain is one of the key
   pathological features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Neither traditional
   clinical-pathological studies nor modern in vivo biomarker
   investigations of brain amyloid load, however, could reveal a convincing
   relationship between brain A beta load and cognitive deficits and
   decline in patients with AD. Evidence suggests that pathophysiological A
   beta dysregulation and accumulation are very early events that precede
   the onset of cognitive impairment reaching a plateau at the clinical
   stage of the beginning dementia syndrome. Therefore, research efforts
   have focused on the role of A beta in asymptomatic older adults: the
   results of combined amyloid-PET and neuropsychological studies show a
   modest but significant correlation between brain fibrillar amyloid load
   and various subtle cognitive deficits, most notably in challenging
   episodic associative memory tasks. In order to elucidate the
   pathophysiological link between cognition and A beta, a number of
   combined functional neuroimaging studies have been performed, resulting
   in early and complex functional alterations in cognitively relevant
   neural networks such as the default mode network and the largely
   overlapping episodic memory networks. Multimodal studies using
   amyloid-tracing imaging methods and neurodegeneration biomarkers
   strongly suggest that neural network discoordination is specifically
   related to A beta-mediated functional and potentially reversible
   disruption of synaptic plasticity rather than a direct consequence to
   neurodegenerative pathological processes. These pathophysiological
   processes and mechanisms may dynamically and non-linearly evolve through
   fully reversible adaptive compensatory stages and through reactive
   decompensatory stages into fully irreversible neurodegenerative stages
   of AD.}},

Abstract = {{Objective: To determine whether amyloid burden, as indexed by Pittsburgh
   compound B (PiB) retention, identifies patients with Parkinson disease
   with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) compared to those with normal
   cognition (PD-nl). A related aim is to determine whether amyloid burden
   predicts cognitive decline in a cohort of subjects with PD without
   dementia.
   Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we examined 46 subjects with
   PD without dementia, of whom 35 had normal cognition and 11 met criteria
   for PD-MCI at study baseline. All subjects underwent standardized
   neurologic and neuropsychological examinations and PiB PET at baseline,
   and clinical examinations were conducted annually for up to 5 years.
   Results: At baseline, precuneus PiB retention did not distinguish PD-MCI
   from PD-nl. Subjects with PD-MCI declined more rapidly than PD-nl
   subjects on cognitive tests of memory, executive function, and
   activation retrieval. Of the 35 PD-nl subjects, 8 progressed to PD-MCI
   and 1 to dementia; of the 11 PD-MCI subjects, 5 converted to dementia.
   Both higher PiB retention and a diagnosis of PD-MCI predicted a greater
   hazard of conversion to a more severe diagnosis. Baseline PiB retention
   predicted worsening in executive function over time. The APOE epsilon 4
   allele also related to worsening in executive function, as well as
   visuospatial function, activation retrieval, and performance on the
   Mini-Mental State Examination. In contrast to its relation to cognitive
   decline, PiB retention did not affect progression of motor impairment.
   Conclusions: At baseline measurements, amyloid burden does not
   distinguish between cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects with PD
   without dementia, but our data suggest that amyloid contributes to
   cognitive, but not motor, decline over time. Neurology (R) 2013;80:85-91}},

   Images (MRI) using a proposed ` sequential Projection Based Learning for
   Meta-cognitive q-Gaussian Radial Basis Function Network (PBL-McqRBFN)'
   classifier. The McqRBFN has two components, namely, a cognitive
   component and a meta-cognitive components. The cognitive component is a
   single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with a
   q-Gaussian activation function, that allows different RBF's in one
   network, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy
   functions, by changing a real q-parameter. The meta-cognitive component
   present in McqRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on
   its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McqRBFN
   employs a sequential Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm to reduce
   the computational effort used in training.
   For simulation studies, we have used MRI data from the Alzheimer's
   Disease Neuroimaging Initiative database. Voxel Based Morphometry (VBM)
   is used for feature extraction from MRI data and extracted VBM features
   are fed into the PBLMcqRBFN classifier. The experimental results show

Abstract = {{We aimed to develop a new method to convert T1-weighted brain MRIs to
   feature vectors, which could be used for content-based image retrieval
   (CBIR). To overcome the wide range of anatomical variability in clinical
   cases and the inconsistency of imaging protocols, we introduced the
   Gross feature recognition of Anatomical Images based on Atlas grid
   (GAIA), in which the local intensity alteration, caused by pathological
   (e. g., ischemia) or physiological (development and aging) intensity
   changes, as well as by atlas-image misregistration, is used to capture
   the anatomical features of target images.
   As a proof-of-concept, the GAIA was applied for pattern recognition of
   the neuroanatomical features of multiple stages of Alzheimer's disease,
   Huntington's disease, spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, and four subtypes
   of primary progressive aphasia. For each of these diseases, feature
   vectors based on a training dataset were applied to a test dataset to
   evaluate the accuracy of pattern recognition. The feature vectors
   extracted from the training dataset agreed well with the known
   pathological hallmarks of the selected neurodegenerative diseases.
   Overall, discriminant scores of the test images accurately categorized
   these test images to the correct disease categories. Images without
   typical disease-related anatomical features were misclassified. The
   proposed method is a promising method for image feature extraction based
   on disease-related anatomical features, which should enable users to
   submit a patient image and search past clinical cases with similar

Abstract = {{Valid screening devices are critical for an early diagnosis of dementia.
   The DemTect is such an internationally accepted tool. We aimed to
   characterize the neural networks associated with performance on the
   DemTect's subtests in two frequent dementia syndromes: early Alzheimer's
   disease (AD) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Voxel-based
   group comparisons of cerebral glucose utilization (as measured by
   F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) and gray matter
   atrophy (as measured by structural magnetic resonance imaging) were
   performed on data from 48 subjects with AD (n = 21), FTLD (n = 14) or
   subjective cognitive impairment (n = 13) as a control group. Weperformed
   group comparisons and correlation analyses between multimodal imaging
   data and performance on the DemTect's subtests. Group comparisons showed
   regional patterns consistent with previous findings for AD and FTLD.
   Interestingly, atrophy dominated in FTLD, whereas hypometabolism in AD.
   Across diagnostic groups performance on the ``wordlist{''} subtest was
   positively correlated with glucose metabolism in the left temporal lobe.
   The ``number transcoding{''} subtest was significantly associated with
   glucose metabolism in both a predominantly left lateralized
   frontotemporal network and a parietooccipital network including parts of
   the basal ganglia. Moreover, this subtest was associated with gray
   matter density in an extensive network including frontal, temporal,
   parietal and occipital areas. No significant correlates were observed
   for the ``supermarket task{''} subtest. Scores on the ``digit span
   reverse{''} subtest correlatedwith glucose metabolism in the left
   frontal cortex, the bilateral putamen, the head of caudate nucleus and
   the anterior insula. Disease-specific correlation analyses could partly
   verify or extend the correlates shown in the analyses across diagnostic
   groups. Correlates of gray matter density were found in FTLD for the
   ``number transcoding{''} subtest and the `` digit span reverse{''}
   subtest. Correlates of glucose metabolismwere found in AD for the
   ``wordlist{''} subtest and in FTLD for the `` digit span reverse{''}
   subtest. Our study contributes to the understanding of the neural
   correlates of cognitive deficits in AD and FTLD and supports an external
   validation of the DemTect providing preliminary conclusions about
   disease-specific correlates. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier
