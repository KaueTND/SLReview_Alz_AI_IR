Early diagnosis of dementia helps in finding suitable therapies that reduce or even prevent further deterioration of patients' cognitive abilities. In recent years, state-of-the-art literature has proposed various computer-aided diagnosis systems based on 3-dimensional brain imagery analysis to identify early symptoms of dementia. These systems aim to assist radiologists in increasing the accuracy of diagnoses and reducing false positives. However, the early diagnosis of dementia is a challenging task due to the image quality, noise, and human brain irregularities. The state-of-the-art has focused on differentiating multi-stages of Alzheimer's disease, however, the diagnosis of various types of dementia is still a gap. This paper proposes a deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis approach for the early detection of multi-type of dementia. To show the performance of the proposed CAD algorithm, three conventional CAD methods are implemented for comparison. The proposed algorithm yields a 74.93% accuracy in early diagnosis of multi-type of dementia and outperforms the state of the art CAD methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-2984-6; POD:978-1-5090-2985-3","10.1109/MeMeA.2017.7985847","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7985847","Alzheimer's disease;Brain imaging;Computer-Aided Diagnosis;Convolutional Neural Networks;Dementia;Early diagnosis;Magnetic Resonance Imaging","Brain;Dementia;Feature extraction;Image edge detection;Image segmentation;Magnetic resonance imaging","biomedical MRI;cognition;convolution;diseases;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology","Alzheimer disease;caregiver physical states;caregiveremotional states;convolutional neural networks;deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis approach;dementia;image quality;magnetic resonance imaging;patient cognitive abilities;three-dimensional brain imagery analysis","","","","","","","","7-10 May 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, automated search and retrieval of similar casesfrom large medical databases may especially improve diagnosis and treatment of diseases whose causes and effects have not yet been fully known. Database management systems used at clinical sites store textual information like name, age, and gender along with medical images. Accordingly, combined usage of image features (content) with demographic and clinical information (context) for similar case search may improve accuracy andreliability of diagnosis, and thus result in increased patient care and lower healthcare costs. In this study we explored the effect of content features extracted from magnetic resonance images and context features such as patient demographics and clinical data on similarity-based disease diagnosis.

In addition, because of the possibly heterogeneous property between the hand-crafted features and the subsequent model, existing methods may lead to sub-optimal performances in brain disease diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a landmark based deep feature learning (LDFL) framework to automatically extract patch-based representation from MRI for automatic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We first identify discriminative anatomical landmarks from MR images in a data-driven manner, and then propose a convolutional neural network (CNN) for patch-based deep feature learning. We have evaluated the proposed method on subjects from three public datasets, including the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI-1), ADNI-2, and the Minimal Interval Resonance Imaging in Alzheimer's Disease (MIRIAD) dataset.

In this paper, we present a robust deep learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection, an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis.

Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models, three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14% average accuracy.

In this study, Electroencephalography (EEG) data from seventeen subjects was used to determine if brain activity could be used to distinguish MCI with cognitively normal individuals and compare classification performance. Event-related brain potentials (ERP) were recorded in response to auditory speech stimuli. We extracted spectral and temporal features of the ERPs and built a MCI detection process with Support vector machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), and Random Forest (RF). We have compared behavioral response against EEG based time domain features, frequency domain features, and top-ranked features of time-frequency domains. Four feature groups of our study demonstrate that the ranked time and frequency domain features of the EEG perform better than behavioral features and other EEG/ERP response metrics. Our results demonstrate the performance of the detection of MCI with a cross-validation accuracy of 87.9%, sensitivity 85%, specificity 90%, and F-score 94%.

Though each area has its unique role, they do not operate separately. It is empirically known that during brain activity, different elements affect each other. Such neural network's activity is called Functional Brain Connectivity (FBC). It is a known phenomenon among athletes who suffer mild head injuries frequently along their career, to be more likely to suffer from neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's at old age. This phenomenon has been studied by physicians and health researchers as early as 1971 [1]. Patients who suffered from frequent mild head injuries have no neurological appearable symptoms at young age. FBC abnormality accompanies the mentioned neurological diseases, each characterizes with a different pattern [2], [3]. These two facts led the hypothesis that frequent head injuries can, with some probability, cause FBC abnormalities. Proving this hypothesis and mapping the transformed pattern of FBC can contribute to understanding neurological diseases and by this help the search after treatment generally and preventing for frequent mild injured athletes particularly. This work offers a technology that enables brain researchers to evaluate and locate abnormalities in FBC using fMRI data of a patient. It does so using the fact that connectivity pattern, at rest state, is to a large extent symmetrical. The system evaluates connectivity between classes of voxels using a new nonlinear-Differential Filtered Coherence. It is a mathematical solution for describing connections that are not necessary linear by following the influences of changes in one signal on the changes in another. Finally, the system finds FBC asymmetry using registration of the generated connectivity map between the two hemispheres of the brain.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5988-4; POD:978-1-4799-5989-1","10.1109/EEEI.2014.7005821","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7005821","Connectivity;DFC;FBC;Head Injuries;fMRI","Coherence;Correlation;Diseases;Educational institutions;Head;Injuries;Three-dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;diseases;image registration;injuries;medical image processing;neurophysiology;nonlinear filters","Alzheimer disease;FBC abnormality;Parkinson disease;athletes;brain activity;control system;fMRI data;fMRI image processing;functional brain connectivity abnormalities;functioning processing;generated connectivity map;head injured patients;hemispheres;mathematical solution;mild head injuries;neural elements;neural network activity;neurological appearable symptoms;neurological diseases;nonlinear differential filtered coherence;registration","","0","","5","","","","3-5 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) neuroimages are effective modalities that can help physicians to diagnose AD. In past few years, machine-learning algorithm have been widely studied on the analyses for multi-modality neuroimages in quantitation evaluation and computer-aided-diagnosis (CAD) of AD. Most existing methods extract the hand-craft features after image preprocessing such as registration, segmentation and feature extraction, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. This paper proposes to construct multi-level convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to gradually learn and combine the multi-modality features for AD classification using MRI and PET images. First, the deep 3D-CNNs are constructed to transform the whole brain information into compact high-level features for each modality. Then, a 2D CNNs is cascaded to ensemble the high-level features for image classification. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from MRI and PET imaging data for AD classification. No rigid image registration and segmentation are performed on the brain images. Our proposed method is evaluated on the baseline MRI and PET images from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database on 193 subjects including 93 Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects and 100 normal controls (NC) subjects.

Deep learning has recently been a great interest in AD classification. Previous works had done almost on single modality dataset, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET), shown high performances. However, identifying the distinctions between Alzheimer's brain data and healthy brain data in older adults (age > 75) is challenging due to highly similar brain patterns and image intensities. The corporation of multimodalities can solve this issue since it discovers and uses the further complementary of hidden biomarkers from other modalities instead of only one, which itself cannot provide. We therefore propose a deep learning method on fusion multimodalities. In details, our approach includes Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) and convolution neural network (CNN) train and test on combined PET-MRI data to diagnose the disease status of a patient. We focus on advantages of multimodalities to help providing complementary information than only one, lead to improve classification accuracy. We conducted experiments in a dataset of 1272 scans from ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 90% between AD patients and healthy controls, demonstrate the improvement than using only one modality.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3015-6; POD:978-1-5090-3016-3; USB:978-1-5090-3014-9","10.1109/BIGCOMP.2017.7881683","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7881683","Alzheimer's disease;MRI;PET;autoencoder;convolutional neural network;deep learning","Biological neural networks;Convolution;Feature extraction;Magnetic resonance imaging;Positron emission tomography;Support vector machines;Three-dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;convolution;diseases;image classification;image coding;image fusion;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neural nets;positron emission tomography","Alzheimer disease diagnosis;convolution neural network;deep learning method;image fusion multimodalities;magnetic resonance imaging;multimodal learning method;neuroimaging data;pattern recognition methods;positron emission tomography;sparse autoencoder","","","","","","","","13-16 Feb. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67 aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12% for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects, which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for naMCI.

Additionally, the methodology involved in the diagnosis by radiologists can be subjective and difficult to document. In this scenario, the development of accessible approaches capable of supporting the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is crucial. Various approaches have been employed with this objective, specially using brain MRI scans. Although certain satisfactory accuracy results have been achieved, most of the approaches requires very specific pre-processing steps based on the brain anatomy. In this paper, we present a novel image retrieval approach for supporting the Alzheimer's disease diagnostic, based on general use features and unsupervised post-processing step. The brain MRI scans are processed and retrieved through general features without any pre-processing step. In the following, a rankbased unsupervised distance learning procedure is performed for improving the effectiveness of the initial results.

In the proposed method, a dissimilarity matrix is constructed by estimating the coupling strength between every pair of EEG signals, Hierarchical clustering is then applied to group the related electrodes according to the dissimilarity estimated on pairs of EEG recordings. Subsequently, the connectivity density of the electrodes network is calculated. The technique was tested over two different coupling strength descriptors: wavelet coherence (WC) and permutation Jaccard distance (PJD), a novel metric of coupling strength between time series introduced in this paper. Twenty-five MCI patients were enrolled within a follow-up program that consisted of two successive evaluations, at time T0 and at time T1, three months later. At T1, four subjects were diagnosed to have converted to Alzheimer's Disease (AD). When applying the PJD-based method, the converted patients exhibited a significantly increased PJD (p < 0.05), i.e., a reduced overall coupling strength, specifically in delta and θ bands and in the overall range (0.5-32 Hz). In addition, in contrast to stable MCI patients, converted patients exhibited a network density reduction in every subband (delta, θ, alpha, and beta). When WC was used as coupling strength descriptor, the method resulted in a less sensitive and specific outcome. The proposed method, mixing nonlinear analysis to a machine learning approach, appears to provide an objective evaluation of the connectivity density modifications associated to the MCI-AD conversion, just processing noninvasive EEG signals.","2162-237X;2162237X","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2791644","Italian Ministry of Health; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8281011","Alzheimer's Disease (AD);brain connectivity;electroencephalographic (EEG);hierarchical clustering (HC);mild cognitive impairment (MCI);network density;permutation Jaccard distance (PJD);permutation entropy (PE)","Coherence;Complexity theory;Couplings;Dementia;Electroencephalography;Optical wavelength conversion","","","","","","","","","20180205","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Each subject is presented with a two-dimensional object of irregular geometry and is asked to remember it for a short period until he/she is instructed to draw the two-dimensional shape of the object. After the drawing is complete, the reference two-dimensional shape and the one produced by the subject are compared. The paper attempts to model Short term memory using unsupervised Hebbian Learning, considering functional invariance of the other relevant brain modules lying on the encoding and recall pathways of the memory. An error norm is defined to measure the magnitude of the error between the input and reproduced shape pattern, and thereby is used to adapt the short term memory. A small value in error indicates proper learning of the proposed short term memory model, and thus can be used to discriminate people with memory failure. Experiments undertaken reveal that the error metric could be used successfully to detect memory failures in five patients, two of whom were in early stages of Alzheimer's disease, two of whom suffer from amnesia, and one patient with parietal lobe damage. The proposed short term memory model thus is expected to have applications in detecting memory failures in shape-recognition tasks.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2726-6; POD:978-1-5386-2727-3","10.1109/SSCI.2017.8285309","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8285309","Hebbian learning;average gamma power;back propagation neural network;iconic memory;memory failure;shape recognition;short term memory","Brain modeling;Electroencephalography;Encoding;Feature extraction;Shape;Two dimensional displays;Visualization","Hebbian learning;brain models;diseases;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets;neurophysiology;shape recognition","Alzheimer's disease;amnesia;asymmetric two-dimensional object shapes;electroencephalographic signals;encoding;error magnitude;error metric;error norm;memory failure;occipital lobes;parietal lobe damage;prefrontal lobes;recall pathways;reference two-dimensional shape;relevant brain modules;shape-recognition tasks;short term memory model;short term memory modeling;two-dimensional object shapes;unsupervised Hebbian learning;visually explored shape recognition tasks","","","","","","","","Nov. 27 2017-Dec. 1 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent success of deep learning in computer vision have progressed such research further. However, common limitations with such algorithms are reliance on a large number of training images, and requirement of careful optimization of the architecture of deep networks. In this paper, we attempt solving these issues with transfer learning, where state-of-the-art architectures such as VGG and Inception are initialized with pre-trained weights from large benchmark datasets consisting of natural images, and the fully-connected layer is re-trained with only a small number of MRI images. We employ image entropy to select the most informative slices for training. Through experimentation on the OASIS MRI dataset, we show that with training size almost 10 times smaller than the state-of-the-art, we reach comparable or even better performance than current deep-learning based methods.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-3050-7; POD:978-1-5090-3051-4","10.1109/BIBM.2017.8217822","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8217822","Alzheimer's;Deep Learning;Entropy;Transfer Learning","Computer architecture;Entropy;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Training;Training data","biomedical MRI;computer vision;diseases;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing","Alzheimer disease classification;MRI images;OASIS MRI dataset;computer vision;deep learning;deep networks;deep-learning based methods;image entropy;machine learning;natural images;pre-trained weights;transfer learning","","","","","","","","13-16 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first four moments and the entropy of the histograms of these regions are computed. Receiver Operating Characteristics curves are then used to rank the ability of regions to separate PET brain images. Twenty one selected regions are input to both Support Vector Machine and Random Forest classifiers and evaluation is done on 142 brain PET images.

"A Nonparametric Approach for Mild Cognitive Impairment to AD Conversion Prediction: Results on Longitudinal Data","S. Minhas; A. Khanum; F. Riaz; A. Alvi; S. A.

Progression of a slowly progressing disease such as AD benefits from the use of longitudinal data; however, research till now is limited due to the insufficient patient data and short follow-up time. A small dataset size invalidates the estimation of underlying disease progression model; hence, a supervised nonparametric method is proposed. While depicting a real-world setting, longitudinal data of three years are employed for training, whereas only the baseline visit's data is used for validation. The train set is preprocessed for extraction of two dense clusters representing the subjects who remain stable at MCI or progress to AD after three years of the baseline visit. Similarity between these clusters and the test point is calculated in Euclidean space. Multiple features from two modalities of biomarkers, i.e., neuropsychological measures (NM) and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) morphometry are also analyzed. Due to the limited MCI dataset size (NM: 145, MRI: 52, NM+MRI: 29), leave-one-out cross validation setup is employed for performance evaluation. The algorithm performance is noted for both unimodal case and bimodal cases. Superior performance (accuracy: 89.66%, sensitivity: 87.50%, specificity: 92.31%, precision: 93.33%) is delivered by multivariate predictors. Three notable conclusions of this study are: 1) Longitudinal data are more powerful than the temporal data, 2) MRI is a better predictor of MCI-to-AD conversion than NM, and 3) multivariate predictors outperform single predictor models.","2168-2194;21682194","","10.1109/JBHI.2016.2608998","ADNI clinical sites in Canada; AbbVie, Alzheimer's Association; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); Araclon Biotech; BioClinica, Inc.; CereSpir, Inc.; Eisai, Inc.; Elan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; EuroImmun; F.

This research used deep learning framework with modified k-sparse autoencoder (oKSA) classification to locate neutrally degenerated areas of the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), low amyloid beta 1-42 imaging in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of amyloid; each with a sample of 150 images. Results show a correlation between computational demarcation of infected regions and the images. Degeneration in the studied areas was evidenced by high phosphorylated t-/p-tau levels in CSF, regional fluorodeoxyglucose PET, and the presence of atrophy patterns. The use of σKSA algorithm in boosting classification helped to improve the classifier performance.

With this method, the volume differences between the groups can be analyzed in the coordinate dimension. In this study, volumetric differences between Alzheimer and Normal MR images were investigated by voxel based morphometry. From these differences, three dimensional volume loss masks of groups were obtained. The mask of loss was masked with the gray matter area where the basic volume losses of Alzheimer's begin. In each gray matter image, the voxel values corresponding to the same coordinates as the loss mask were transformed into a vector. The voxel values corresponding to the same point as the loss point were ranked by t-test and the most significant coordinate values were ranked. After this ranking, classification was done with support vector machines using voxel values.

The cognitive component is a single hidden layer Radial Basis Function (RBF) network with a q-Gaussian activation function, that allows different RBF's in one network, like the Gaussian, the Inverse Multiquadratic, and the Cauchy functions, by changing a real q-parameter. The meta-cognitive component present in McqRBFN helps in selecting proper samples to learn based on its current knowledge and evolve architecture automatically. The McqRBFN employs a sequential Projection Based Learning (PBL) algorithm to reduce the computational effort used in training.

The focus of most of these studies has relied upon the detection of AD from neu-roimaging data. However, recognizing symptoms early as much as possible(Pre-detection) is crucial as disease modifying drugs will be most effective if administered early in the course of disease, before the occurrence of irreversible brain damages. Therefore, there is a high importance of utilizing automated techniques for the purpose of pre-detection of AD symptoms from such data. We report an experimental approach to evaluate the best pre-detection method of AD. Our study consists of two main experiments. Those two experiments were implemented using the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Prior to our first experiment we have stated an assumption which is, if there is a successful AD detection method that will be successful in AD pre-detection also. Different studies have used different data sets and different diagnosing methods. Therefore we have verified the existing and the most successful detection method which is Support Vector Machine (SVMs) as the first experiment. According to the results obtained from the initial experiment (detection study) the sensitivity is 95.3%, the specificity is 71.4% and the accuracy is 84.4% with use of a SVM. Since those results were not successful, a deep learning based technique (Convolutional Neural Network) was proposed as the second experiment. The proposed Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was being tested using different image segmentation methods and different datasets. Finally the best image segmentation method obtained a high accuracy around 96% (sensitivity - 96%, specificity - 98%). And the CNN model remains unbiased to the dataset. Results of those experiments suggest an important role for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease using image processing and deep - earning techniques.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-6546-2; POD:978-1-5090-6547-9; USB:978-1-5090-6545-5","10.1109/M2VIP.2017.8211486","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8211486","Alzheimers Disease;Convolutional Neural Networks;Image Processing;Magnetic Resonance Imaging;Pattern Recognition;Support Vector Machine","Biological neural networks;Dementia;Feature extraction;Support vector machines","biomedical MRI;brain;correlation methods;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image fusion;image representation;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;support vector machines","AD predetection;ADNI;Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative;CNN;convolutional neural network model;deep learning based technique;detection study;diagnosing methods;different data sets;different datasets;different studies;disease modifying drugs;experimental approach;image processing;image segmentation method;image segmentation methods;initial experiment;irreversible brain damages;main experiments;neu-roimaging data;predetection method;structural MRI data;successful detection method;support vector machine","","","","","","","","21-23 Nov. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The models learn highly complex and subtle differences in spatial atrophy patterns using white matter volumes, gray matter volumes, cortical surface area, cortical thickness, and different types of Fractal Brownian Motion co-occurrence matrices for texture as features to classify AD from cognitive normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in dementia patients.

The in-house evaluations of our two models achieve 56.6% and 58.0% tenfold cross validation accuracies using 504 ADNI subjects. For the public domain evaluation, we are the first to report DNN to CADDementia and our methods yield competitive classification accuracies of 51.4% and 56.8%. Further, both of our proposed models offer higher True Positive Fraction (TPF) for AD class when compared to the top-overall ranked algorithm while Model 1 also ties for top diseased class sensitivity at 58.2% in the CADDementia challenge.

Deep learning is a powerful machine learning algorithm in classification that extracts low-to high-level features. In this paper, we employ a convolutional neural network to distinguish an Alzheimers brain from a normal, healthy brain. The importance of classifying this type of medical data lies in its potential to develop a predictive model or system in order to recognize the symptoms of Alzheimers disease when compared with normal subjects and to estimate the stages of the disease. Classification of clinical data for medical conditions such as Alzheimers disease has always been challenging, and the most problematic aspect has always been selecting the strongest discriminative features. Using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the famous architecture LeNet-5, we successfully classified functional MRI data of Alzheimers subjects from normal controls, where the accuracy of testing data reached 96.85%. This experiment suggests that the shift and scale invariant features extracted by CNN followed by deep learning classification represents the most powerful method of distinguishing clinical data from healthy data in fMRI. This approach also allows for expansion of the methodology to predict more complicated systems.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-4171-8; POD:978-1-5090-4172-5","10.1109/FTC.2016.7821697","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7821697","Alzheimer's Disease;Deep learning;fMRI","Alzheimer's disease;Biological neural networks;Biomedical imaging;Feature extraction;Machine learning;Neurons","biomedical MRI;convolution;diseases;feature extraction;learning (artificial intelligence);medical computing;neural nets;pattern classification","Alzheimer disease;Alzheimers brain;CNN;LeNet-5 architecture;biomedical sciences;clinical data classification;convolutional neural network;deep learning-based pipeline;drug delivery systems;functional MRI data classification;machine learning;medical imaging;pattern recognition;predictive modeling;scale invariant features extraction","","1","","","","","","6-7 Dec. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current techniques for detecting AD rely on cognitive impairment testing which unfortunately does not yield accurate diagnoses until the patient has progressed beyond a moderate AD. In this project, we develop a new approach based on mathematical and image processing techniques for better classification of AD. The most popular current technique analyzes MRI scans using properties of diffeomorphism which generates a mapping from one MRI to another. Since MRIs are very high dimensional vector spaces, the existing technique reduces it to three dimensions and then clusters the images according to presence or lack of AD. However, reducing a high dimensional vector space to three dimensions compromises the information in the data and thus results in some loss of accuracy. We propose to reduce the high dimensional MRI image vector space to 150 dimensions using Principal Component Analysis. In order to categorize the reduced dimensions from PCA for progression of AD, we employ a multiclass neural network. The neural network is trained initially on 230 diagnosed MRIs obtained from OASIS MRI database. We then test our trained neural network on the entire set of 457 MRIs provided by OASIS dataset to confirm the accuracy of diagnosis by our system.

The high-level features are extracted from the stacked autoencoders. The results show that feature fusion enhance the performance of typical autoencoders.

It brings increasingly troubling in today's society. Its early diagnosis and warning are particularly important. Structural magnetic resonance images (MRI) play an important role to help understand the brain anatomical changes related to AD. Traditional methods are usually based on extraction of handcrafted features and training a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a classification method based on combination of multimodel 3D convolutional networks to learn the various features from MR brain images. First, a deep 3D convolutional neural network (3D CNN) is built to hierarchically transform the MR image into more compact high-level features. Second, the multiscale 3D convolutional autoencoders (3D CAEs) are constructed to extract features from MR brain images. The features learned by these models are combined with the upper fully connected layers for image classification in AD diagnosis. The proposed method can automatically learn the generic features from the imaging data for classification without segmentations of brain tissues and regions. Our method is evaluated using T1-weighted MR brain images on 428 subjects including 199 AD patients and 229 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 88.31% for AD classification and an AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 92.73%, demonstrating the promising classification performances.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1620-8; POD:978-1-5386-1621-5","10.1109/IST.2017.8261566","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8261566","Alzheimer's disease;convolutional autoencoder;convolutional neural network;feature fusion","Brain modeling;Diseases;Feature extraction;Image classification;Kernel;Three-dimensional displays","biomedical MRI;brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical disorders;medical image processing;neural nets;neurophysiology","3D CAEs;3D CNN;AD classification;Alzheimer's disease classification;Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;MR brain images;MR image;brain anatomical changes;brain tissues;classification method;cognitive functions;deep 3D convolutional neural network;deep learning;early diagnosis;generic features;handcrafted features;high-level features;image classification;imaging data;irreversible neurodegenerative disorder;multimodel 3D convolutional networks;multimodel convolutional networks;multiscale 3D convolutional autoencoders;structural magnetic resonance images;warning","","","","","","","","18-20 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A clinician can take profit from retrieving subjects' scans with similar patterns. The CBVIR approach has been used since recently for Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. The most explored imaging modality in this context is the structural MRI. The Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) is a relatively recent technique and CBVIR approaches have not yet been developed on it. The combination of several MRI modalities improves the performances of CBVIR methods, but first of all it is necessary to explore the ability of DTI modality to give a correct answer alone. The present work is amongst the earliest attempts to use visual features as in a generic CBVIR, on this modality for AD research. The proposed approach is based on the comparison of visual features extracted from the hippocampal area.

Deep polynomial network (DPN) is a novel deep learning algorithm, which can effectively learn feature representation from small samples. In this work, a stacked DPN (S-DPN) algorithm is proposed to further improve feature representation. We then propose a multi-modality S-DPN (MM-S-DPN) algorithm to fuse multi-modality neuroimaging data and learn more discriminative and robust feature representation for AD classification. Experiments are performed on ADNI dataset with MRI and PET images as multi-modality data. The results indicate that S-DPN is superior to DPN and stacked auto-encoder algorithms.

Accurate and early diagnosis of AD is vital for the patient care and development of future treatment. Positrons Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional molecular imaging modality, which proves to be a powerful tool to help understand the brain changes related to AD. Most existing methods extract the handcraft features from images, and then train a classifier to distinguish AD from other groups. The success of these computer-aided diagnosis methods highly depends on the image preprocessing, including rigid registration and segmentation. Motivated by the success of deep learning in image classification, this paper proposes a new classification framework based on combination of 2D convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN), which learns the features of 3D PET images by decomposing the 3D image into a sequence of 2D slices. In this framework, the hierarchical 2D CNNs are built to capture the intra-slice features while the gated recurrent unit (GRU) of RNN is used to extract the inter-slice features for final classification. No rigid image registration and segmentation are required for PET images. Our method is evaluated on the baseline PET images from 339 subjects including 93 AD patients, 146 mild cognitive impairments (MCI) and 100 normal controls (NC) from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves an AUC of 95.28% for classification of AD vs. NC and 83.90% for classification of MCI vs. NC, respectively, demonstrating the promising classification performance.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-1620-8; POD:978-1-5386-1621-5","10.1109/IST.2017.8261461","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8261461","Alzheimer's disease;Convolutional neural network;Deep learning;Image classification;Positron emission tomography;Recurrent neural network","Feature extraction;Image classification;Image segmentation;Logic gates;Positron emission tomography;Three-dimensional displays;Two dimensional displays","brain;cognition;diseases;feature extraction;image classification;image registration;image segmentation;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography;recurrent neural nets","2D convolutional neural networks;Alzheimer's disease diagnosis;Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;baseline PET images;brain changes;classification framework;early diagnosis;functional molecular imaging modality;gated recurrent unit;handcraft features;image classification;image preprocessing;interslice features;intraslice features;irreversible brain degenerative disorder;patient care;positrons emission tomography;progressive brain degenerative disorder;recurrent neural networks;rigid image registration;segmentation;time 65.0 year","","","","","","","","18-20 Oct. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The machine learning algorithms used are: the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for classification, with its performance optimized by a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and a Genetic algorithm (GA) used for feature selection. A Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) approach is used for feature extraction from the MRI images and GA is used to reduce the high dimensional features needed for classification. The GA-ELM-PSO classifier yields an average training accuracy of 94.57 % and a testing accuracy of 87.23 %, averaged across the three classes, over ten random trials.

In the ALBP, sign and magnitude value were introduced as an enhancement to the previous LBP method. Due to a great number of features are produced by ALBP, the principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis are used as feature selection method. Furthermore, SVM classifier is applied for multiclass classification including Alzheimer's, mild cognitive impairment, and normal condition of whole brain and hippocampus.

Firstly, we convert raw functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to a matrix to represent activity of 90 brain regions. Secondly, to represent the functional connectivity between different brain regions, a correlation matrix is obtained by calculating the correlation between each pair of brain regions. In the next, a targeted autoencoder network is built to classify the correlation matrix, which is sensitive to AD. Finally, the experiment results show that our proposed method for AD prediction achieves much better effects than traditional means. It finds the correlations between different brain regions efficiently, provides strong reference for AD prediction. Compared to Support Vector Machine (SVM), about 25% improvement is gained in prediction accuracy. The e-health field becomes more complete and effective owing to that.

Ranking selected regions according to their SPF and inputting them to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, yields better classification accuracy rate than when inputting the same number of ranked regions extracted from four others classical feature selection methods.","","Electronic:978-0-9928-6263-3; POD:978-1-4799-8851-8","10.1109/EUSIPCO.2015.7362463","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7362463","Alzheimer's Disease (AD);Classification;Computer-Aided diagnosis (CAD);Feature Selection;Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC);Support Vector Machine (SVM);Voxel-Based Analysis (VBA)","Brain;Databases;Diseases;Europe;Positron emission tomography;Support vector machines;Vegetation","brain;diseases;feature selection;image classification;medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography;statistical analysis;support vector machines","Alzheimer disease;brain PET image classification;brain PET image segmentation;computer-aided diagnosis technique;feature selection methods;neurodegenerative disease diagnosis;positron emission tomography;separation power factor;statistical parameters;support vector machine classifier","","","","28","","","","Aug. 31 2015-Sept. 4 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Computer-Aided Diagnosis (CAD), based on medical image analysis could help quantitative evaluation of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's Disease (AD). A novel method of ranking the effectiveness of brain Volume Of Interest (VOI) to separate healthy control (HC) from AD brains PET images is presented in this paper. Brain images are first mapped into anatomical VOIs using an atlas. Histogram-based features are then extracted and used to select and rank VOIs according to the Area Under Curve (AUC) parameter, which produces a hierarchy of the ability of VOIs to separate between groups of subjects. The top-ranked VOIs are then input into a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The developed method is evaluated on a local data base image and compared to known selection feature methods. Results show that using AUC outperforms classification results in the case of a two group separation.","","","10.1109/JTEHM.2018.2796600","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8318637","Alzheimer’s Disease;Classification;Computer-Aided diagnosis;Feature selection;First Order Statistics;Machine learning;Positron Emission Tomography","Brain;Dementia;Feature extraction;Positron emission tomography;Support vector machines","","","","","","","","","20180316","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

Despite its good performance especially in case of using heterogeneous data, such learning schema and its variants usually utilize a L-l norm constraint that promotes sparse solutions, which may cause loss of potentially important information. In this paper, we propose the non-sparse infinite-kernel learning machine (NS-IKLM) for automated identification of Alzheimer cases from normal controls. In our approach, a modified constraint is utilized to promotes non-sparse solutions and kernel parameters are automatically tuned during the learning process. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on a set of FDG-PET images selected from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaing initiative (ADNI) cohort. Our results demonstrate that the proposed non-sparse NS-IKLM is able to achieve satisfying dementia identification at a relatively low computational cost.","","Electronic:978-1-4799-5199-4; POD:978-1-4799-5200-7; USB:978-1-4799-5198-7","10.1109/ICARCV.2014.7064416","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7064416","ADNI;FDG-PET;Infinite kernel learning;dementia","Dementia;Feature extraction;Kernel;Positron emission tomography","brain;computer aided analysis;feature extraction;information retrieval systems;medical disorders;medical image processing;neurophysiology;positron emission tomography;storage automation","ADNI cohort;ADNI-selected PET images;ADNI-selected positron emission tomography images;Alzheimer case identification;Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative;FDG-PET images;L-l norm constraint;MKLM schema evaluation;MKLM variants;PET imaging;automated disease identification;automatic kernel parameter tuning;computer-aided dementia identification;computer-aided dementia pathology progress tracking;heterogeneous data;information loss;learning machine evaluation;learning schema;low computational cost dementia identification;multikernel learning machine;nonsparse NS-IKLM-achieved dementia identification;nonsparse infinite-kernel learning machine;nonsparse solution;positron emission tomography imaging;sparse solutions","","1","","24","","","","10-12 Dec. 2014","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Previous studies using electroencephalography (EEG) have focused on the slowing of oscillatory brain rhythms, coupled with complexity reduction of the corresponding time-series and their enhanced compressibility. These analyses have been typically carried out on single channels. However, limited investigations have focused on the possibility yielded by computational intelligence methodologies and novel machine learning approaches applied to multichannel schemes. The study at screening level on EEG recordings of subjects at risk could be useful to highlight the emergence of underlying AD progression (or at least support any further clinical investigation). In this work, the representational power of Deep Learning on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is exploited to generate suitable sets of features that are then able to classify EEG patterns of AD from a prodromal version of dementia (Mild Cognitive Impairment, MCI) and from age-matched Healthy Controls (HC). The processing system here used enforces a series of convolutional-subsampling layers in order to derive a multivariate assembly of latent, novel patterns, finally used to categorize sets of EEG from different classes of subjects. The final processor here proposed is able to reach an averaged 80% of correct classification with good performance on both sensitivity and specificity by using a Multilayered Feedforward Perceptron (MLP) of the standard type as a final block of the procedure.","","Electronic:978-1-5090-1131-5; POD:978-1-5090-1132-2","10.1109/RTSI.2016.7740576","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7740576","Alzheimer's disease;Convolutional Neural Networks;Deep Learning;Mild Cognitive Impairment;Scalp EEG","Databases;Diseases;Electroencephalography;Feature extraction;Scalp;Standards;Time-frequency analysis","diseases;electroencephalography;learning (artificial intelligence);medical signal processing;neural nets","AD progression;Alzheimer's disease patients;EEG classification;computational intelligence methodologies;convolutional-subsampling layers;deep convolutional neural networks;electroencephalography;healthy controls;machine learning approaches;mild cognitive impairment;multilayered feedforward perceptron;oscillatory brain rhythms;pathophysiological mechanism;scalp EEG recordings","","","","","","","","7-9 Sept. 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead of the low-level visual appearance, we design a CCA-PairLDA feature representation method to capture the similarity between images with high-level semantics. First, we extract the PairLDA topics to represent an image as a mixture of latent semantic topics in an image pair context. Second, we generate a CCA-correlation model to represent the semantic association between an image pair for similarity computation. While PairLDA adjusts the latent topics for all image pairs, CCA-correlation helps to associate an individual image pair. In this way, the semantic descriptions of an image pair are closely correlated, and naturally correspond to similarity computation between images. We evaluated our method on two public medical imaging datasets for image retrieval and showed improved performance.","0018-9294;00189294","","10.1109/TBME.2015.2478028","AADRF; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; VIA and ELCAP groups; 10.13039/100000002 - NIH NA-MIC; 10.13039/100000002 - National Institutes of Health; 10.13039/100000005 - Department of Defense; 10.13039/100000049 - National Institute on Aging; 10.13039/100000070 - National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering; 10.13039/100000163 - ARC; 10.13039/100007333 - ADNI; 10.13039/100007333 - Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI); 10.13039/501100001334 - NAC; 10.13039/501100001809 - National Natural Science Foundation of China; 10.13039/501100004480 - Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province, China; ","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7254153","Latent topic;Medical image retrieval;latent topic;medical image retrieval;semantic association","Biomedical imaging;Context;Feature extraction;Semantics;Silicon;Training;Visualization","computerised tomography;feature extraction;image retrieval;medical image processing","CCA-PairLDA feature representation method;CCA-correlation model;anatomical structures;computerised tomography;diagnostics;feature extraction method;high-level semantics;image pair context;latent semantic topics;medical image retrieval;pairwise latent semantic association;public medical imaging datasets;semantic association;similarity computation;therapy;visual variations","Algorithms;Brain Neoplasms;Databases, Factual;Humans;Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted;Lung Neoplasms;Semantics","5","","60","","","20150910","May 2016","","IEEE","IEEE Journals & Magazines"

Although our understanding of the key steps underlying neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is incomplete, it is clear that it begins long before symptoms are noticed by patient. Conventional clinical decision making systems are more manual in nature and ultimate conclusion in terms of exact diagnosis is remote. The solution for this is the employment of advanced Biomedical Engineering Technology for making diagnosis. Any disease modifying treatments which are developed are most possibly to be achieving success if initiated early in the process, and this needs that we tend to develop reliable, validated and economical ways to diagnose Alzheimer's kind pathology. However, despite comprehensive searches, no single test has shown adequate sensitivity and specificity, and it is likely that a combination will be needed. The parameters of the human body related to AD can be profiled using computers that can be utilized for the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. There are several imaging techniques used in clinical practice for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's type pathology. Prominent of them are Magnetic Resonance Imaging Scan (MRI), Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography Scanning (SPECT) and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT). The previous and recent studies made on Alzheimer's disease clearly investigated that there are some parameter changes on the retina of the eye of AD patients. In this research we have classify the OCT retinal images using neural networks for the early diagnosis of AD.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-0374-1; POD:978-1-5386-0375-8","10.1109/I2C2.2017.8321780","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8321780","Alzheimer Disease;Diagnosis;Neural Networks;OCT Image;Wavelet Networks","Computational modeling;Dementia;Feature extraction;Image segmentation;Neurons;Retina","","","","","","","","","","23-24 June 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Therefore, in this study we propose an automated feedback extraction method to exclude the involvement of radiologists. Instead of incorporating the feedbacks from them, the similarity relationship between the initial retrieval results and all candidate images is used to indicate the preferences of these retrieved items regarding to the query, i.e., relevance or irrelevance, and to further re-rank the candidates.

The deep polynomial networks (DPN) is a recently proposed deep learning algorithm, which performs well on both large-scale and small-size datasets. In this study, a multimodal stacked DPN (MM-SDPN) algorithm, which MM-SDPN consists of two-stage SDPNs, is proposed to fuse and learn feature representation from multimodal neuroimaging data for AD diagnosis. Specifically speaking, two SDPNs are first used to learn high-level features of MRI and PET, respectively, which are then fed to another SDPN to fuse multimodal neuroimaging information.

The performance of human diagnosis degrades due to fatigue, cognitive biases, systems faults, and distractions. However, artificial intelligence based diagnosis systems are less error prone and give safe support to clinicians in detection and decision making. This work presents a smart and reliable way of diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its possible early stage i.e., mild cognitive impairment. Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disease and leads to severe memory loss and inability to cope with daily life tasks. The diagnosis of AD from structural images requires great skill and is challenging for human diagnostics. The presented framework is based on deep learning and detects Alzheimer's and its initial stages accurately from structural MRI scans. The framework analyzes four different classes simultaneously in a single setup. The testing accuracy of diagnosis obtained by the method is 98.88%. Experiments are also performed on binary data and transfer learning is applied for multiclass classification achieving 99.7% accuracy. Once a good trained model is obtained, the decision for an unseen test scan is given within a few seconds. These models are free from the factors that are responsible for causing human diagnostic errors. Therefore, these models are dependable and can provide much faster diagnosis.","","Electronic:978-1-5386-2524-8; POD:978-1-5386-2525-5; USB:978-1-5386-2523-1","10.1109/ISC2.2017.8090871","","http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8090871","Alzheimer's disease;MRI;artificial intelligence;pattern recognition;smart diagnosis;smart healthcare","","biomedical MRI;cognition;diseases;image classification;learning (artificial intelligence);medical image processing;neurophysiology;patient diagnosis","Alzheimers disease diagnosis;artificial intelligence systems;binary data;deep learning;health care;mild cognitive impairment;multiclass classification;neurodegenerative disease;pattern recognition;smart diagnosis;structural MRI scans;transfer learning","","","","","","","","14-17 Sept. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
