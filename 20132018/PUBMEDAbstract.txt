Here we test the hypothesis that the neurodegenerative process in Parkinson's
disease (PD) moves stereotypically along neural networks, possibly reflecting the
spread of toxic alpha-synuclein molecules. PD patients (n = 105) and matched
controls (n = 57) underwent T1-MRI at entry and 1 year later as part of the
Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative. Over this period, PD patients
demonstrate significantly greater cortical thinning than controls in parts of the
left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. 
Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally or
structurally) to a "disease reservoir" evaluated by MRI at baseline. The atrophy 
pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one described in certain cases of 
Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex 
in PD follows neuronal connectivity and that disease spread to the cortex may
herald the onset of cognitive impairment.

Network-sensitive neuroimaging methods have been used to characterize large-scale
brain network degeneration in Alzheimer's disease and its prodrome. However, few 
studies have investigated the combined effect of Alzheimer's disease and
cerebrovascular disease on brain network degeneration. Our study sought to
examine the intrinsic functional connectivity and structural covariance network
changes in 235 prodromal and clinical Alzheimer's disease patients with and
without cerebrovascular disease. We focused particularly on two higher-order
cognitive networks-the default mode network and the executive control network. We
found divergent functional connectivity and structural covariance patterns in
Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease.
Alzheimer's disease patients without cerebrovascular disease, but not Alzheimer's
disease patients with cerebrovascular disease, showed reductions in posterior
default mode network functional connectivity. By comparison, while both groups
exhibited parietal reductions in executive control network functional
connectivity, only Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease
showed increases in frontal executive control network connectivity. Importantly, 
these distinct executive control network changes were recapitulated in prodromal 
Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease. Across
Alzheimer's disease patients with and without cerebrovascular disease, higher
default mode network functional connectivity z-scores correlated with greater
hippocampal volumes while higher executive control network functional
connectivity z-scores correlated with greater white matter changes. In parallel, 
only Alzheimer's disease patients without cerebrovascular disease showed
increased default mode network structural covariance, while only Alzheimer's
disease patients with cerebrovascular disease showed increased executive control 
network structural covariance compared to controls. Our findings demonstrate the 
differential neural network structural and functional changes in Alzheimer's
disease with and without cerebrovascular disease, suggesting that the underlying 
pathology of Alzheimer's disease patients with cerebrovascular disease might
differ from those without cerebrovascular disease and reflect a combination of
more severe cerebrovascular disease and less severe Alzheimer's disease network
degeneration phenotype.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether logopenic features of phonologic loop dysfunction
reflect Alzheimer disease (AD) neuropathology in primary progressive aphasia
(PPA).
METHODS: We performed a retrospective case-control study of 34 patients with PPA 
with available autopsy tissue. We compared baseline and longitudinal clinical
features in patients with primary AD neuropathology to those with primary non-AD 
pathologies. We analyzed regional neuroanatomic disease burden in
pathology-defined groups using postmortem neuropathologic data.
RESULTS: A total of 19/34 patients had primary AD pathology and 15/34 had non-AD 
pathology (13 frontotemporal lobar degeneration, 2 Lewy body disease). A total of
16/19 (84%) patients with AD had a logopenic spectrum phenotype; 5 met published 
criteria for the logopenic variant (lvPPA), 8 had additional grammatical or
semantic deficits (lvPPA+), and 3 had relatively preserved sentence repetition
(lvPPA-). Sentence repetition was impaired in 68% of patients with PPA with AD
pathology; forward digit span (DF) was impaired in 90%, substantially higher than
in non-AD PPA (33%, p < 0.01). Lexical retrieval difficulty was common in all
patients with PPA and did not discriminate between groups. Compared to non-AD,
PPA with AD pathology had elevated microscopic neurodegenerative pathology in the
superior/midtemporal gyrus, angular gyrus, and midfrontal cortex (p < 0.01). Low 
DF scores correlated with high microscopic pathologic burden in
superior/midtemporal and angular gyri (p ≤ 0.03).
CONCLUSIONS: Phonologic loop dysfunction is a central feature of AD-associated
PPA and specifically correlates with temporoparietal neurodegeneration.
Quantitative measures of phonologic loop function, combined with modified
clinical lvPPA criteria, may help discriminate AD-associated PPA.

Episodic memory impairment is a consistent, pronounced deficit in pre-clinical
stages of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). Individuals with risk factors for 
AD exhibit altered brain function several decades prior to the onset of
AD-related symptoms. In the current event-related fMRI study of spatial context
memory we tested the hypothesis that middle-aged adults (MA; 40-58 yrs) with a
family history of late onset AD (MA+ FH), or a combined + FH and apolipoprotein E
ε4 allele risk factors for AD (MA+ FH + APOE4), will exhibit differences in
encoding and retrieval-related brain activity, compared to - FH - APOE4 MA
controls. We also hypothesized that the two at-risk MA groups will exhibit
distinct patterns of correlation between brain activity and memory performance,
compared to controls. To test these hypotheses we conducted multivariate task,
and behavior, partial least squares analysis of fMRI data obtained during
successful context encoding and retrieval. Our results indicate that even though 
there were no significant group differences in context memory performance, there 
were significant differences in brain activity and brain-behavior correlations
involving the hippocampus, inferior parietal cortex, cingulate, and precuneus
cortex in MA with AD risk factors, compared to controls. In addition, we observed
that brain activity and brain-behavior correlations in anterior-medial PFC and in
ventral visual cortex differentiated the two MA risk groups from each other, and 
from MAcontrols. Our results indicate that functional differences in episodic
memory-related regions are present by early midlife in adults with + FH and
+ APOE-4 risk factors for late onset AD, compared to middle-aged controls.

Intentional facial expression of emotion is critical to healthy social
interactions. Patients with neurodegenerative disease, particularly those with
right temporal or prefrontal atrophy, show dramatic socioemotional impairment.
This was an exploratory study examining the neural and behavioral correlates of
intentional facial expression of emotion in neurodegenerative disease patients
and healthy controls. One hundred and thirty three participants (45 Alzheimer's
disease, 16 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia, 8 non-fluent primary
progressive aphasia, 10 progressive supranuclear palsy, 11 right-temporal
frontotemporal dementia, 9 semantic variant primary progressive aphasia patients 
and 34 healthy controls) were video recorded while imitating static images of
emotional faces and producing emotional expressions based on verbal command; the 
accuracy of their expression was rated by blinded raters. Participants also
underwent face-to-face socioemotional testing and informants described
participants' typical socioemotional behavior. Patients' performance on emotion
expression tasks was correlated with gray matter volume using voxel-based
morphometry (VBM) across the entire sample. We found that intentional emotional
imitation scores were related to fundamental socioemotional deficits; patients
with known socioemotional deficits performed worse than controls on intentional
emotion imitation; and intentional emotional expression predicted caregiver
ratings of empathy and interpersonal warmth. Whole brain VBMs revealed a
rightward cortical atrophy pattern homologous to the left lateralized speech
production network was associated with intentional emotional imitation deficits. 
Results point to a possible neural mechanisms underlying complex socioemotional
communication deficits in neurodegenerative disease patients.

INTRODUCTION: The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) has
continued development and standardization of methodologies for biomarkers and has
provided an increased depth and breadth of data available to qualified
researchers. This review summarizes the over 400 publications using ADNI data
during 2014 and 2015.
METHODS: We used standard searches to find publications using ADNI data.
RESULTS: (1) Structural and functional changes, including subtle changes to
hippocampal shape and texture, atrophy in areas outside of hippocampus, and
disruption to functional networks, are detectable in presymptomatic subjects
before hippocampal atrophy; (2) In subjects with abnormal β-amyloid deposition
(Aβ+), biomarkers become abnormal in the order predicted by the amyloid cascade
hypothesis; (3) Cognitive decline is more closely linked to tau than Aβ
deposition; (4) Cerebrovascular risk factors may interact with Aβ to increase
white-matter (WM) abnormalities which may accelerate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
progression in conjunction with tau abnormalities; (5) Different patterns of
atrophy are associated with impairment of memory and executive function and may
underlie psychiatric symptoms; (6) Structural, functional, and metabolic network 
connectivities are disrupted as AD progresses. Models of prion-like spreading of 
Aβ pathology along WM tracts predict known patterns of cortical Aβ deposition and
declines in glucose metabolism; (7) New AD risk and protective gene loci have
been identified using biologically informed approaches; (8) Cognitively normal
and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects are heterogeneous and include groups
typified not only by "classic" AD pathology but also by normal biomarkers,
accelerated decline, and suspected non-Alzheimer's pathology; (9) Selection of
subjects at risk of imminent decline on the basis of one or more pathologies
improves the power of clinical trials; (10) Sensitivity of cognitive outcome
measures to early changes in cognition has been improved and surrogate outcome
measures using longitudinal structural magnetic resonance imaging may further
reduce clinical trial cost and duration; (11) Advances in machine learning
techniques such as neural networks have improved diagnostic and prognostic
accuracy especially in challenges involving MCI subjects; and (12) Network
connectivity measures and genetic variants show promise in multimodal
classification and some classifiers using single modalities are rivaling
multimodal classifiers.
DISCUSSION: Taken together, these studies fundamentally deepen our understanding 
of AD progression and its underlying genetic basis, which in turn informs and
improves clinical trial design.

BACKGROUND: Multi-Scale Ranked Organizing Map coupled with Implicit Function as
Squashing Time algorithm(MS-ROM/I-FAST) is a new, complex system based on
Artificial Neural networks (ANNs) able to extract features of interest in
computerized EEG through the analysis of few minutes of their EEG without any
preliminary pre-processing. A proof of concept study previously published showed 
accuracy values ranging from 94%-98% in discerning subjects with Mild Cognitive
Impairment and/or Alzheimer's Disease from healthy elderly people. The presence
of deviant patterns in simple resting state EEG recordings in autism, consistent 
with the atypical organization of the cerebral cortex present, prompted us in
applying this potent analytical systems in search of a EEG signature of the
disease.
AIM OF THE STUDY: The aim of the study is to assess how effectively this
methodology distinguishes subjects with autism from typically developing ones.
METHODS: Fifteen definite ASD subjects (13 males; 2 females; age range 7-14; mean
value = 10.4) and ten typically developing subjects (4 males; 6 females; age
range 7-12; mean value 9.2) were included in the study. Patients received Autism 
diagnoses according to DSM-V criteria, subsequently confirmed by the ADOS scale. 
A segment of artefact-free EEG lasting 60 seconds was used to compute input
values for subsequent analyses. MS-ROM/I-FAST coupled with a well-documented
evolutionary system able to select predictive features (TWIST) created an
invariant features vector input of EEG on which supervised machine learning
systems acted as blind classifiers.
RESULTS: The overall predictive capability of machine learning system in sorting 
out autistic cases from normal control amounted consistently to 100% with all
kind of systems employed using training-testing protocol and to 84% - 92.8% using
Leave One Out protocol. The similarities among the ANN weight matrixes measured
with apposite algorithms were not affected by the age of the subjects. This
suggests that the ANNs do not read age-related EEG patterns, but rather invariant
features related to the brain's underlying disconnection signature.
CONCLUSION: This pilot study seems to open up new avenues for the development of 
non-invasive diagnostic testing for the early detection of ASD.

Classifying neurodegenerative brain diseases in MRI aims at correctly assigning
discrete labels to MRI scans. Such labels usually refer to a diagnostic decision 
a learner infers based on what it has learned from a training sample of MRI
scans. Classification from MRI voxels separately typically does not provide
independent evidence towards or against a class; the information relevant for
classification is only present in the form of complicated multivariate patterns
(or "features"). Deep learning solves this problem by learning a sequence of
non-linear transformations that result in feature representations that are better
suited to classification. Such learned features have been shown to drastically
outperform hand-engineered features in computer vision and audio analysis
domains. However, applying the deep learning approach to the task of MRI
classification is extremely challenging, because it requires a very large amount 
of data which is currently not available. We propose to instead use a three
dimensional scattering transform, which resembles a deep convolutional neural
network but has no learnable parameters. Furthermore, the scattering transform
linearizes diffeomorphisms (due to e.g. residual anatomical variability in MRI
scans), making the different disease states more easily separable using a linear 
classifier. In experiments on brain morphometry in Alzheimer's disease, and on
white matter microstructural damage in HIV, scattering representations are shown 
to be highly effective for the task of disease classification. For instance, in
semi-supervised learning of progressive versus stable MCI, we reach an accuracy
of 82.7%. We also present a visualization method to highlight areas that provide 
evidence for or against a certain class, both on an individual and group level.

We developed a novel computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system that uses
feature-ranking and a genetic algorithm to analyze structural magnetic resonance 
imaging data; using this system, we can predict conversion of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI)-to-Alzheimer's disease (AD) at between one and three years
before clinical diagnosis. The CAD system was developed in four stages. First, we
used a voxel-based morphometry technique to investigate global and local gray
matter (GM) atrophy in an AD group compared with healthy controls (HCs). Regions 
with significant GM volume reduction were segmented as volumes of interest
(VOIs). Second, these VOIs were used to extract voxel values from the respective 
atrophy regions in AD, HC, stable MCI (sMCI) and progressive MCI (pMCI) patient
groups. The voxel values were then extracted into a feature vector. Third, at the
feature-selection stage, all features were ranked according to their respective
t-test scores and a genetic algorithm designed to find the optimal feature
subset. The Fisher criterion was used as part of the objective function in the
genetic algorithm. Finally, the classification was carried out using a support
vector machine (SVM) with 10-fold cross validation. We evaluated the proposed
automatic CAD system by applying it to baseline values from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset (160 AD, 162 HC, 65 sMCI and 71
pMCI subjects). The experimental results indicated that the proposed system is
capable of distinguishing between sMCI and pMCI patients, and would be
appropriate for practical use in a clinical setting.

Voxel-Based Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease Using Classifier Ensembles.

Armananzas R, Iglesias M, Morales DA, Alonso-Nanclares L.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is one of the most promising
noninvasive techniques for early Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. In this
paper, we explore the application of different machine learning techniques to the
classification of fMRI data for this purpose. The functional images were first
preprocessed using the statistical parametric mapping toolbox to output
individual maps of statistically activated voxels. A fast filter was applied
afterwards to select voxels commonly activated across demented and nondemented
groups. Four feature ranking selection techniques were embedded into a wrapper
scheme using an inner-outer loop for the selection of relevant voxels. The
wrapper approach was guided by the performance of six pattern recognition models,
three of which were ensemble classifiers based on stochastic searches. Final
classification performance was assessed from the nested internal and external
cross-validation loops taking several voxel sets ordered by importance. Numerical
performance was evaluated using statistical tests, and the best combination of
voxel selection and classification reached a 97.14% average accuracy. Results
repeatedly pointed out Brodmann regions with distinct activation patterns between
demented and nondemented profiles, indicating that the machine learning analysis 
described is a powerful method to detect differences in several brain regions
between both groups.

BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This paper presents an automatic computer-aided
diagnosis (CAD) system based on feature ranking for detection of Alzheimer's
disease (AD) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) data.
METHODS: The proposed CAD system is composed of four systematic stages. First,
global and local differences in the gray matter (GM) of AD patients compared to
the GM of healthy controls (HCs) are analyzed using a voxel-based morphometry
technique. The aim is to identify significant local differences in the volume of 
GM as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel intensity values of the VOIs
are extracted as raw features. Third, the raw features are ranked using a
seven-feature ranking method, namely, statistical dependency (SD), mutual
information (MI), information gain (IG), Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC),
t-test score (TS), Fisher's criterion (FC), and the Gini index (GI). The features
with higher scores are more discriminative. To determine the number of top
features, the estimated classification error based on training set made up of the
AD and HC groups is calculated, with the vector size that minimized this error
selected as the top discriminative feature. Fourth, the classification is
performed using a support vector machine (SVM). In addition, a data fusion
approach among feature ranking methods is introduced to improve the
classification performance.
RESULTS: The proposed method is evaluated using a data-set from ADNI (130 AD and 
130 HC) with 10-fold cross-validation. The classification accuracy of the
proposed automatic system for the diagnosis of AD is up to 92.48% using the sMRI 
data.
CONCLUSIONS: An automatic CAD system for the classification of AD based on
feature-ranking method and classification errors is proposed. In this regard,
seven-feature ranking methods (i.e., SD, MI, IG, PCC, TS, FC, and GI) are
evaluated. The optimal size of top discriminative features is determined by the
classification error estimation in the training phase. The experimental results
indicate that the performance of the proposed system is comparative to that of
state-of-the-art classification models.

BACKGROUND: Noninvasive and effective biomarkers for early detection of amnestic 
mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) before measurable changes in behavioral
performance remain scarce. Cognitive event-related potentials (ERPs) measure
synchronized synaptic neural activity associated with a cognitive event. Loss of 
synapses is a hallmark of the neuropathology of early Alzheimer's disease (AD).
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that ERP responses during working 
memory retrieval discriminate aMCI from cognitively normal controls (NC) matched 
in age and education.
METHODS: Eighteen NC, 17 subjects with aMCI, and 13 subjects with AD performed a 
delayed match-to-sample task specially designed not only to be easy enough for
impaired participants to complete but also to generate comparable performance
between subjects with NC and those with aMCI. Scalp electroencephalography,
memory accuracy, and reaction times were measured.
RESULTS: Whereas memory performance separated the AD group from the others, the
performance of NC and subjects with aMCI was similar. In contrast, left frontal
cognitive ERP patterns differentiated subjects with aMCI from NC. Enhanced P3
responses at left frontal sites were associated with nonmatching relative to
matching stimuli during working memory tasks in patients with aMCI and AD, but
not in NC. The accuracy of discriminating aMCI from NC was 85% by using left
frontal match/nonmatch effect combined with nonmatch reaction time.
CONCLUSIONS: The left frontal cognitive ERP indicator holds promise as a
sensitive, simple, affordable, and noninvasive biomarker for detection of early
cognitive impairment.

PURPOSE: Segmentation of brain magnetic resonance (MR) images into white matter
(WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is crucial for brain
structural measurement and disease diagnosis. Learning-based segmentation methods
depend largely on the availability of good training ground truth. However, the
commonly used 3T MR images are of insufficient image quality and often exhibit
poor intensity contrast between WM, GM, and CSF. Therefore, they are not ideal
for providing good ground truth label data for training learning-based methods.
Recent advances in ultrahigh field 7T imaging make it possible to acquire images 
with excellent intensity contrast and signal-to-noise ratio.
METHODS: In this paper, the authors propose an algorithm based on random forest
for segmenting 3T MR images by training a series of classifiers based on reliable
labels obtained semiautomatically from 7T MR images. The proposed algorithm
iteratively refines the probability maps of WM, GM, and CSF via a cascade of
random forest classifiers for improved tissue segmentation.
RESULTS: The proposed method was validated on two datasets, i.e., 10 subjects
collected at their institution and 797 3T MR images from the Alzheimer's Disease 
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset. Specifically, for the mean Dice ratio of 
all 10 subjects, the proposed method achieved 94.52% ± 0.9%, 89.49% ± 1.83%, and 
79.97% ± 4.32% for WM, GM, and CSF, respectively, which are significantly better 
than the state-of-the-art methods (p-values < 0.021). For the ADNI dataset, the
group difference comparisons indicate that the proposed algorithm outperforms
state-of-the-art segmentation methods.
CONCLUSIONS: The authors have developed and validated a novel fully automated
method for 3T brain MR image segmentation.

AIM: Alzheimer's disease patients are increasing rapidly every year. Scholars
tend to use computer vision methods to develop automatic diagnosis system.
(Background) In 2015, Gorji et al. proposed a novel method using pseudo Zernike
moment. They tested four classifiers: learning vector quantization neural
network, pattern recognition neural network trained by Levenberg-Marquardt, by
resilient backpropagation, and by scaled conjugate gradient.
METHOD: This study presents an improved method by introducing a relatively new
classifier-linear regression classification. Our method selects one axial slice
from 3D brain image, and employed pseudo Zernike moment with maximum order of 15 
to extract 256 features from each image. Finally, linear regression
classification was harnessed as the classifier.
RESULTS: The proposed approach obtains an accuracy of 97.51%, a sensitivity of
96.71%, and a specificity of 97.73%.
CONCLUSION: Our method performs better than Gorji's approach and five other
state-of-the-art approaches. Therefore, it can be used to detect Alzheimer's
disease.

The majority of logopenic variant primary progressive aphasia (lv-PPA) cases
harbour Alzheimer pathology, suggesting that lv-PPA constitutes an atypical
presentation of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, even if caused by Alzheimer
pathology, the clinical manifestations of lv-PPA differ from those observed in
the typical or amnestic AD presentation: in lv-PPA, aphasia is the main feature
while amnestic AD is characterised by impaired episodic memory. Anomia or
impaired naming, however, is present in both AD presentations. Whether these
presentations share anatomical and mechanistic processes of anomia has not been
fully investigated. Accordingly, we studied naming performance and its
relationship with regions of brain atrophy in 23 amnestic AD and 22 lv-PPA cases 
with presumed underlying Alzheimer pathology. Both AD groups displayed some
degree of anomia and impaired word comprehension but these were particularly
severe in lv-PPA and accompanied by a range of linguistic deficits, comprising
phonological substitutions, superordinate semantic paraphasias and abnormal
single-word repetition. Analysis of cortical thickness revealed that anomia was
correlated with thinning in left superior temporal gyrus in both groups. In
amnestic AD, however, anomia was also associated with thinning in right inferior 
temporal regions. Single-word comprehension (SWC), by contrast, was associated
with cortical thinning involving bilateral fusiform gyri in both groups. These
findings suggest that anomia in both amnestic AD and lv-PPA results from the
involvement at multiple steps of word processing, in particular, semantic and
lexical retrieval; in addition lv-PPA patients display a more marked involvement 
of phonological processing.

The exploration and retrieval of words during category fluency involves different
strategies to improve or maintain performance. Deficits in that task, which are
common in patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), mirror either 
impaired semantic memory or dysfunctional executive control mechanisms. Relating 
category fluency to tasks that place greater demands on either semantic knowledge
or executive functions might help to determine the underlying cognitive process. 
The aims of this study were to compare performance and strategy use of 20
patients with aMCI to 30 healthy elderly controls (HC) and to identify the
dominant component (either executive or semantic) for better task performance in 
category fluency. Thus, the relationship between category fluency, design fluency
and naming was examined. As fluency tasks have been associated with the superior 
frontal gyrus (SFG), the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and the temporal pole, we 
further explored the relationship between gray matter volume in these areas and
both performance and strategy use. Patients with aMCI showed significantly lower 
performance and significantly less strategy use during fluency tasks compared to 
HC. However, both groups equally improved their performance when repeatedly
confronted with the same task. In aMCI, performance during category fluency was
significantly predicted by design fluency performance, while in HC, it was
significantly predicted by naming performance. In HC, volume of the SFG
significantly predicted both category and design fluency performance, and
strategy use during design fluency. In aMCI, the SFG and the IFG predicted
performance during both category and design fluency. The IFG significantly
predicted strategy use during category fluency in both groups. The reduced
category fluency performance in aMCI seems to be primarily due to dysfunctional
executive control mechanisms rather than impaired semantic knowledge. This
finding is directly relevant to patients in the different stages of Alzheimer's
disease as it links the known semantic fluency deficit in this population to
executive functions. Although patients with aMCI are impaired in both performance
and strategy use compared to HC, they are able to increase performance over time.
However, only HC were able to significantly improve the utilization of fluency
strategies in both category and design fluency over time. HC seem to rely more
heavily on the SFG during fluency tasks, while in patients with aMCI additional
frontal brain areas are involved, possibly reflecting compensational processes.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) show impairment of episodic memory and
related metacognitive processes. The present study examined subjective
metacognitive judgments preceding objective memory retrieval and investigated the
neural correlates of pessimistic predictions for successfully retrieved memories 
in AD patients. AD patients and healthy older (HO) participants provided
predictive judgments on their recognition performance before retrieval of famous 
(semantic) and recently learned (episodic) names. Correlations between gray
matter volume (GMV) in T1 images and behavioral scores were examined with
multivariate (partial least square - PLS) and univariate (general linear model - 
GLM) analyses in AD patients. AD patients showed a significant proportion of
successful name recognition preceded by pessimistic prediction in episodic
memory. PLS revealed that the behavioral pattern in AD patients was related with 
a mainly right lateralized pattern of GMV decrease including medial temporal lobe
and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), but also right ventrolateral prefrontal
cortex (VLPFC). GLM further confirmed that pessimistic prediction negatively
correlated with GMV in VLPFC. Thus, impaired monitoring processes (possibly
influenced by inaccurate beliefs) allowing inferences about one's own memory
performance are primarily related to decrease GMV in VLPFC in AD patients.

The assessment of in vivo18F images targeting amyloid deposition is currently
carried on by visual rating with an optional quantification based on standardized
uptake value ratio (SUVr) measurements. We target the difficulties of image
reading and possible shortcomings of the SUVr methods by validating a new
semi-quantitative approach named ELBA. ELBA involves a minimal image
preprocessing and does not rely on small, specific regions of interest (ROIs). It
evaluates the whole brain and delivers a geometrical/intensity score to be used
for ranking and dichotomic assessment. The method was applied to adniimages
18F-florbetapir images from the ADNI database. Five expert readers provided
visual assessment in blind and open sessions. The longitudinal trend and the
comparison to SUVr measurements were also evaluated. ELBA performed with area
under the roc curve (AUC) = 0.997 versus the visual assessment. The score was
significantly correlated to the SUVr values (r = 0.86, p < 10-4). The
longitudinal analysis estimated a test/retest error of ≃2.3%. Cohort and
longitudinal analysis suggests that the ELBA method accurately ranks the brain
amyloid burden. The expert readers confirmed its relevance in aiding the visual
assessment in a significant number (85) of difficult cases. Despite the good
performance, poor and uneven image quality constitutes the major limitation.

Cognitive reserve (CR) is known to modulate the clinical features of Alzheimer's 
disease (AD). This concept may be critical for the development of
non-pharmacological interventions able to slow down patients' cognitive decline
in the absence of disease-modifying treatments. We aimed at identifying the
neurobiological substrates of CR (i.e., neural reserve) over the transition
between normal aging and AD, by assessing the underlying brain networks and their
topological properties. A cohort of 154 participants (n = 68 with AD, n = 61 with
amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), and 25 healthy subjects) underwent
resting-state functional MRI and neuropsychological testing. Within each group,
participants were classified as having high or low CR, and functional
connectivity measures were compared, within group, between high and low CR
individuals. Network-based statistics and topological network properties derived 
from graph theory were explored. Connectivity differences between high and low CR
were evident only for aMCI patients, with participants with high CR showing a
significant increase of connectivity in a network involving mainly
fronto-parietal nodes. Conversely, they showed significantly decreased
connectivity in a network involving fronto-temporo-cerebellar nodes.
Consistently, changes to topological measures were observed in either direction, 
and were associated with measures of global cognitive function. These findings
support the hypothesis that CR impacts on neurodegenerative process in the early 
phase of AD only. In addition, they fit with the existence of a "neural reserve",
characterized by specific neural networks and their efficiency. It remains to be 
demonstrated whether interventions later in life can modulate this "neural
reserve".

Purpose To investigate associations between neuroimaging markers of
cerebrovascular disease, including lesion topography and extent and severity of
strategic and global cerebral tissue injury, and cognition in carotid artery
disease (CAD). Materials and Methods All participants gave written informed
consent to undergo brain magnetic resonance imaging and the Addenbrooke's
Cognitive Examination-Revised. One hundred eight patients with symptomatic CAD
but no dementia were included, and a score less than 82 represented cognitive
impairment. Group comparison and interrelations between global cognitive and
fluency performance, lesion topography, and ultrastructural damage were assessed 
with voxel-based statistics. Associations between cognition, medial temporal lobe
atrophy (MTA), lesion volumes, and global white matter ultrastructural damage
indexed as increased mean diffusivity were tested with regression analysis by
controlling for age. Diagnostic accuracy of imaging markers selected from a
multivariate prediction model was tested with receiver operating characteristic
analysis. Results Cognitively impaired patients (n = 53 [49.1%], classified as
having probable vascular cognitive disorder) were older than nonimpaired patients
(P = .027) and had more frequent MTA (P < .001), more cortical infarctions (P =
.016), and larger volumes of acute (P = .028) and chronic (P = .009) subcortical 
ischemic lesions. Lesion volumes did not correlate with global cognitive
performance (lacunar infarctions, P = .060; acute lesions, P = .088; chronic
subcortical ischemic lesions, P = .085). In contrast, cognitive performance
correlated with presence of chronic ischemic lesions within the interhemispheric 
tracts and thalamic radiation (P < .05, false discovery rate corrected). Skeleton
mean diffusivity showed the closest correlation with cognition (R2 = 0.311, P <
.001) and promising diagnostic accuracy for vascular cognitive disorder (area
under the curve, 0.82 [95% confidence interval: 0.75, 0.90]). Findings were
confirmed in subjects with a low risk of preclinical Alzheimer disease indexed by
the absence of MTA (n = 85). Conclusion Subcortical white matter ischemic lesion 
locations and severity of ultrastructural tract damage contribute to cognitive
impairment in symptomatic CAD, which suggests that subcortical disconnection
within large-scale cognitive neural networks is a key mechanism of vascular
cognitive disorder. Online supplemental material is available for this article.

BACKGROUND: Memory impairment in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia
(bvFTD) is traditionally considered to be mild and attributed to prefrontal
cortex dysfunction. Recent studies, however, indicated that some patients can
present with a memory impairment of the hippocampal type, showing storage and
consolidation deficits in addition to the more executive/prefrontal related
encoding and strategic difficulties.
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to study the relationship between executive functions
(EF) and memory processes in bvFTD via a data-driven approach.
METHOD: Participants consisted of 71 bvFTD (among which 60.6% had a lumbar
puncture showing non-Alzheimer biomarker profile) and 60 controls (among which
45% had amyloid imaging showing a normal profile). EF were assessed by the
Frontal Assessment Battery, semantic/lexical verbal fluency tests, and
forward/backward digit spans. Patients were split into amnestic (n = 33) and
non-amnestic (n = 38) subgroups based on normative data (total recall score) from
the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT). Relationships between FCSRT
subscores and EF measures were explored through hierarchical clustering analysis,
partial correlation analysis with an EF component, and automated linear modeling.
RESULTS: Convergent findings across the statistical approaches show that,
overall, memory performance was independent from EF in bvFTD whereas the
relationship was stronger in controls. Indeed, in bvFTD, memory performance did
not cluster with EF, was not correlated with the EF component, and was only
partially (4% - 12.7%) predicted by EF.
DISCUSSION: These findings show that executive dysfunctions cannot solely explain
the memory deficits occurring in bvFTD. Indeed, some patients present with a
genuine amnesia affecting storage and consolidation abilities, which are
independent from executive dysfunctions. On the clinical level, this study
highlights the importance of revising the neuropsychological diagnosis criteria
for bvFTD.

The relationship of cortical structure and specific neuronal circuitry to global 
brain function, particularly its perturbations related to the development and
progression of neuropathology, is an area of great interest in neurobehavioral
science. Disruption of these neural networks can be associated with a wide range 
of neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Herein we review activity of the 
Default Mode Network (DMN) in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders,
including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Epilepsy (Temporal Lobe
Epilepsy - TLE), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and mood
disorders. We discuss the implications of DMN disruptions and their relationship 
to the neurocognitive model of each disease entity, the utility of DMN assessment
in clinical evaluation, and the changes of the DMN following treatment.

Computer Aided Diagnosis (CAD) constitutes an important tool for the early
diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD), which, in turn, allows the application of 
treatments that can be simpler and more likely to be effective. This paper
explores the construction of classification methods based on deep learning
architectures applied on brain regions defined by the Automated Anatomical
Labeling (AAL). Gray Matter (GM) images from each brain area have been split into
3D patches according to the regions defined by the AAL atlas and these patches
are used to train different deep belief networks. An ensemble of deep belief
networks is then composed where the final prediction is determined by a voting
scheme. Two deep learning based structures and four different voting schemes are 
implemented and compared, giving as a result a potent classification architecture
where discriminative features are computed in an unsupervised fashion. The
resulting method has been evaluated using a large dataset from the Alzheimer's
disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). Classification results assessed by
cross-validation prove that the proposed method is not only valid for
differentiate between controls (NC) and AD images, but it also provides good
performances when tested for the more challenging case of classifying Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI) Subjects. In particular, the classification
architecture provides accuracy values up to 0.90 and AUC of 0.95 for NC/AD
classification, 0.84 and AUC of 0.91 for stable MCI/AD classification and 0.83
and AUC of 0.95 for NC/MCI converters classification.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this volumetric study was to explore the neuroanatomical
correlates of the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test (FCSRT) and the Delayed 
Matching-to-Sample-48 items (DMS-48), two tests widely used in France to assess
verbal and visual anterograde memory. We wanted to determine to what extent the
two tests rely on the medial temporal lobe, and could therefore be predictive of 
Alzheimer's disease, in which pathological changes typically start in this
region.
METHODS: We analysed data from a cohort of 138 patients with mild cognitive
impairment participating in a longitudinal multicentre clinical research study.
Verbal memory was assessed using the FCSRT and visual recognition memory was
evaluated using the DMS-48. Performances on these two tests were correlated to
local grey matter atrophy via structural MRI using voxel-based morphometry.
RESULTS: Our results confirm the existence of a positive correlation between the 
volume of the medial temporal lobe and the performance on the FCSRT, prominently 
on the left, and the performance on the DMS-48, on the right, for the whole group
of patients (family-wise error, P < 0.05). Interestingly, this region remained
implicated only in the subgroup of patients who had deficient scores on the cued 
recall of the FCSRT, whereas the free recall was associated with prefrontal
aspects. For the DMS-48, it was only implicated for the group of patients whose
performances declined between the immediate and delayed trial. Conversely,
temporo-parietal cortices were implicated when no decline was observed. Within
the medial temporal lobe, the parahippocampal gyrus was prominently involved for 
the FCSRT and the immediate trial of the DMS-48, whereas the hippocampus was
solely involved for the delayed trial of the DMS-48.
CONCLUSIONS: The two tests are able to detect an amnestic profile of the medial
temporal type, under the condition that the scores remain deficient after the
cued recall of the FCSRT or decline on the delayed recognition trial of the
DMS-48. Strategic retrieval as well as perceptual/attentional processes,
supported by prefrontal and temporo-parietal cortices, were also found to have an
impact on the performances. Finally, the implication of the hippocampus appears
time dependent, triggered by a longer delay than the parahippocampus, rather than
determined by the sense of recollection or the encoding strength associated with 
the memory trace.

Resting-state functional connectivity (FC) is altered in Alzheimer's disease (AD)
but its predictive value for episodic memory impairment is debated. Here, we
aimed to assess whether resting-state FC in core brain regions activated during
memory-task functional magnetic resonance imaging is altered and predictive of
memory performance in AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI).
Twenty-three elderly cognitively healthy controls (HC), 76 aMCI subjects, and 19 
AD dementia patients were included. We computed resting-state FC between 18
meta-analytically determined peak coordinates of brain activation during
successful memory retrieval. Higher FC between the parahippocampus, parietal
cortex, and the middle frontal gyrus was observed in both AD and mild cognitive
impairment compared to HC (false-discovery rate-corrected p < 0.05). The increase
in FC between the parahippocampus and middle frontal gyrus was associated with
reduced episodic memory in aMCI, independent of amyloid-beta positron emission
tomography binding and apolipoprotein E ε4-carrier status. In conclusion,
increased parahippocampal-prefrontal FC is predictive of impaired episodic memory
in aMCI and may reflect a dysfunctional change within the episodic memory-related
neural network.

A novel technique of quantitative EEG for differentiating patients with
early-stage Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) from other forms of rapidly
progressive dementia (RPD) is proposed. The discrimination is based on the
extraction of suitable features from the time-frequency representation of the EEG
signals through continuous wavelet transform (CWT). An average measure of
complexity of the EEG signal obtained by permutation entropy (PE) is also
included. The dimensionality of the feature space is reduced through a multilayer
processing system based on the recently emerged deep learning (DL) concept. The
DL processor includes a stacked auto-encoder, trained by unsupervised learning
techniques, and a classifier whose parameters are determined in a supervised way 
by associating the known category labels to the reduced vector of high-level
features generated by the previous processing blocks. The supervised learning
step is carried out by using either support vector machines (SVM) or multilayer
neural networks (MLP-NN). A subset of EEG from patients suffering from
Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and healthy controls (HC) is considered for
differentiating CJD patients. When fine-tuning the parameters of the global
processing system by a supervised learning procedure, the proposed system is able
to achieve an average accuracy of 89%, an average sensitivity of 92%, and an
average specificity of 89% in differentiating CJD from RPD. Similar results are
obtained for CJD versus AD and CJD versus HC.

INTRODUCTION: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) increase the risk of
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Whether WMHs are associated with the decline of
functional neural networks in AD is debated.
METHOD: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and WMH were assessed
in 78 subjects with increased amyloid levels on AV-45 positron emission
tomography (PET) in different clinical stages of AD. We tested the association
between WMH volume in major atlas-based fiber tract regions of interest (ROIs)
and changes in functional connectivity (FC) between the tracts' projection areas 
within the default mode network (DMN).
RESULTS: WMH volume within the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus (IFOF) was
the highest among all tract ROIs and associated with reduced FC in IFOF-connected
DMN areas, independently of global AV-45 PET. Higher AV-45 PET contributed to
reduced FC in IFOF-connected, temporal, and parietal DMN areas.
CONCLUSIONS: High fiber tract WMH burden is associated with reduced FC in
connected areas, thus adding to the effects of amyloid pathology on neuronal
network function.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a very active Computer Science research field
aiming to develop systems that mimic human intelligence and is helpful in many
human activities, including Medicine. In this review we presented some examples
of the exploiting of AI techniques, in particular automatic classifiers such as
Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Classification
Tree (ClT) and ensemble methods like Random Forest (RF), able to analyze findings
obtained by positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission
tomography (SPECT) scans of patients with Neurodegenerative Diseases, in
particular Alzheimer's Disease. We also focused our attention on techniques
applied in order to preprocess data and reduce their dimensionality via feature
selection or projection in a more representative domain (Principal Component
Analysis - PCA - or Partial Least Squares - PLS - are examples of such methods); 
this is a crucial step while dealing with medical data, since it is necessary to 
compress patient information and retain only the most useful in order to
discriminate subjects into normal and pathological classes. Main literature
papers on the application of these techniques to classify patients with
neurodegenerative disease extracting data from molecular imaging modalities are
reported, showing that the increasing development of computer aided diagnosis
systems is very promising to contribute to the diagnostic process.

AIM: To investigate different proxies of brain and cognitive reserve as potential
mediators of the effect of cortical thinning on cognition in healthy middle-aged 
adults.
METHODS: Eighty-two middle-aged individuals were included (mean(SD)
age=45.1(3.9)years). Cortical thickness was calculated for multiple brain regions
using FreeSurfer. Cognitive measures sensitive to early cognitive decline were
selected, including Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III
(WAIS-III), Judgment of Line Orientation Test (JLOT), Color Trails Test (CTT),
and first learning trial of TAVEC (the Spanish version of the California Verbal
Learning Test, CVLT). Brain reserve was operationalized as total intracranial
volume (TIV); and cognitive reserve was estimated by means of Years of Education,
WAIS-III Vocabulary subtest, WAIS-III Information subtest, and a Cognitive
Reserve Questionnaire (CRQ). Mediation effects were investigated with multiple
linear regression and bootstrapping analysis.
RESULTS: Information and Vocabulary showed the greatest mediation capacity. All
the observed mediations were positive indicating that higher levels of reserve
attenuate the effect of reduced cortical thickness on cognition. Information,
Vocabulary and TIV buffered the effect of frontal thinning on Block Design;
Vocabulary and Years of Education buffered the effect of frontal thinning on
JLOT; and CRQ buffered the effect of temporal thinning on CTT.
CONCLUSION: Higher reserve buffers the effect of cortical thinning on cognition
in healthy middle-aged adults. The investigated proxies might be underpinned by
slightly different neural networks. Advancing in the understanding of the
influences of reserve in healthy middle-aged adults is crucial to facilitate
early interventions.

Normative data for volumetric estimates of brain structures are necessary to
adequately assess brain volume alterations in individuals with suspected
neurological or psychiatric conditions. Although many studies have described age 
and sex effects in healthy individuals for brain morphometry assessed via
magnetic resonance imaging, proper normative values allowing to quantify
potential brain abnormalities are needed. We developed norms for volumetric
estimates of subcortical brain regions based on cross-sectional magnetic
resonance scans from 2790 healthy individuals aged 18 to 94years using 23 samples
provided by 21 independent research groups. The segmentation was conducted using 
FreeSurfer, a widely used and freely available automated segmentation software.
Models predicting subcortical regional volumes of each hemisphere were produced
including age, sex, estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV), scanner
manufacturer, magnetic field strength, and interactions as predictors. The mean
explained variance by the models was 48%. For most regions, age, sex and eTIV
predicted most of the explained variance while manufacturer, magnetic field
strength and interactions predicted a limited amount. Estimates of the expected
volumes of an individual based on its characteristics and the scanner
characteristics can be obtained using derived formulas. For a new individual,
significance test for volume abnormality, effect size and estimated percentage of
the normative population with a smaller volume can be obtained. Normative values 
were validated in independent samples of healthy adults and in adults with
Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

Dementia is a growing problem that affects elderly people worldwide. More
accurate evaluation of dementia diagnosis can help during the medical
examination. Several methods for computer-aided dementia diagnosis have been
proposed using resonance imaging scans to discriminate between patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and healthy controls 
(NC). Nonetheless, the computer-aided diagnosis is especially challenging because
of the heterogeneous and intermediate nature of MCI. We address the automated
dementia diagnosis by introducing a novel supervised pretraining approach that
takes advantage of the artificial neural network (ANN) for complex classification
tasks. The proposal initializes an ANN based on linear projections to achieve
more discriminating spaces. Such projections are estimated by maximizing the
centered kernel alignment criterion that assesses the affinity between the
resonance imaging data kernel matrix and the label target matrix. As a result,
the performed linear embedding allows accounting for features that contribute the
most to the MCI class discrimination. We compare the supervised pretraining
approach to two unsupervised initialization methods (autoencoders and Principal
Component Analysis) and against the best four performing classification methods
of the 2014 CADDementia challenge. As a result, our proposal outperforms all the 
baselines (7% of classification accuracy and area under the
receiver-operating-characteristic curve) at the time it reduces the class
biasing.

Verbal fluency (VF) impairments occur early in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and to a 
lesser extent also in normal aging. However, the neural underpinnings of these
impairments are not fully understood. The present study evaluated whether VF
impairments in early AD and normal aging rely upon common or different
neuroanatomical correlates. We examined the association between VF performance
and brain structure in 18 mild AD patients and 24 healthy elderly. Linear
regressions were performed between accuracy and time intervals in VF scores and
structural measurements of cerebral gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) using 
MRI. Results showed that semantic VF correlated exclusively with GM in
cerebellum, left temporal fusiform cortex, and WM in uncinate fasciculus,
inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus and corpus callosum. Phonemic VF showed
unique associations between intervals and WM in left-hemisphere tracts. The
association between GM in hippocampus, subcortical structures and semantic
accuracy differentiated patients from controls. Results showed that VF
impairments are primarily associated with same structural brain changes in AD as 
in healthy elderly but at exaggerated levels. However, specific VF deficiencies
and their underlying neural correlates exist and these clearly differentiate the 
initial stages of AD.

Neuroimaging-based single subject prediction of brain disorders has gained
increasing attention in recent years. Using a variety of neuroimaging modalities 
such as structural, functional and diffusion MRI, along with machine learning
techniques, hundreds of studies have been carried out for accurate classification
of patients with heterogeneous mental and neurodegenerative disorders such as
schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. More than 500 studies have been published 
during the past quarter century on single subject prediction focused on a
multiple brain disorders. In the first part of this study, we provide a survey of
more than 200 reports in this field with a focus on schizophrenia, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), depressive disorders, autism spectrum
disease (ASD) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Detailed
information about those studies such as sample size, type and number of extracted
features and reported accuracy are summarized and discussed. To our knowledge,
this is by far the most comprehensive review of neuroimaging-based single subject
prediction of brain disorders. In the second part, we present our opinion on
major pitfalls of those studies from a machine learning point of view. Common
biases are discussed and suggestions are provided. Moreover, emerging trends such
as decentralized data sharing, multimodal brain imaging, differential diagnosis, 
disease subtype classification and deep learning are also discussed. Based on
this survey, there is extensive evidence showing the great potential of
neuroimaging data for single subject prediction of various disorders. However,
the main bottleneck of this exciting field is still the limited sample size,
which could be potentially addressed by modern data sharing models such as the
ones discussed in this paper. Emerging big data technologies and advanced
data-intensive machine learning methodologies such as deep learning have
coincided with an increasing need for accurate, robust and generalizable single
subject prediction of brain disorders during an exciting time. In this report, we
survey the past and offer some opinions regarding the road ahead.

The apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ɛ4 allele is a well-established genetic risk factor
for sporadic Alzheimer's disease. Some evidence suggests a negative role of the
ApoE ɛ4 allele for cognitive performance in late life, while beneficial effects
on cognition have been shown in young age. We investigated age-related effects of
the ApoE gene on brain function by assessing cognitive performance, as well as
functional activation patterns during retrieval of Face-Name pairs in a group of 
young (n = 50; age 26.4±4.6 years, 25 ɛ4 carriers) and old (n = 40; age 66.1±7.0 
years, 20 ɛ4 carriers) participants. A cross-sectional factorial design was used 
to examine the effects of age, ApoE genotype, and their interaction on both
cognitive performance and the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) brain
response during retrieval of Face-Name pairs. While there were no
genotype-related differences in cognitive performance, we found a significant
interaction of age and ApoE genotype on task-related activation bilaterally in
anterior cingulate gyrus and superior frontal gyrus, as well as left and right
insula. Old age was associated with increased activity in ɛ4 carriers. The
increased BOLD response in old ɛ4 carriers during retrieval could indicate a
neurocognitive disadvantage associated with the ɛ4 allele with increasing age.
Furthermore, recruitment of neuronal resources resulted in enhanced memory
performance in young ɛ4 carriers, pointing to a better neurofunctional capacity
associated with the ApoE4 genotype in young age.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a chronic neurodegenerative disease of the central
nervous system that has no cure and leads to death. One of the most prevalent
tools for AD diagnosis is magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), because of its
capability to visualize brain anatomical structures. There is a variety of
classification methods for automatic diagnosis of AD, such as support vector
machines, genetic algorithms, Bayes classifiers, neural networks, random forests,
etc., but none of them provides robust information about the stage of the AD,
they can just reveal the presence of disease. In this paper, a new approach for
classification of MRI images using a fuzzy inference system is proposed. Two
statistical moments (mean and standard deviation) of 116 anatomical regions of
interests (ROIs) are used as input features for the classification system. A
t-test feature selection method is used to identify the most discriminative ROIs.
In order to evaluate the proposed system, MRI images from a database consisting
of 818 subjects (229 normal, 401 mild cognitive impairment and 188 AD subjects)
collected from the Alzheimer's disease neuroimaging initiative (ADNI) is
analyzed. The receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve and the area under
the curve (AUC) of the proposed fuzzy inference system fed by statistical input
features are employed as the evaluation criteria with k-fold cross validation.
The proposed system yields promising results in normal vs. AD classification with
AUC of 0.99 on the training set and 0.8622±0.0033 on the testing set.

BACKGROUND: The logopenic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (lvPPA) is
associated with underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology and characterized
by impaired single word retrieval and repetition of phrases and sentences.
OBJECTIVE: We set out to study whether logopenic aphasia is indeed the prototypic
language profile in PPA patients with biomarker evidence of underlying AD
pathology and to correlate language profiles with cortical atrophy patterns on
MRI.
METHODS: Inclusion criteria: (I) clinical diagnosis of PPA; (II) CSF profile
and/or PiB-PET scan indicative for amyloid pathology; (III) availability of
expert language evaluation. Based on language evaluation, patients were
classified as lvPPA (fulfilling lvPPA core criteria), lvPPA extended (fulfilling 
core criteria plus other language disturbances), or PPA unclassifiable (not
fulfilling lvPPA core criteria). Cortical atrophy patterns on MRI were visually
rated and quantitative measurements of cortical thickness were performed using
FreeSurfer.
RESULTS: We included 22 patients (age 67±7 years, 50% female, MMSE 21±6). 41%
were classified as lvPPA, 36% as lvPPA extended with additional deficits in
language comprehension and/or confrontation naming, and 23% as PPA
unclassifiable. By both qualitative and quantitative measurements, patients with 
lvPPA showed mild global cortical atrophy on MRI, whereas patients with lvPPA
extended showed more focal cortical atrophy, predominantly at the left
tempo-parietal side. For PPA unclassifiable, qualitative measurements revealed a 
heterogeneous atrophy pattern.
CONCLUSION: Although most patients fulfilled the lvPPA criteria, we found that
their language profiles were heterogeneous. The clinical and radiological
spectrum of PPA due to underlying AD pathology is broader than pure lvPPA.

OBJECTIVES: The objective was to review the literature on diffusion tensor
imaging as well as resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and
electroencephalography (EEG) to unveil neuroanatomical and neurophysiological
substrates of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as a brain neural network pathology
affecting structural and functional cortical connectivity underlying human
cognition.
METHODS: We reviewed papers registered in PubMed and other scientific
repositories on the use of these techniques in amnesic mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI) and clinically mild AD dementia patients compared to cognitively intact
elderly individuals (Controls).
RESULTS: Hundreds of peer-reviewed (cross-sectional and longitudinal) papers have
shown in patients with MCI and mild AD compared to Controls (1) impairment of
callosal (splenium), thalamic, and anterior-posterior white matter bundles; (2)
reduced correlation of resting state blood oxygen level-dependent activity across
several intrinsic brain circuits including default mode and attention-related
networks; and (3) abnormal power and functional coupling of resting state
cortical EEG rhythms. Clinical applications of these measures are still limited.
CONCLUSIONS: Structural and functional (in vivo) cortical connectivity measures
represent a reliable marker of cerebral reserve capacity and should be used to
predict and monitor the evolution of AD and its relative impact on cognitive
domains in pre-clinical, prodromal, and dementia stages of AD.

BACKGROUND: Considering that Alzheimer's disease (AD) is untreatable, early
diagnosis of AD from the healthy elderly controls (HC) is pivotal. However,
computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems were not widely used due to its poor
performance.
OBJECTIVE: Inspired from the eigenface approach for face recognition problems, we
proposed an eigenbrain to detect AD brains. Eigenface is only for 2D image
processing and is not suitable for volumetric image processing since faces are
usually obtained as 2D images.
METHODS: We extended the eigenbrain to 3D. This 3D eigenbrain (3D-EB) inherits
the fundamental strategies in either eigenface or 2D eigenbrain (2D-EB). All the 
3D brains were transferred to a feature space, which encoded the variation among 
known 3D brain images. The feature space was named as the 3D-EB, and defined as
eigenvectors on the set of 3D brains. We compared four different classifiers:
feed-forward neural network, support vector machine (SVM) with linear kernel,
polynomial (Pol) kernel, and radial basis function kernel.
RESULTS: The 50x10-fold stratified cross validation experiments showed that the
proposed 3D-EB is better than the 2D-EB. SVM with Pol kernel performed the best
among all classifiers. Our "3D-EB + Pol-SVM" achieved an accuracy of 92.81% ±
1.99% , a sensitivity of 92.07% ± 2.48% , a specificity of 93.02% ± 2.22% , and a
precision of 79.03% ± 2.37% . Based on the most important 3D-EB U1, we detected
34 brain regions related with AD. The results corresponded to recent literature.
CONCLUSIONS: We validated the effectiveness of the proposed 3D-EB by detecting
subjects and brain regions related to AD.

Patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) develop progressive language,
visuoperceptual, attentional, and oculomotor changes that can have an impact on
their reading comprehension. However, few studies have examined reading behavior 
in AD, and none have examined the contribution of predictive cueing in reading
performance. For this purpose we analyzed the eye movement behavior of 35 healthy
readers (Controls) and 35 patients with probable AD during reading of regular and
high-predictable sentences. The cloze predictability of words N - 1, and N + 1
exerted an influence on the reader's gaze duration. The predictabilities of
preceding words in high-predictable sentences served as task-appropriate cues
that were used by Control readers. In contrast, these effects were not present in
AD patients. In Controls, changes in predictability significantly affected
fixation duration along the sentence; noteworthy, these changes did not affect
fixation durations in AD patients. Hence, only in healthy readers did
predictability of upcoming words influence fixation durations via memory
retrieval. Our results suggest that Controls used stored information of familiar 
texts for enhancing their reading performance and imply that contextual-word
predictability, whose processing is proposed to require memory retrieval, only
affected reading behavior in healthy subjects. In AD patients, this loss reveals 
impairments in brain areas such as those corresponding to working memory and
memory retrieval. These findings might be relevant for expanding the options for 
the early detection and monitoring in the early stages of AD. Furthermore,
evaluation of eye movements during reading could provide a new tool for measuring
drug impact on patients' behavior.

IMPORTANCE: Abnormal eating behaviors are common in patients with frontotemporal 
dementia (FTD), yet their exact prevalence, severity, and underlying biological
mechanisms are not understood.
OBJECTIVE: To define the severity of abnormal eating behavior and sucrose
preference and their neural correlates in patients with behavioral variant FTD
(bvFTD) and semantic dementia.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-nine patients with dementia (19 with
bvFTD, 15 with semantic dementia, and 15 with Alzheimer disease) were recruited, 
and their eating behavior was compared with that of 25 healthy controls. The
study was conducted from November 1, 2013, through May 31, 2015, and data
analyzed from June 1 to August 31, 2015.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Patients participated in an ad libitum breakfast test
meal, and their total caloric intake and food preferences were measured. Changes 
in eating behavior were also measured using the Appetite and Eating Habits
Questionnaire (APEHQ) and the Cambridge Behavioral Inventory (CBI). Sucrose
preference was tested by measuring liking ratings of 3 desserts of varying
sucrose content (A: 26%, B: 39%, C: 60%). Voxel-based morphometry analysis of
whole-brain 3-T high-resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging was used to
determine the gray matter density changes across groups and their relations to
eating behaviors.
RESULTS: Mean (SD) ages of patients in all 4 groups ranged from 62 (8.3) to 66
(8.4) years. At the ad libitum breakfast test meal, all patients with bvFTD had
increased total caloric intake (mean, 1344 calories) compared with the Alzheimer 
disease (mean, 710 calories), semantic dementia (mean, 573 calories), and control
groups (mean, 603 calories) (P < .001). Patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia
had a strong sucrose preference compared with the other groups. Increased caloric
intake correlated with atrophy in discrete neural networks that differed between 
patients with bvFTD and semantic dementia but included the cingulate cortices,
thalami, and cerebellum in patients with bvFTD, with the addition of the
orbitofrontal cortices and nucleus accumbens in patients with semantic dementia. 
A distributed network of neural correlates was associated with sucrose preference
in patients with FTD.
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Marked hyperphagia is restricted to bvFTD, present in 
all patients with this diagnosis, and supports its diagnostic value. Differing
neural networks control eating behavior in patients with bvFTD and semantic
dementia and are likely responsible for the differences seen, with a similar
network controlling sucrose preference. These networks share structures that
control cognitive-reward, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and visual modulation of
eating behavior. Delineating the neural networks involved in mediating these
changes in eating behavior may enable treatment of these features in patients
with complex medical needs and aid in our understanding of structures that
control eating behavior in patients with FTD and healthy individuals.

Work-related exposure to noise and other ototoxins can cause damage to the
cochlea, synapses between the inner hair cells, the auditory nerve fibers, and
higher auditory pathways, leading to difficulties in recognizing speech.
Procedures designed to determine speech recognition scores (SRS) in an objective 
manner can be helpful in disability compensation cases where the worker claims to
have poor speech perception due to exposure to noise or ototoxins. Such measures 
can also be helpful in determining SRS in individuals who cannot provide reliable
responses to speech stimuli, including patients with Alzheimer's disease,
traumatic brain injuries, and infants with and without hearing loss.
Cost-effective neural monitoring hardware and software is being rapidly refined
due to the high demand for neurogaming (games involving the use of brain-computer
interfaces), health, and other applications. More specifically, two related
advances in neuro-technology include relative ease in recording neural activity
and availability of sophisticated analysing techniques. These techniques are
reviewed in the current article and their applications for developing objective
SRS procedures are proposed. Issues related to neuroaudioethics (ethics related
to collection of neural data evoked by auditory stimuli including speech) and
neurosecurity (preservation of a person's neural mechanisms and free will) are
also discussed.

Although measurement of total hippocampal volume is considered as an important
hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD), recent evidence demonstrated that atrophies
of hippocampal subregions might be more sensitive in predicting this
neurodegenerative disease. The vast majority of neuroimaging papers investigating
this topic are focused on the difference between AD and patients with mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), not considering the impact of MCI patients who will
or not convert in AD. For this reason, the aim of this study was to determine if 
measurements of hippocampal subfields provide advantages over total hippocampal
volume for discriminating these groups. Hippocampal subfields volumetry was
extracted in 55 AD, 32 converted and 89 not-converted MCI (c/nc-MCI) and 47
healthy controls, using an atlas-based automatic algorithm based on Markov random
fields embedded in the Freesurfer framework. To evaluate the impact of
hippocampal atrophy in discriminating the insurgence of AD-like phenotypes we
used three classification methods: Support Vector Machine, Naïve Bayesian
Classifier and Neural Networks Classifier. Taking into account only the total
hippocampal volume, all classification models, reached a sensitivity of about 66%
in discriminating between c-MCI and nc-MCI. Otherwise, classification analysis
considering all segmenting subfields increased accuracy to diagnose c-MCI from
68% to 72%. This effect resulted to be strongly dependent upon atrophies of the
subiculum and presubiculum. Our multivariate analysis revealed that the magnitude
of the difference considering hippocampal subfield volumetry, as segmented by the
considered atlas-based automatic algorithm, offers an advantage over hippocampal 
volume in distinguishing early AD from nc-MCI.

There is a large body of research on discourse production in Alzheimer's disease 
(AD). Some studies have focused on pause production, revealing that patients make
extensive use of pauses during speech. This has been attributed to lexical
retrieval difficulties, but pausing may also reflect other forms of cognitive
impairment as it increases with cognitive load. The aim of the present study was 
to analyze autobiographical discourse impairment in AD from a broad perspective, 
looking at pausing behavior (frequency, duration, and location). Our first
objective was to characterize discourse changes in mild cognitive impairment
(MCI) due to AD. Our second objective was to determine the cognitive and
neuroanatomical correlates of these changes. Fifteen patients with MCI due to AD 
and 15 matched cognitively normal controls underwent an ecological episodic
memory task, a full neuropsychological assessment, and a 3D T1-weighted MRI
scans. Autobiographical discourse collected from the ecological episodic memory
task was recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, focusing on pausing. Intergroup
comparisons showed that although patients did not produce more pauses than
controls overall, they did make more between-utterance pauses. The number of
these specific pauses was positively correlated with patients' episodic memory
performance. Furthermore, neuroimaging analysis showed that, in the patient
group, their use was negatively correlated with frontopolar area (BA 10) grey
matter density. This region may therefore play an important role in the planning 
of autobiographical discourse production. These findings demonstrate that pauses 
in early AD may reflect a compensatory mechanism for improving mental time travel
and memory retrieval.

Functional brain abnormalities including memory loss are found to be associated
with pathological changes in connectivity and network neural structures.
Alzheimer's disease (AD) interferes with memory formation from the molecular
level, to synaptic functions and neural networks organization. Here, we
determined whether brain connectivity of resting-state networks correlate with
memory in patients affected by AD and in subjects with mild cognitive impairment 
(MCI). One hundred and forty-four subjects were recruited: 70 AD (MMSE Mini
Mental State Evaluation 21.4), 50 MCI (MMSE 25.2) and 24 healthy subjects (MMSE
29.8). Undirected and weighted cortical brain network was built to evaluate graph
core measures to obtain Small World parameters. eLORETA lagged linear
connectivity as extracted by electroencephalogram (EEG) signals was used to
weight the network. A high statistical correlation between Small World and memory
performance was found. Namely, higher Small World characteristic in EEG gamma
frequency band during the resting state, better performance in short-term memory 
as evaluated by the digit span tests. Such Small World pattern might represent a 
biomarker of working memory impairment in older people both in physiological and 
pathological conditions.

Analysis of spontaneous EEG activity in Alzheimer's disease using cross-sample
entropy and graph theory.

The aim of this pilot study was to analyze spontaneous electroencephalography
(EEG) activity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) by means of Cross-Sample Entropy
(Cross-SampEn) and two local measures derived from graph theory: clustering
coefficient (CC) and characteristic path length (PL). Five minutes of EEG
activity were recorded from 37 patients with dementia due to AD and 29 elderly
controls. Our results showed that Cross-SampEn values were lower in the AD group 
than in the control one for all the interactions among EEG channels. This finding
indicates that EEG activity in AD is characterized by a lower statistical
dissimilarity among channels. Significant differences were found mainly for
fronto-central interactions (p <; 0.01, permutation test). Additionally, the
application of graph theory measures revealed diverse neural network changes,
i.e. lower CC and higher PL values in AD group, leading to a less efficient brain
organization. This study suggests the usefulness of our approach to provide
further insights into the underlying brain dynamics associated with AD.

Episodic memory impairment represents one of the hallmark clinical features of
patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) attributable to the degeneration of medial
temporal and parietal regions of the brain. In contrast, a somewhat paradoxical
profile of relatively intact episodic memory, particularly for non-verbal
material, is observed in semantic dementia (SD), despite marked atrophy of the
hippocampus. This retrospective study investigated the neural substrates of
episodic memory retrieval in 20 patients with a diagnosis of SD and 21
disease-matched cases of AD and compared their performance to that of 35 age- and
education-matched healthy older Controls. Participants completed the Rey Complex 
Figure and the memory subscale of the Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination-Revised
as indices of visual and verbal episodic recall, respectively. Relative to
Controls, AD patients showed compromised memory performance on both visual and
verbal memory tasks. In contrast, memory deficits in SD were modality-specific
occurring exclusively on the verbal task. Controlling for semantic processing
ameliorated these deficits in SD, while memory impairments persisted in AD.
Voxel-based morphometry analyses revealed significant overlap in the neural
correlates of verbal episodic memory in AD and SD with predominantly anteromedial
regions, including the bilateral hippocampus, strongly implicated. Controlling
for semantic processing negated this effect in SD, however, a distributed network
of frontal, medial temporal, and parietal regions was implicated in AD. Our study
corroborates the view that episodic memory deficits in SD arise very largely as a
consequence of the conceptual loading of traditional tasks. We propose that the
functional integrity of frontal and parietal regions enables new learning to
occur in SD in the face of significant hippocampal and anteromedial temporal lobe
pathology, underscoring the inherent complexity of the episodic memory circuitry.

Atlas-based automated anatomical labeling is a fundamental tool in medical image 
segmentation, as it defines regions of interest for subsequent analysis of
structural and functional image data. The extensive investigation of multi-atlas 
warping and fusion techniques over the past 5 or more years has clearly
demonstrated the advantages of consensus-based segmentation. However, the common 
approach is to use multiple atlases with a single registration method and
parameter set, which is not necessarily optimal for every individual scan,
anatomical region, and problem/data-type. Different registration criteria and
parameter sets yield different solutions, each providing complementary
information. Herein, we present a consensus labeling framework that generates a
broad ensemble of labeled atlases in target image space via the use of several
warping algorithms, regularization parameters, and atlases. The label fusion
integrates two complementary sources of information: a local similarity ranking
to select locally optimal atlases and a boundary modulation term to refine the
segmentation consistently with the target image's intensity profile. The ensemble
approach consistently outperforms segmentations using individual warping methods 
alone, achieving high accuracy on several benchmark datasets. The MUSE
methodology has been used for processing thousands of scans from various
datasets, producing robust and consistent results. MUSE is publicly available
both as a downloadable software package, and as an application that can be run on
the CBICA Image Processing Portal (https://ipp.cbica.upenn.edu), a web based
platform for remote processing of medical images.

High-dimensional classification approaches have been widely used to investigate
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data for automatic classification of Alzheimer's
disease (AD). This paper describes the use of t-test based feature-ranking
approach as part of a novel feature selection procedure, where the number of top 
features is determined using the Fisher Criterion. The proposed classification
system involves five systematic levels. First, voxel-based morphometry technique 
is used to compare the global and local differences of gray matter in patients
with AD versus healthy controls (HCs). The significant local differences in gray 
matter volume are then selected as volumes of interests (VOIs). Second, the voxel
clusters are employed as VOIs, where each voxel is considered to be a feature.
Third, all the features are ranked using t-test scores. In this regard, the
Fisher Criterion between the AD and HC groups is calculated for a changing number
of ranked features, where the vector size maximizing the Fisher Criterion is
selected as the optimal number of top discriminative features. Fourth, the
classification is performed using support vector machine. Finally, data fusion
methods among atrophy clusters are used to improve the classification
performance. The experimental results indicate that the performance of the
proposed system could compete well with the state-of-the-art techniques reported 
in the literature.

OBJECTIVE: Differentially worse performance on category versus letter fluency
suggests greater semantic versus retrieval difficulties. This discrepancy,
combined with reduced episodic memory, has widespread clinical utility in
diagnosing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our objective was to investigate whether
changes in semantic processing, as measured by the discrepancy between category
and letter fluency, was detectable in preclinical AD: in clinically normal older 
adults with abnormal β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition on positron emission tomography
(PET) neuroimaging.
METHOD: Clinically normal older adults (mean Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE) score 
= 29) were classified as Aβ+ (n = 70) or Aβ- (n = 205) using Pittsburgh Compound 
B-(PET) imaging. Participants completed letter fluency (FAS; word generation to
letters F-A-S) and category fluency (CAT; word generation to animals, vegetables,
fruits) annually (mean follow-up = 2.42 years). The effect of Aβ status on
fluency over time was examined using linear mixed models controlling for age,
sex, and education. To dissociate effects related to semantic (CAT) versus
retrieval processes (CAT and FAS), we repeated models predicting CAT over time,
controlling for FAS and likewise for CAT controlling for FAS.
RESULTS: At baseline, the Aβ+ group performed better on FAS compared with the Aβ-
group but comparably on CAT. Longitudinally, the Aβ+ group demonstrated greater
decline on CAT compared with the Aβ- group (p = .0011). This finding remained
significant even when covarying for FAS (p = .0107). Aβ+ participants similarly
declined compared with Aβ- participants on FAS (p = .0112), but this effect
became insignificant when covarying for CAT (p = .1607).
CONCLUSION: These findings provide biomarker validation for the greater
specificity of declines in category versus letter fluency to underlying AD
pathology. Our results also suggest that changes in semantic processing occur
earlier in the AD trajectory than previously hypothesized. (PsycINFO Database

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a clinically, anatomically and biologically
heterogeneous disorder encompassing a wide spectrum of cognitive profiles,
ranging from the typical amnestic syndrome to visuospatial changes in posterior
cortical atrophy, language deficits in primary progressive aphasia and
behavioural/executive dysfunctions in anterior variants. With the emergence of
functional imaging and neural network analysis using graph theory for instance,
some authors have hypothesized that this phenotypic variability is produced by
the differential involvement of large-scale neural networks - a model called
'molecular nexopathy'. At the moment, however, the hypothesized mechanisms
underlying AD's divergent network degeneration remain speculative and mostly
involve selective premorbid network vulnerability. Herein we present an overview 
of AD's clinicoanatomical variability, outline functional imaging and graph
theory contributions to our understanding of the disease and discuss ongoing
debates regarding the biological roots of its heterogeneity. We finally discuss
the clinical promises of statistical signal processing disciplines (graph theory 
and information theory) in predicting the trajectory of AD variants. This paper
aims to raise awareness about AD clinicoanatomical heterogeneity and outline how 
statistical signal processing methods could lead to a better understanding,
diagnosis and treatment of AD variants in the future.

In this study we present a novel fully automated Hippocampal Unified
Multi-Atlas-Networks (HUMAN) algorithm for the segmentation of the hippocampus in
structural magnetic resonance imaging. In multi-atlas approaches atlas selection 
is of crucial importance for the accuracy of the segmentation. Here we present an
optimized method based on the definition of a small peri-hippocampal region to
target the atlas learning with linear and non-linear embedded manifolds. All
atlases were co-registered to a data driven template resulting in a
computationally efficient method that requires only one test registration. The
optimal atlases identified were used to train dedicated artificial neural
networks whose labels were then propagated and fused to obtain the final
segmentation. To quantify data heterogeneity and protocol inherent effects, HUMAN
was tested on two independent data sets provided by the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative and the Open Access Series of Imaging Studies. HUMAN is
accurate and achieves state-of-the-art performance (Dice[Formula: see text] and
Dice[Formula: see text]). It is also a robust method that remains stable when
applied to the whole hippocampus or to sub-regions (patches). HUMAN also compares
favorably with a basic multi-atlas approach and a benchmark segmentation tool
such as FreeSurfer.

Cortical and subcortical nuclei degenerate in the dementias, but less is known
about changes in the white matter tracts that connect them. To better understand 
white matter changes in behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) and
early-onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD), we used a novel approach to extract full 
3D profiles of fiber bundles from diffusion-weighted MRI (DWI) and map white
matter abnormalities onto detailed models of each pathway. The result is a
spatially complex picture of tract-by-tract microstructural changes. Our atlas of
tracts for each disease consists of 21 anatomically clustered and recognizable
white matter tracts generated from whole-brain tractography in 20 patients with
bvFTD, 23 with age-matched EOAD, and 33 healthy elderly controls. To analyze the 
landscape of white matter abnormalities, we used a point-wise tract
correspondence method along the 3D profiles of the tracts and quantified the
pathway disruptions using common diffusion metrics - fractional anisotropy, mean,
radial, and axial diffusivity. We tested the hypothesis that bvFTD and EOAD are
associated with preferential degeneration in specific neural networks. We mapped 
axonal tract damage that was best detected with mean and radial diffusivity
metrics, supporting our network hypothesis, highly statistically significant and 
more sensitive than widely studied fractional anisotropy reductions. From white
matter diffusivity, we identified abnormalities in bvFTD in all 21 tracts of
interest but especially in the bilateral uncinate fasciculus, frontal callosum,
anterior thalamic radiations, cingulum bundles and left superior longitudinal
fasciculus. This network of white matter alterations extends beyond the most
commonly studied tracts, showing greater white matter abnormalities in bvFTD
versus controls and EOAD patients. In EOAD, network alterations involved more
posterior white matter - the parietal sector of the corpus callosum and
parahipoccampal cingulum bilaterally. Widespread but distinctive white matter
alterations are a key feature of the pathophysiology of these two forms of
dementia.

The hippocampal complex is affected early in Alzheimer's disease (AD).
Increasingly, altered functional connectivity of the hippocampus is recognized as
an important feature of preclinical AD. Carriers of the APOEɛ4 allele are at an
increased risk for AD, which could lead to altered hippocampal connectivity even 
in healthy older adults. To test this hypothesis, we used a paired-associates
memory task to examine differences in task-dependent functional connectivity of
the anterior and posterior hippocampus in nondemented APOEɛ4 carriers (n = 34,
18F) and noncarriers (n = 46, 31F). We examined anterior and posterior portions
of the hippocampus separately to test the theory that APOEɛ4-mediated differences
would be more pronounced in the anterior region, which is affected earlier in the
AD course. This study is the first to use a psychophysiological interaction
approach to query the context-dependent connectivity of subregions of the
hippocampus during a memory task in adults at increased genetic risk for AD.
During encoding, APOEɛ4 carriers had lower functional connectivity change
compared to baseline between the anterior hippocampus and right precuneus,
anterior insula and cingulate cortex. During retrieval, bilateral supramarginal
gyrus and right precuneus showed lower functional connectivity change with
anterior hippocampus in carriers. Also during retrieval, carriers showed lower
connectivity change in the posterior hippocampus with auditory cortex. In each
case, APOEɛ4 carriers showed strong negative connectivity changes compared to
noncarriers where positive connectivity change was measured. These differences
may represent prodromal functional changes mediated in part by APOEɛ4 and are
consistent with the anterior-to-posterior theory of AD progression in the
hippocampus.

Conversational storytelling integrates diverse cognitive and socio-emotional
abilities that critically differ across neurodegenerative disease groups.
Storytelling patterns may have diagnostic relevance and predict anatomic changes.
The present study employed mixed methods discourse and quantitative analyses to
delineate patterns of storytelling across focal neurodegenerative disease groups,
and to clarify the neuroanatomical contributions to common storytelling
characteristics. Transcripts of spontaneous social interactions of 46
participants (15 behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), 7 semantic
variant primary progressive aphasia (svPPA), 12 Alzheimer's disease (AD), and 12 
healthy older normal controls (NC)) were analyzed for storytelling frequency and 
characteristics, and videos of the interactions were rated for patients' level of
social attentiveness. Compared to controls, svPPAs told more stories and
autobiographical stories, and perseverated on aspects of self during the
interaction, whereas ADs told fewer autobiographical stories than NCs. svPPAs and
bvFTDs were rated as less attentive to social cues. Aspects of storytelling were 
related to diverse cognitive and socio-emotional functions, and voxel-based
anatomic analysis of structural magnetic resonance imaging revealed that temporal
organization, narrative evaluations patterns, and social attentiveness correlated
with atrophy corresponding to known intrinsic connectivity networks, including
the default mode, limbic, salience, and stable task control networks. Differences
in spontaneous storytelling among neurodegenerative groups elucidated diverse
cognitive, socio-emotional, and neural contributions to narrative production,
with implications for diagnostic screening and therapeutic intervention.

Previous research has shown that there is considerable overlap in the neural
networks mediating successful memory encoding and retrieval. However, little is
known about how the relevant human brain regions interact during these distinct
phases of memory or how such interactions are affected by memory deficits that
characterize mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a condition that often precedes
dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Here we employed multivariate Granger
causality analysis using autoregressive modeling of inferred neuronal time series
obtained by deconvolving the hemodynamic response function from measured blood
oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) time series data, in order to examine the
effective connectivity between brain regions during successful encoding and/or
retrieval of object location associations in MCI patients and comparable healthy 
older adults. During encoding, healthy older adults demonstrated a left
hemisphere dominant pattern where the inferior frontal junction, anterior
intraparietal sulcus (likely involving the parietal eye fields), and posterior
cingulate cortex drove activation in most left hemisphere regions and virtually
every right hemisphere region tested. These regions are part of a frontoparietal 
network that mediates top-down cognitive control and is implicated in successful 
memory formation. In contrast, in the MCI patients, the right frontal eye field
drove activation in every left hemisphere region examined, suggesting reliance on
more basic visual search processes. Retrieval in the healthy older adults was
primarily driven by the right hippocampus with lesser contributions of the right 
anterior thalamic nuclei and right inferior frontal sulcus, consistent with
theoretical models holding the hippocampus as critical for the successful
retrieval of memories. The pattern differed in MCI patients, in whom the right
inferior frontal junction and right anterior thalamus drove successful memory
retrieval, reflecting the characteristic hippocampal dysfunction of these
patients. These findings demonstrate that neural network interactions differ
markedly between MCI patients and healthy older adults. Future efforts will
investigate the impact of cognitive rehabilitation of memory on these
connectivity patterns.

Repetitive traumatic brain injury (rTBI) occurs as a result of mild and
accumulative brain damage. A prototype of rTBI is chronic traumatic
encephalopathy (CTE), which is a degenerative disease that occurs in patients
with histories of multiple concussions or head injuries. Boxers have been the
most commonly studied patient group because they may experience thousands of
subconcussive hits over the course of a career. This study examined the
consequences of rTBI with structural brain imaging and biomolecular imaging and
investigated whether the neuropsychological features of rTBI were related to the 
findings of the imaging studies. Five retired professional boxers (mean age,
46.8 ± 3.19 years) and four age-matched controls (mean age, 48.5 ± 3.32 years)
were studied. Cognitive-motor related functional impairment was assessed, and all
subjects underwent neuropsychological evaluation and behavioral tasks, as well as
structural brain imaging and functional-molecular imaging. In neuropsychological 
tests, boxers showed deficits in delayed retrieval of visuospatial memory and
motor coordination, which had a meaningful relationship with biomolecular imaging
results indicative of neuronal injury. Morphometric abnormalities were not found 
in professional boxers by structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Glucose
metabolism was impaired in frontal areas associated with cognitive dysfunction,
similar to findings in Alzheimer's disease. Low binding potential (BP) of
(18)F-flumazenil (FMZ) was found in the angular gyrus and temporal cortical
regions, revealing neuronal deficits. These results suggested that cognitive
impairment and motor dysfunction reflect chronic damage to neurons in
professional boxers with rTBI.

BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, is a
progressive neurodegenerative disorder with interrelated molecular,
physiological, anatomical, biomarker, and cognitive dimensions.
METHODS: This article reviews the biological changes (genetic, molecular, and
cellular) underlying AD and their correlation with the clinical syndrome.
RESULTS: Dementia associated with AD is related to the aberrant production,
processing, and clearance of beta-amyloid and tau. Beta-amyloid deposition in
brain follows a distinct spatial progression starting in the basal neocortex,
spreading throughout the hippocampus, and eventually spreading to the rest of the
cortex. The spread of tau pathology through neural networks leads to a distinct
and consistent spatial progression of neurofibrillary tangles, beginning in the
transentorhinal and hippocampal region and spreading superolaterally to the
primary areas of the neocortex. Synaptic dysfunction and cell death is shown by
progressive loss of cerebral metabolic rate for glucose and progressive brain
atrophy. Decreases in synapse number in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus
correlate with declining cognitive function. Amyloid changes are detectable in
cerebrospinal fluid and with amyloid imaging up to 20 years prior to the onset of
symptoms. Structural atrophy may be detectable via magnetic resonance imaging up 
to 10 years before clinical signs appear.
CONCLUSION: This review highlights the progression of biological changes
underlying AD and their association with the clinical syndrome. Many changes
occur before overt symptoms are evident and biomarkers provide a means to detect 
AD pathology even in patients without symptoms.

FFQ are commonly used to examine the association between diet and disease. They
are the most practical method for usual dietary data collection as they are
relatively inexpensive and easy to administer. In Australia, the Cancer Council
of Victoria FFQ (CCVFFQ) version 2 and the online Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organisation FFQ (CSIROFFQ) are used. The aim of our study
was to establish the level of agreement between nutrient intakes captured using
the online CSIROFFQ and the paper-based CCVFFQ. The CCVFFQ and the online
CSIROFFQ were completed by 136 healthy participants. FFQ responses were analysed 
to give g per d intake of a range of nutrients. Agreement between twenty-six
nutrient intakes common to both FFQ was measured by a variety of methods.
Nutrient intake levels that were significantly correlated between the two FFQ
were carbohydrates, total fat, Na and MUFA. When assessing ranking of nutrients
into quintiles, on average, 56 % of the participants (for all nutrients) were
classified into the same or adjacent quintiles in both FFQ, with the highest
percentage agreement for sugar. On average, 21 % of participants were grossly
misclassified by three or four quintiles, with the highest percentage
misclassification for fibre and Fe. Quintile agreement was similar to that
reported by other studies, and we concluded that both FFQ are suitable tools for 
dividing participants' nutrient intake levels into high- and low-consumption
groups. Use of either FFQ was not appropriate for obtaining accurate estimates of
absolute nutrient intakes.

BACKGROUND: The choice of biomarkers for early detection of Alzheimer's disease
(AD) is important for improving the accuracy of imaging-based prediction of
conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to AD. The primary goal of this
study was to assess the effects of imaging modalities and brain atlases on
prediction. We also investigated the influence of support vector machine
recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) on predictive performance.
METHODS: Eighty individuals with amnestic MCI [40 developed AD within 3 years]
underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
(18)F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) scans at
baseline. Using Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) and LONI Probabilistic Brain 
Atlas (LPBA40), we extracted features representing gray matter density and
relative cerebral metabolic rate for glucose in each region of interest from the 
baseline MRI and FDG-PET data, respectively. We used linear SVM ensemble with
bagging and computed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) as a measure of classification performance. We performed multiple SVM-RFE
to compute feature ranking. We performed analysis of variance on the mean AUCs
for eight feature sets.
RESULTS: The interactions between atlas and modality choices were significant.
The main effect of SVM-RFE was significant, but the interactions with the other
factors were not significant.
COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHOD: Multimodal features were found to be better than
unimodal features to predict AD. FDG-PET was found to be better than MRI.
CONCLUSIONS: Imaging modalities and brain atlases interact with each other and
affect prediction. SVM-RFE can improve the predictive accuracy when using
atlas-based features.

Age-related cognitive changes often include difficulties in retrieving memories, 
particularly those that rely on personal experiences within their temporal and
spatial contexts (i.e., episodic memories). This decline may vary depending on
the studied phase (i.e., encoding, storage or retrieval), according to
inter-individual differences, and whether we are talking about normal or
pathological (e.g., Alzheimer disease; AD) aging. Such cognitive changes are
associated with different structural and functional alterations in the human
neural network that underpins episodic memory. The prefrontal cortex is the first
structure to be affected by age, followed by the medial temporal lobe (MTL), the 
parietal cortex and the cerebellum. In AD, however, the modifications occur
mainly in the MTL (hippocampus and adjacent structures) before spreading to the
neocortex. In this review, we will present results that attempt to characterize
normal and pathological cognitive aging at multiple levels by integrating
structural, behavioral, inter-individual and neuroimaging measures of episodic
memory.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most
common type of dementia among older people. The number of patients with AD will
grow rapidly each year and AD is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 
65 and older. In recent years, one of the main challenges for medical
investigators has been the early diagnosis of patients with AD because an early
diagnosis can provide greater opportunities for patients to be eligible for more 
clinical trials and they will have enough time to plan for future, medical and
financial decisions. An established risk factor for AD is mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) which is described as a transitional state between normal aging 
and AD patients. Hence an accurate and reliable diagnosis of MCI can be very
effective and helpful for early diagnosis of AD. Therefore in this paper we
present a novel and efficient method based on pseudo Zernike moments (PZMs) for
the diagnosis of MCI individuals from AD and healthy control (HC) groups using
structural MRI. The proposed method uses PZMs to extract discriminative
information from the MR images of the AD, MCI, and HC groups. Two types of
artificial neural networks, which are based on pattern recognition and learning
vector quantization (LVQ) networks, were used to classify the information
extracted from the MRIs. We worked with 500 MRIs from the database of the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI 1 1.5T). The 1 slice of 500
MRIs used in this study included 180 AD patients, 172 MCI patients, and 148 HC
individuals. We selected 50 percent of the MRIs randomly for use in training the 
classifiers, 25 percent for validation and we used 25 percent for the testing
phase. The technique proposed here yielded the best overall classification
results between AD and MCI (accuracy 94.88%, sensitivity 94.18%, and specificity 
95.55%), and for pairs of the MCI and HC (accuracy 95.59%, sensitivity 95.89% and
specificity 95.34%). These results were achieved using maximum order 30 of PZM
and the pattern recognition network with the scaled conjugate gradient (SCG)
back-propagation training algorithm as a classifier.

In the past 5 years, imaging network properties in the brain of patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD) has revolutionized our understanding of this disorder.
Postmortem data had already suggested that the damage spreads along functional
neural networks, but postmortem studies do not provide information on the
temporal evolution of the damage in the same patient, essential to determine
spreading. These data can be provided by functional and structural neuroimaging, 
which allow for the visualization over time of the progressive damage inflicted
by AD. Functional networks can be mapped by determining the synchrony across
brain regions of the blood oxygenation level dependence (BOLD) signal on
functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) during quiet wakefulness. Other less 
extensively used techniques are also useful. For instance, amyloid deposition can
be imaged and its progression mapped to determine whether it follows brain
networks, and, if so, which are affected earliest. Network patterns of
neurobiological changes, including tau deposition, may prove critical to our
understanding of the neurobiology of AD and therefore open the way for
therapeutic interventions.

OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to test whether disturbed EEG resting-state 
functional connectivity and network organization are a potential
neurophysiological substrate of cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy
bodies.
METHODS: EEG recordings were obtained in dementia with Lewy bodies patients,
Alzheimer's disease patients and controls, matched for age and sex (N = 66 for
each group; 14 [21%] female; mean age: 70 years). We analyzed functional
connectivity of band-filtered EEG time series using the phase lag index.
Functional brain network topology was analyzed with the minimum spanning tree.
Mini-Mental State Examination, Trail Making Test A, and Visual Association Test
were used as cognitive measures.
RESULTS: Dementia with Lewy bodies patients showed lower connectivity strength in
the alpha frequency band, compared to both controls and Alzheimer's disease
patients (P < 0.001). Functional network topology in dementia with Lewy bodies
patients was less efficient and contained less hubs (P < 0.01). Network
characteristics in Alzheimer's disease patients were in between (but did not
differ from) those of the other two groups. In dementia with Lewy bodies
patients, lower alpha band phase lag index correlated with Visual Association
Test scores and Trail Making Test scores (ρ = 0.33 and ρ = 0.31, respectively),
whereas leaf fraction (a measure of 'network efficiency') correlated with Visual 
Association Test scores (ρ = 0.29) and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (ρ = 
0.27).
CONCLUSION: Functional networks of dementia with Lewy bodies patients are
characterized by decreased connectivity strength and a loss of network efficiency
and hubs. Severity of these disturbances is related to cognitive impairment,
suggesting that network disturbances mediate between neuropathology and the
clinical syndrome in dementia with Lewy bodies.

We compared specific (i.e., associated with a unique time and space) and general 
(i.e., extended or repeated events) autobiographical memories (AbM) in
Alzheimer's disease (AD). The comparison aims at investigating the relationship
between these two components of AbM across the lifespan and the volume of
cerebral regions of interest within the temporal lobe. We hypothesized that the
ability to elicit specific memories would correlate with hippocampal volume,
whereas evoking general memories would be related to lateral temporal lobe. AbM
was assessed using the modified Crovitz test in 18 patients with early AD and 18 
matched controls. The proportions of total memories-supposed to reflect the
ability to produce general memories-and specific memories retrieved were compared
between AD patients and controls. Correlations to MRI volumes of temporal cortex 
were tested. We found different temporal patterns for specific and general
memories in AD patients, with (i) relatively spared general memories, according
to a temporal gradient that preserved remote memories, predominantly associated
with right lateral temporal cortex volume. (ii) Conversely, the retrieval of
specific AbMs was impaired for all life periods and correlated with bilateral
hippocampal volumes. Our results highlight a shift from an initially episodic to 
a semantic nature of AbMs during AD, where the abstracted form of memories
remains.

Impairments of word recognition in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have been less widely
investigated than impairments affecting word retrieval and production. In
particular, we know little about what makes individual words easier or harder for
patients with AD to recognize. We used a lexical selection task in which
participants were shown sets of four items, each set consisting of one word and
three non-words. The task was simply to point to the word on each trial. Forty
patients with mild-to-moderate AD were significantly impaired on this task
relative to matched controls who made very few errors. The number of patients
with AD able to recognize each word correctly was predicted by the frequency, age
of acquisition, and imageability of the words, but not by their length or number 
of orthographic neighbours. Patient Mini-Mental State Examination and
phonological fluency scores also predicted the number of words recognized. We
propose that progressive degradation of central semantic representations in AD
differentially affects the ability to recognize low-imageability, low-frequency, 
late-acquired words, with the same factors affecting word recognition as
affecting word retrieval.

Deficits in autobiographical memory appear earlier for recent than for remote
life periods over the course of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The present study aims 
to further our understanding of this graded effect by investigating the cognitive
and neural substrates of recent versus remote autobiographical memories in
patients with amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment (aMCI) thanks to an
autobiographical fluency task. 20 aMCI patients and 25 Healthy elderly Controls
(HC) underwent neuropsychological tests assessing remote (20-to-30 years old) and
recent (the ten last years) autobiographical memory as well as episodic and
semantic memory, executive function and global cognition. All patients also had a
structural MRI and an FDG-PET scan. Correlations were assessed between each
autobiographical memory score and the other tests as well as grey matter volume
and metabolism. Within the aMCI, performances for the remote period correlated
with personal semantic memory and episodic memory retrieval whereas performances 
for the recent period only correlated with episodic memory retrieval.
Neuroimaging analyses revealed significant correlations between performances for 
the remote period and temporal pole and temporo-parietal cortex volumes and
anterior cingulate gyrus metabolism, while performances for the recent period
correlated with hippocampal volume and posterior cingulate, medial prefrontal and
hippocampus metabolism. The brain regions related with the retrieval of events
from the recent period showed greater atrophy/hypometabolism in aMCI patients
compared to HC than those involved in remote memories. Recall of recent memories 
essentially relies on episodic memory processes and brain network while remote
memories also involve other processes such as semantic memory. This is consistent
with the semanticization of memories with time and may explain the better
resistance of remote memory in AD.

The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may be
optimal for clinical trials to test potential treatments for preventing or
delaying decline to dementia. However, MCI is heterogeneous in that not all cases
progress to dementia within the time frame of a trial and some may not have
underlying AD pathology. Identifying those MCIs who are most likely to decline
during a trial and thus most likely to benefit from treatment will improve trial 
efficiency and power to detect treatment effects. To this end, using multimodal, 
imaging-derived, inclusion criteria may be especially beneficial. Here, we
present a novel multimodal imaging marker that predicts future cognitive and
neural decline from [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET), 
amyloid florbetapir PET, and structural magnetic resonance imaging, based on a
new deep learning algorithm (randomized denoising autoencoder marker, rDAm).
Using ADNI2 MCI data, we show that using rDAm as a trial enrichment criterion
reduces the required sample estimates by at least five times compared with the
no-enrichment regime and leads to smaller trials with high statistical power,
compared with existing methods.

Recently, several pattern recognition methods have been proposed to automatically
discriminate between patients with and without Alzheimer's disease using
different imaging modalities: sMRI, fMRI, PET and SPECT. Classical approaches in 
visual information retrieval have been successfully used for analysis of
structural MRI brain images. In this paper, we use the visual indexing framework 
and pattern recognition analysis based on structural MRI data to discriminate
three classes of subjects: normal controls (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) 
and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The approach uses the circular harmonic functions
(CHFs) to extract local features from the most involved areas in the disease:
hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in each slice in all three brain
projections. The features are quantized using the Bag-of-Visual-Words approach to
build one signature by brain (subject). This yields a transformation of a full 3D
image of brain ROIs into a 1D signature, a histogram of quantized features. To
reduce the dimensionality of the signature, we use the PCA technique. Support
vector machines classifiers are then applied to classify groups. The experiments 
were conducted on a subset of ADNI dataset and applied to the "Bordeaux-3City"
dataset. The results showed that our approach achieves respectively for ADNI
dataset and "Bordeaux-3City" dataset; for AD vs NC classification, an accuracy of
83.77% and 78%, a specificity of 88.2% and 80.4% and a sensitivity of 79.09% and 
74.7%. For NC vs MCI classification we achieved for the ADNI datasets an accuracy
of 69.45%, a specificity of 74.8% and a sensitivity of 62.52%. For the most
challenging classification task (AD vs MCI), we reached an accuracy of 62.07%, a 
specificity of 75.15% and a sensitivity of 49.02%. The use of PCC visual features
description improves classification results by more than 5% compared to the use
of hippocampus features only. Our approach is automatic, less time-consuming and 
does not require the intervention of the clinician during the disease diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: Gender differences and menopause are associated with the cognitive 
decline and pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although deficits of
subcortical-cortical loops have been implicated in AD, no study has directly
examined the resting-state brain functional alterations in postmenopausal women
with mild cognitive impairment (MCI).
METHODOLOGY: Forty-eight subjects were recruited, including 15 older females with
MCI, 13 older females without MCI, 10 older males with MCI and 10 older males
without MCI. Full-scale neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate cognitive 
function. Resting-state fMRI and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation
(ALFF) approach were used to investigate changes in the brain function in these
subjects. A voxel-wise analysis of variance (ANOVA: gender × disease) was
performed, and gender-brain-behavior relationships were further examined.
RESULTS: First, older females with MCI showed cognitive dysfunction in multiple
domains compared to normal controls. Second, the brain function of
subcortical-cortical loops was disrupted in older females with MCI. Finally,
regional resting-state function of the left precuneus was significantly
associated with altered episodic memory in these female patients.
CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed the patterns of neural networks in older females
with cognitive disorders, and may provide new ideas and evidence regarding the
mechanism of cognitive impairment in postmenopausal women.

Compromised retrieval of autobiographical memory (ABM) is well established in
neurodegenerative disorders. The recounting of autobiographical events is
inextricably linked to linguistic knowledge, yet no study to date has
investigated whether tense use during autobiographical narration is disrupted in 
dementia syndromes. This study investigated the incidence of correct past tense
use during ABM narration in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD, n = 10) and
semantic dementia (SD, n = 10) in comparison with healthy older Controls
(n = 10). Autobiographical narratives were analysed for episodic content
(internal/external) and classified according to tense use (past/present). Across 
both patient groups, use of the past tense was significantly compromised relative
to Controls, with increased levels of off-target present tense verbs observed.
Voxel-based morphometry analyses based on structural MRI revealed differential
associations between past tense use and regions of grey matter intensity in the
brain. Bilateral temporal cortices were implicated in the SD group, whereas
frontal, lateral, and medial temporal regions including the right hippocampus
emerged in AD. This preliminary study provides the first demonstration of the
disruption of specific linguistic constructs during autobiographical narration in
AD and SD. Future studies are warranted to clarify at what point in the disease
trajectory such deficits in tense use emerge, and whether these deficits are a
product or contributing factor in memory disruption in these syndromes.

OBJECTIVE: This paper proposes a new, complex algorithm for the blind
classification of the original electroencephalogram (EEG) tracing of each
subject, without any preliminary pre-processing. The medical need in this field
is to reach an early differential diagnosis between subjects affected by mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), early Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the healthy
elderly (CTR) using only the recording and the analysis of few minutes of their
EEG.
METHODS AND MATERIAL: This study analyzed the EEGs of 272 subjects, recorded at
Rome's Neurology Unit of the Policlinico Campus Bio-Medico. The EEG recordings
were performed using 19 electrodes, in a 0.3-70Hz bandpass, positioned according 
to the International 10-20 System. Many powerful learning machines and algorithms
have been proposed during the last 20 years to effectively resolve this complex
problem, resulting in different and interesting outcomes. Among these algorithms,
a new artificial adaptive system, named implicit function as squashing time
(I-FAST), is able to diagnose, with high accuracy, a few minutes of the subject's
EEG track; whether it manifests an AD, MCI or CTR condition. An updating of this 
system, carried out by adding a new algorithm, named multi scale ranked
organizing maps (MS-ROM), to the I-FAST system, is presented, in order to
classify with greater accuracy the unprocessed EEG's of AD, MCI and control
subjects.
RESULTS: The proposed system has been measured on three independent pattern
recognition tasks from unprocessed EEG tracks of a sample of AD subjects, MCI
subjects and CTR: (a) AD compared with CTR; (b) AD compared with MCI; (c) CTR
compared with MCI. While the values of accuracy of the previous system in
distinguishing between AD and MCI were around 92%, the new proposed system
reaches values between 94% and 98%. Similarly, the overall accuracy with best
artificial neural networks (ANNs) is 98.25% for the distinguishing between CTR
and MCI.
CONCLUSIONS: This new version of I-FAST makes different steps forward: (a)
avoidance of pre-processing phase and filtering procedure of EEG data, being the 
algorithm able to directly process an unprocessed EEG; (b) noise elimination,
through the use of a training variant with input selection and testing system,
based on naïve Bayes classifier; (c) a more robust classification phase, showing 
the stability of results on nine well known learning machine algorithms; (d)
extraction of spatial invariants of an EEG signal using, in addition to the
unsupervised ANN, the principal component analysis and the multi scale entropy,
together with the MS-ROM; a more accurate performance in this specific task.

A Robust Deep Model for Improved Classification of AD/MCI Patients.

Li F, Tran L, Thung KH, Ji S, Shen D, Li J.

Accurate classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), plays a critical role in possibly preventing
progression of memory impairment and improving quality of life for AD patients.
Among many research tasks, it is of a particular interest to identify noninvasive
imaging biomarkers for AD diagnosis. In this paper, we present a robust deep
learning system to identify different progression stages of AD patients based on 
MRI and PET scans. We utilized the dropout technique to improve classical deep
learning by preventing its weight coadaptation, which is a typical cause of
overfitting in deep learning. In addition, we incorporated stability selection,
an adaptive learning factor, and a multitask learning strategy into the deep
learning framework. We applied the proposed method to the ADNI dataset, and
conducted experiments for AD and MCI conversion diagnosis. Experimental results
showed that the dropout technique is very effective in AD diagnosis, improving
the classification accuracies by 5.9% on average as compared to the classical

Episodic memory (EM) dysfunction is a central characteristic of amnestic mild
cognitive impairment (aMCI) subjects, and has a high risk of converting to
Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, it is unknown how the EM network is modulated 
when a situation is switched. Twenty-six aMCI and twenty-two cognitively normal
(CN) subjects were enrolled in this study. All of the subjects completed
multi-dimensional neuropsychological tests and underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging scans during a resting-state and an episodic memory retrieval
task state. The EM network was constructed using a seed-based functional
connectivity (FC) approach. AMCI subjects showed poorer cognitive performances in
the episodic memory and executive function. We demonstrated that connectivity of 
the left posterior parahippocampal gyrus (LpPHG) connected to the left ventral
medial prefrontal cortex and the right postcentral gyrus (RPCG) was significantly
decreased in aMCI subjects compared to CN subjects. Meanwhile, there was
increased connectivity of the LpPHG to the right dorsal medial prefrontal cortex 
(RDMPFC), RPCG, left inferior parietal cortex, and bilateral superior parietal
lobe in all of the subjects that changed from a resting-state to a task-state.
Interestingly, the changed LpPHG-RDMPFC connectivity strength was significantly
correlated with EM scores and executive function in the aMCI subjects. As a
result, general brain regions are functionally organized and integrated into the 
EM network, and this strongly suggests that more cognitive resources are
mobilized to meet the challenge of cognitive demand in the task state. These
findings extend our understanding of the underlying mechanisms of EM deficits in 
aMCI subjects.

PURPOSE: The ε4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APO-E4) gene, a genetic risk
factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), also modulates brain metabolism and function
in healthy subjects. The aim of the present study was to explore cerebral
metabolism using FDG PET in healthy APO-E4 carriers by comparing cognitively
normal APO-E4 carriers to noncarriers and to assess if patterns of metabolism are
correlated with performance on cognitive tasks. Moreover, metabolic connectivity 
patterns were established in order to assess if the organization of neural
networks is influenced by genetic factors.
METHODS: Whole-brain PET statistical analysis was performed at voxel-level using 
SPM8 with a threshold of p < 0.005, corrected for volume, with age, gender and
level of education as nuisance variables. Significant hypometabolism between
APO-E4 carriers (n = 11) and noncarriers (n = 30) was first determined. Mean
metabolic values with clinical/neuropsychological data were extracted at the
individual level, and correlations were searched using Spearman's rank test in
the whole group. To evaluate metabolic connectivity from metabolic cluster(s)
previously identified in the intergroup comparison, voxel-wise interregional
correlation analysis (IRCA) was performed between groups of subjects.
RESULTS: APO-E4 carriers had reduced metabolism within the left anterior medial
temporal lobe (MTL), where neuropathological changes first appear in AD,
including the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices. A correlation between
metabolism in this area and performance on the DMS48 (delayed matching to
sample-48 items) was found, in line with converging evidence involving the
perirhinal cortex in object-based memory. Finally, a voxel-wise IRCA revealed
stronger metabolic connectivity of the MTL cluster with neocortical
frontoparietal regions in carriers than in noncarriers, suggesting compensatory
metabolic networks.
CONCLUSION: Exploring cerebral metabolism using FDG PET can contribute to a
better understanding of the influence of genetic factors on cerebral metabolism
at both the local and network levels leading to phenotypical variations of the
healthy brain and selective vulnerability.

Deficits in semantic memory in individuals with amnestic mild cognitive
impairment (aMCI) have been previously reported, but the underlying
neurobiological mechanisms remain to be clarified. We examined event-related
potentials (ERPs) associated with semantic memory retrieval in 16 individuals
with aMCI as compared to 17 normal controls using the Semantic Object Retrieval
Task (EEG SORT). In this task, subjects judged whether pairs of words (object
features) elicited retrieval of an object (retrieval trials) or not
(non-retrieval trials). Behavioral findings revealed that aMCI subjects had lower
accuracy scores and marginally longer reaction time compared to controls. We used
a multivariate analytical technique (STAT-PCA) to investigate similarities and
differences in ERPs between aMCI and control groups. STAT-PCA revealed a left
fronto-temporal component starting at around 750 ms post-stimulus in both groups.
However, unlike controls, aMCI subjects showed an increase in the
frontal-parietal scalp potential that distinguished retrieval from non-retrieval 
trials between 950 and 1050 ms post-stimulus negatively correlated with the
performance on the logical memory subtest of the Wechsler Memory Scale-III. Thus,
individuals with aMCI were not only impaired in their behavioral performance on
SORT relative to controls, but also displayed alteration in the corresponding
ERPs. The altered neural activity in aMCI compared to controls suggests a more
sustained and effortful search during object memory retrieval, which may be a
potential marker indicating disease processes at the pre-dementia stage.

The hippocampus is a very important structure in memory formation and retrieval, 
as well as in various neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease,
epilepsy and depression. It is composed of many intricate subregions making it
difficult to study the anatomical changes that take place during disease. The
hippocampal hilus may have a unique neuroanatomy in humans compared to that in
monkeys and rodents, with field CA3h greatly enlarged in humans compared to that 
in rodents, and a white-matter pathway, called the endfolial pathway, possibly
only present in humans. In this study we have used newly developed 7.0T whole
brain imaging sequence, balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP) that can
achieve 0.4mm isotropic images to study, in vivo, the anatomy of the hippocampal 
hilus. A detailed hippocampal subregional segmentation was performed according to
anatomic atlases segmenting the following regions: CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, SRLM
(stratum radiatum lacunosum moleculare), alveus, fornix, and subiculum along with
its molecular layer. We also segmented a hypointense structure centrally within
the hilus that resembled the endfolial pathway. To validate that this hypointense
signal represented the endfolial pathway, we acquired 0.1mm isotropic 8-phase
cycle bSSFP on an excised specimen, and then sectioned and stained the specimen
for myelin using an anti-myelin basic protein antibody (SMI 94). A structure
tensor analysis was calculated on the myelin-stained section to show
directionality of the underlying fibers. The endfolial pathway was consistently
visualized within the hippocampal body in vivo in all subjects. It is a central
pathway in the hippocampus, with unknown relevance in neurodegenerative
disorders, but now that it can be visualized noninvasively, we can study its
function and alterations in neurodegeneration.

Memory tests able to differentiate encoding and retrieval processes from the
memoranda storing ones should be used to differentiate patients in a very early
phase of AD. In fact, individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) can be
characterized by two different memory profiles: a pure amnestic one (with poor
learning and retrieval and poor improvement when encoding is assisted and
retrieval is facilitated) and a dysexecutive one (with inefficient encoding
and/or poor retrieval strategies and improvement with assisted encoding and
retrieval). The amnestic profile characterizes subjects affected by
medio-temporal atrophy typical of AD. In this study, a Grober-Buschke memory
procedure was used to evaluate normal controls and MCI patients with different
cognitive profiles: pure amnestic (aMCIsd), amnestic plus other cognitive
impairments (aMCImd) and non-amnestic (naMCI). An index of sensitivity of cueing 
(ISC) measured the advantage passing from free to cued recall. Results showed
that both strategic and consolidation abilities were impaired in the aMCIsd and
aMCImd groups and were preserved in the naMCI group. aMCImd, however, compensated
the memory deficit with assisted encoding and retrieval, but aMCIsd performed
very poorly. When MCI subjects were defined according to the ISC value, subjects 
with poor ISC were primarily in the aMCIsd group and, to a lesser extent, in the 
aMCImd group and the naMCI group. Finally, patients with a poor ISC showed
cerebral atrophy documented in the precocious phase of AD and the retrosplenial
cerebral areas seemed to be the most useful areas for identifying patients in the
early phase of AD.

Concept formation is the ability to create an abstract link between dissimilar
objects or thoughts and is crucial for abstract and creative thinking. This
process is related to the integrity of the prefrontal cortex, given the altered
performances reported in patients with frontal damage, particularly those
suffering from the behavioural variant of frontotemporal dementia. However, the
cognitive mechanisms and neural bases of verbal concept formation are not clearly
understood. The present study was aimed at addressing the following unresolved
issues regarding concept formation in the field of neurology and cognitive
neuroscience: (i) Are alterations in concept formation specific to frontotemporal
dementia or are they also present in other cortical neurodegenerative disorders
such as Alzheimer's disease? (ii) Is impaired performance in concept formation
due to cortical lesions specific to frontotemporal dementia or to a
cortico-subcortical frontal syndrome? and (iii) What are the cognitive mechanisms
and neural bases underlying concept formation? To address these questions, we
designed the Verbal Concept Formation Task, an experimental paradigm based on the
similarities test. Patients presenting with severe frontal dysfunction
(frontotemporal dementia, n = 18, and the Richardson form of progressive
supranuclear palsy, n = 21) or with medial temporal pathology (amnestic mild
cognitive impairment or Alzheimer's disease, n = 14) and healthy participants (n 
= 18) were given the Verbal Concept Formation Task and a large battery of
neuropsychological tests. In addition, all participants underwent 3D T1-weighted 
MRI to analyse grey matter volume using voxel-based morphometry. Frontal patients
were significantly impaired on the Verbal Concept Formation Task as compared to
non-frontal participants (P = 0.00001). Global performance score was positively
correlated with scores in cognitive tasks assessing executive functions and with 
grey matter volume in several areas, mostly in the frontal-basal-ganglion
network. Two types of errors were observed in frontal patients. The most frequent
was discriminating instead of grouping items ('linking deficit'). Patients also
linked items on a concrete instead of an abstract basis ('abstraction deficit'). 
Linking and abstraction deficits were related to partially different areas: the
linking deficit to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, right middle frontal
gyrus and both inferior parietal lobules and the abstraction deficit to the head 
of the caudate nuclei and the left superior frontal gyrus. These data suggest
that verbal concept formation requires the integrity of the
prefrontal-basal-ganglion functional network. In addition, it can be divided into
two distinct cognitive processes, which are underlain by two partially different 
neural networks.

INTRODUCTION: Genome-wide association studies identify rs11136000 in the CLU
gene, which codes for Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin, as a significant risk variant
for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms by which this variant
confers susceptibility remain relatively unknown.
METHODS: Eighty-five healthy Caucasian participants underwent functional magnetic
resonance imaging during a working memory (WM) task and were genotyped for CLU
rs11136000/APOE loci.
RESULTS: Here we show that young individuals with the CLU rs11136000 risk variant
(C) have higher activation levels in memory-related prefrontal and limbic areas
during a WM task. We also found subtle reductions in gray matter in the right
hippocampal formation in carriers of the risk variant.
DISCUSSION: We suggest that this pattern of multimodal imaging results may
reflect incipient structural differences and inefficient functional activation.
This study supports accumulating evidence suggesting that genetic risk for AD
affects the neural networks associated with memory in healthy individuals.

Randomized denoising autoencoders for smaller and efficient imaging based AD
clinical trials.

Ithapul VK, Singh V, Okonkwo O, Johnson SC.

There is growing body of research devoted to designing imaging-based biomarkers
that identify Alzheimer's disease (AD) in its prodromal stage using statistical
machine learning methods. Recently several authors investigated how clinical
trials for AD can be made more efficient (i.e., smaller sample size) using
predictive measures from such classification methods. In this paper, we explain
why predictive measures given by such SVM type objectives may be less than ideal 
for use in the setting described above. We give a solution based on a novel deep 
learning model, randomized denoising autoencoders (rDA), which regresses on
training labels y while also accounting for the variance, a property which is
very useful for clinical trial design. Our results give strong improvements in
sample size estimates over strategies based on multi-kernel learning. Also, rDA
predictions appear to more accurately correlate to stages of disease. Separately,
our formulation empirically shows how deep architectures can be applied in the
large d, small n regime--the default situation in medical imaging. This result is
of independent interest.

INTRODUCTION: The long preclinical phase of Alzheimer's disease provides
opportunities for potential disease-modifying interventions in prodromal stages
such as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Anodal transcranial direct current
stimulation (anodal-tDCS), with its potential to enhance neuroplasticity, may
allow improving cognition in MCI.
METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, sham-controlled study, anodal-tDCS was
administered to the left inferior frontal cortex during task-related and
resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess its impact
on cognition and brain functions in MCI.
RESULTS: During sham stimulation, MCI patients produced fewer correct
semantic-word-retrieval responses than matched healthy controls, which was
associated with hyperactivity in bilateral prefrontal regions. Anodal-tDCS
significantly improved performance to the level of controls, reduced task-related
prefrontal hyperactivity and resulted in "normalization" of abnormal network
configuration during resting-state fMRI.
DISCUSSION: Anodal-tDCS exerts beneficial effects on cognition and brain
functions in MCI, thereby providing a framework to test whether repeated
stimulation sessions may yield sustained reversal of cognitive deficits.

Neuropathology suggests an important role for the locus coeruleus (LC) in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathophysiology. Neuropathology and structural damage in
the LC appears to be one of the earliest changes. We hypothesize that reduced
functional integration of the LC reflected by lower brain functional connectivity
contributes to early memory dysfunction. To test this, we examined resting-state 
functional connectivity from the LC in 18 healthy older individuals and 18 mildly
cognitively impaired patients with possible AD. Connectivity measures were
correlated with memory scores. The left LC showed strong connectivity to the left
parahippocampal gyrus that correlated with memory performance in healthy persons.
This connectivity was reduced in aMCI patients. Lateralization of
connectivity-memory correlations was altered in less impaired aMCI patients:
greater right LC-left parahippocampal gyrus connectivity was associated with
better memory performance, in particular for encoding. Our results provide new
evidence that the LC, in interaction with the parahippocampal gyrus, may
contribute to episodic memory formation. They suggest functional impairment and
the possibility that associated compensatory changes contribute to preserved

The capacity to remember self-referential past events relies on the integrity of 
a distributed neural network. Controversy exists, however, regarding the
involvement of specific brain structures for the retrieval of recently
experienced versus more distant events. Here, we explored how characteristic
patterns of atrophy in neurodegenerative disorders differentially disrupt remote 
versus recent autobiographical memory. Eleven behavioural-variant frontotemporal 
dementia, 10 semantic dementia, 15 Alzheimer's disease patients and 14 healthy
older Controls completed the Autobiographical Interview. All patient groups
displayed significant remote memory impairments relative to Controls. Similarly, 
recent period retrieval was significantly compromised in behavioural-variant
frontotemporal dementia and Alzheimer's disease, yet semantic dementia patients
scored in line with Controls. Voxel-based morphometry and diffusion tensor
imaging analyses, for all participants combined, were conducted to investigate
grey and white matter correlates of remote and recent autobiographical memory
retrieval. Neural correlates common to both recent and remote time periods were
identified, including the hippocampus, medial prefrontal, and frontopolar
cortices, and the forceps minor and left hippocampal portion of the cingulum
bundle. Regions exclusively implicated in each time period were also identified. 
The integrity of the anterior temporal cortices was related to the retrieval of
remote memories, whereas the posterior cingulate cortex emerged as a structure
significantly associated with recent autobiographical memory retrieval. This
study represents the first investigation of the grey and white matter correlates 
of remote and recent autobiographical memory retrieval in neurodegenerative
disorders. Our findings demonstrate the importance of core brain structures,
including the medial prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, irrespective of time
period, and point towards the contribution of discrete regions in mediating
successful retrieval of distant versus recently experienced events.

Associative memory is essential to everyday activities, such as the binding of
faces and corresponding names to form single bits of information. However, this
ability often becomes impaired with increasing age. The most important neural
substrate of associative memory is the hippocampus, a structure crucially
implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The main aim of this 
study was to compare neural correlates of associative memory in healthy aging and
mild cognitive impairment (MCI), an at-risk state for AD. We used fMRI to
investigate differences in brain activation and connectivity between young
controls (n = 20), elderly controls (n = 32) and MCI patients (n = 21) during
associative memory retrieval. We observed lower hippocampal activation in MCI
patients than control groups during a face-name recognition task, and the
magnitude of this decrement was correlated with lower associative memory
performance. Further, increased activation in precentral regions in all older
adults indicated a stronger involvement of the task positive network (TPN) with
age. Finally, functional connectivity analysis revealed a stronger link of
hippocampal and striatal components in older adults in comparison to young
controls, regardless of memory impairment. In elderly controls, this went
hand-in-hand with a stronger activation of striatal areas. Increased TPN
activation may be linked to greater reliance on cognitive control in both older
groups, while increased functional connectivity between the hippocampus and the
striatum may suggest dedifferentiation, especially in elderly controls.

There is growing evidence that the human brain is a large scale complex network. 
The structural network is reported to be disrupted in cognitively impaired
patients. However, there have been few studies evaluating the effects of amyloid 
and small vessel disease (SVD) markers, the common causes of cognitive
impairment, on structural networks. Thus, we evaluated the association between
amyloid and SVD burdens and structural networks using diffusion tensor imaging
(DTI). Furthermore, we determined if network parameters predict cognitive
impairments. Graph theoretical analysis was applied to DTI data from 232
cognitively impaired patients with varying degrees of amyloid and SVD burdens.
All patients underwent Pittsburgh compound-B (PiB) PET to detect amyloid burden, 
MRI to detect markers of SVD, including the volume of white matter
hyperintensities and the number of lacunes, and detailed neuropsychological
testing. The whole-brain network was assessed by network parameters of
integration (shortest path length, global efficiency) and segregation (clustering
coefficient, transitivity, modularity). PiB retention ratio was not associated
with any white matter network parameters. Greater white matter hyperintensity
volumes or lacunae numbers were significantly associated with decreased network
integration (increased shortest path length, decreased global efficiency) and
increased network segregation (increased clustering coefficient, increased
transitivity, increased modularity). Decreased network integration or increased
network segregation were associated with poor performances in attention,
language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal-executive functions. Our results
suggest that SVD alters white matter network integration and segregation, which
further predicts cognitive dysfunction.

Deep learning based imaging data completion for improved brain disease diagnosis.

Li R, Zhang W, Suk HI, Wang L, Li J, Shen D, Ji S.

Combining multi-modality brain data for disease diagnosis commonly leads to
improved performance. A challenge in using multimodality data is that the data
are commonly incomplete; namely, some modality might be missing for some
subjects. In this work, we proposed a deep learning based framework for
estimating multi-modality imaging data. Our method takes the form of
convolutional neural networks, where the input and output are two volumetric
modalities. The network contains a large number of trainable parameters that
capture the relationship between input and output modalities. When trained on
subjects with all modalities, the network can estimate the output modality given 
the input modality. We evaluated our method on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database, where the input and output modalities
are MRI and PET images, respectively. Results showed that our method
significantly outperformed prior methods.

Tests of generative semantic verbal fluency are widely used to study organization
and representation of concepts in the human brain. Previous studies demonstrated 
that clustering and switching behavior during verbal fluency tasks is supported
by multiple brain mechanisms associated with semantic memory and executive
control. Previous work relied on manual assessments of semantic relatedness
between words and grouping of words into semantic clusters. We investigated a
computational linguistic approach to measuring the strength of semantic
relatedness between words based on latent semantic analysis of word
co-occurrences in a subset of a large online encyclopedia. We computed semantic
clustering indices and compared them to brain network connectivity measures
obtained with task-free fMRI in a sample consisting of healthy participants and
those differentially affected by cognitive impairment. We found that semantic
clustering indices were associated with brain network connectivity in distinct
areas including fronto-temporal, fronto-parietal and fusiform gyrus regions. This
study shows that computerized semantic indices complement traditional assessments
of verbal fluency to provide a more complete account of the relationship between 
brain and verbal behavior involved organization and retrieval of lexical
information from memory.

We compare a variety of different anatomic connectivity measures, including
several novel ones, that may help in distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD)
patients from controls. We studied diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging 
from 200 subjects scanned as part of the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging
Initiative. We first evaluated measures derived from connectivity matrices based 
on whole-brain tractography; next, we studied additional network measures based
on a novel flow-based measure of brain connectivity, computed on a dense
3-dimensional lattice. Based on these 2 kinds of connectivity matrices, we
computed a variety of network measures. We evaluated the measures' ability to
discriminate disease with a repeated, stratified 10-fold cross-validated
classifier, using support vector machines, a supervised learning algorithm. We
tested the relative importance of different combinations of features based on the
accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and feature ranking of the classification of 
200 people into normal healthy controls and people with early or late mild
cognitive impairment or AD.

We introduce and describe the Reference Ability Neural Network Study and provide 
initial feasibility data. Based on analyses of large test batteries administered 
to individuals ranging from young to old, four latent variables, or reference
abilities (RAs) that capture the majority of the variance in age-related
cognitive change have been identified: episodic memory, fluid reasoning,
perceptual speed, and vocabulary. We aim to determine whether spatial fMRI
networks can be derived that are uniquely associated with the performance of each
reference ability. We plan to image 375 healthy adults (50 per decade from age 20
to 50; 75 per decade from age 50 to 80) while performing a set of 12 cognitive
tasks. Data on 174 participants are reported here. Three tasks were grouped a
priori into each of the four reference ability domains. We first assessed to what
extent both cognitive task scores and activation patterns readily show convergent
and discriminant validity, i.e. increased similarity between tasks within the
same domain and decreased similarity between tasks between domains, respectively.
Block-based time-series analysis of each individual task was conducted for each
participant via general linear modeling. We partialled activation common to all
tasks out of the imaging data. For both test scores and activation topographies, 
we then calculated correlations for each of 66 possible pairings of tasks, and
compared the magnitude of correlation of tasks within reference ability domains
to that of tasks between domains. For the behavioral data, globally there were
significantly stronger inter-task correlations within than between domains. When 
examining individual abilities, 3 of the domains also met these criteria but
memory reached only borderline significance. Overall there was greater
topographic similarity within reference abilities than between them (p<0.0001),
but when examined individually, statistical significance was reached only for
episodic memory and perceptual speed. We then turned to a multivariate technique,
linear indicator regression analysis, to derive four unique linear combinations
of Principal Components (PC) of imaging data that were associated with each RA.
We investigated the ability of the identified PCs to predict the reference domain
associated with the activation of individual subjects for individual tasks.
Median accuracy rates for associating component task activation with a particular
reference ability were quite good: memory: 82%; reasoning: 87%; speed: 84%;
vocabulary: 77%. These results demonstrate that even using basic GLM analysis,
the topography of activation of tasks within a domain is more similar than tasks 
between domains. The follow-up regression analyses suggest that all tasks with
each RA rely on a common network, unique to that RA. Our ultimate goal is to
better characterize these RA neural networks and then study how their expression 
changes across the age span. Our hope is that by focusing on these networks
associated with key features of cognitive aging, as opposed to task-related
activation associated with individual tasks, we will be able to advance our
knowledge regarding the key brain changes that underlie cognitive aging.

Functional neuroimaging studies report increased right prefrontal cortex (PFC)
involvement during verbal memory tasks amongst low-scoring older individuals,
compared to younger controls and their higher-scoring contemporaries. Some
propose that this reflects inefficient use of neural resources through failure of
the left PFC to inhibit non-task-related right PFC activity, via the anterior
corpus callosum (CC). For others, it indicates partial compensation - that is,
the right PFC cannot completely supplement the failing neural network, but
contributes positively to performance. We propose that combining structural and
diffusion brain MRI can be used to test predictions from these theories which
have arisen from fMRI studies. We test these hypotheses in immediate and delayed 
verbal memory ability amongst 90 healthy older adults of mean age 73 years. Right
hippocampus and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) volumes, and
fractional anisotropy (FA) in the splenium made unique contributions to verbal
memory ability in the whole group. There was no significant effect of anterior
callosal white matter integrity on performance. Rather, segmented linear
regression indicated that right DLPFC volume was a significantly stronger
positive predictor of verbal memory for lower-scorers than higher-scorers,
supporting a compensatory explanation for the differential involvement of the
right frontal lobe in verbal memory tasks in older age.

OBJECTIVE: Past studies have shown that measures of attentional control and
semantic memory are sensitive markers of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The effects of
established biomarkers of AD (cerebrospinal fluid tau and amyloid-beta42,
positron emission tomography Pittsburgh compound-B, and apolipoprotein E [APOE]
genotype) on concurrent cognitive performance in cognitively normal individuals
have been mixed. The present study examined the utility of combining attentional 
control with semantic retrieval as a sensitive correlate of AD biomarkers and
used mediation analyses to examine possible mechanisms by which the biomarkers
influence cognition.
METHOD: Three hundred sixty-three participants completed a category verification 
task (CVT), and 113 of them concurrently underwent biomarker assessments. On each
trial, participants viewed a category (e.g., "unit of time") and verified whether
a subsequent target item was an exemplar of the category ("hour") or not
("clock"). Importantly, the nonmembers of the category were associatively related
to the category (e.g., "clock" is not "a unit of time," but is highly related),
and demanded attentional control to reject.
RESULTS: Accuracy to the foil items was the strongest discriminator between
healthy aging and very mild symptomatic AD. Cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers had
independent yet synergistic influence on CVT performance in cognitively healthy
older adults. Furthermore, the influence of the biomarkers and APOE genotype was 
mediated primarily through increased levels of PIB.
CONCLUSION: The combined influence of attentional control with semantic retrieval
is a marker of symptomatic AD and a sensitive correlate of established biomarkers
for AD risk in cognitively healthy participants. The biomarkers influenced
cognition primarily through increased levels of amyloid in the brain.

PURPOSE: [(18)F]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging of the brain can be used to 
assist in the differential diagnosis of dementia. Group differences in glucose
uptake between patients with dementia and controls are well-known. However, a
multivariate analysis technique called scaled subprofile model, principal
component analysis (SSM/PCA) aiming at identifying diagnostic neural networks in 
diseases, have been applied less frequently. We validated an Alzheimer's
Disease-related (AD) glucose metabolic brain pattern using the SSM/PCA analysis
and applied it prospectively in an independent confirmation cohort.
METHODS: We used FDG-PET scans of 18 healthy controls and 15 AD patients
(identification cohort) to identify an AD-related glucose metabolic covariance
pattern. In the confirmation cohort (n=15), we investigated the ability to
discriminate between probable AD and non-probable AD (possible AD, mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) or subjective complaints).
RESULTS: The AD-related metabolic covariance pattern was characterized by
relatively decreased metabolism in the temporoparietal regions and relatively
increased metabolism in the subcortical white matter, cerebellum and sensorimotor
cortex. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves showed at a cut-off value 
of z=1.23, a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 94% for correct AD
classification. In the confirmation cohort, subjects with clinically probable AD 
diagnosis showed a high expression of the AD-related pattern whereas in subjects 
with a non-probable AD diagnosis a low expression was found.
CONCLUSION: The Alzheimer's disease-related cerebral glucose metabolic covariance
pattern identified by SSM/PCA analysis was highly sensitive and specific for
Alzheimer's disease. This method is expected to be helpful in the early diagnosis
of Alzheimer's disease in clinical practice.

Understanding neural network dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease is
imperative to effectively develop network-modulating therapies. In Alzheimer's
disease (AD), cognitive decline associates with deficits in resting-state
functional connectivity of diffuse brain networks. The goal of the current study 
was to test whether specific cognitive impairments in AD spectrum correlate with 
reduced functional connectivity of distinct brain regions. We recorded
resting-state functional connectivity of alpha-band activity in 27 patients with 
AD spectrum--22 patients with probable AD (5 logopenic variant primary
progressive aphasia, 7 posterior cortical atrophy, and 10 early-onset
amnestic/dysexecutive AD) and 5 patients with mild cognitive impairment due to
AD. We used magnetoencephalographic imaging (MEGI) to perform an unbiased search 
for regions where patterns of functional connectivity correlated with disease
severity and cognitive performance. Functional connectivity measured the strength
of coherence between a given region and the rest of the brain. Decreased neural
connectivity of multiple brain regions including the right posterior perisylvian 
region and left middle frontal cortex correlated with a higher degree of disease 
severity. Deficits in executive control and episodic memory correlated with
reduced functional connectivity of the left frontal cortex, whereas visuospatial 
impairments correlated with reduced functional connectivity of the left inferior 
parietal cortex. Our findings indicate that reductions in region-specific
alpha-band resting-state functional connectivity are strongly correlated with,
and might contribute to, specific cognitive deficits in AD spectrum. In the
future, MEGI functional connectivity could be an important biomarker to map and
follow defective networks in the early stages of AD.

This study investigated the impact of Alzheimer׳s disease (AD) on conjunctive and
relational binding in episodic memory. Mild AD patients and controls had to
remember item-color associations by imagining color either as a contextual
association (relational memory) or as a feature of the item to be encoded
(conjunctive memory). Patients׳ performance in each condition was correlated with
cerebral metabolism measured by FDG-PET. The results showed that AD patients had 
an impaired capacity to remember item-color associations, with deficits in both
relational and conjunctive memory. However, performance in the two kinds of
associative memory varied independently across patients. Partial Least Square
analyses revealed that poor conjunctive memory was related to hypometabolism in
an anterior temporal-posterior fusiform brain network, whereas relational memory 
correlated with metabolism in regions of the default mode network. These findings
support the hypothesis of distinct neural systems specialized in different types 
of associative memory and point to heterogeneous profiles of memory alteration in
Alzheimer׳s disease as a function of damage to the respective neural networks.

Clinical trials of the PET amyloid imaging agent (18)F-flutemetamol have used
visual assessment to classify PET scans as negative or positive for brain
amyloid. However, quantification provides additional information about regional
and global tracer uptake and may have utility for image assessment over time and 
across different centers. Using postmortem brain neuritic plaque density data as 
a truth standard to derive a standardized uptake value ratio (SUVR) threshold, we
assessed a fully automated quantification method comparing visual and
quantitative scan categorizations. We also compared the histopathology-derived
SUVR threshold with one derived from healthy controls.METHODS: Data from 345
consenting subjects enrolled in 8 prior clinical trials of (18)F-flutemetamol
injection were used. We grouped subjects into 3 cohorts: an autopsy cohort (n =
68) comprising terminally ill patients with postmortem confirmation of brain
amyloid status; a test cohort (n = 172) comprising 33 patients with clinically
probable Alzheimer disease, 80 patients with mild cognitive impairment, and 59
healthy volunteers; and a healthy cohort of 105 volunteers, used to define a
reference range for SUVR. Visual image categorizations for comparison were from a
previous study. A fully automated PET-only quantification method was used to
compute regional neocortical SUVRs that were combined into a single composite
SUVR. An SUVR threshold for classifying scans as positive or negative was derived
by ranking the PET scans from the autopsy cohort based on their composite SUVR
and comparing data with the standard of truth based on postmortem brain amyloid
status for subjects in the autopsy cohort. The derived threshold was used to
categorize the 172 scans in the test cohort as negative or positive, and results 
were compared with categorization using visual assessment. Different reference
and composite region definitions were assessed. Threshold levels were also
compared with corresponding thresholds derived from the healthy group.
RESULTS: Automated quantification (using pons as the reference region)
demonstrated 91% sensitivity and 88% specificity and gave 3 false-positive and 4 
false-negative scans. All 3 false-positive cases were either borderline-normal by
standard of truth or had moderate to heavy cortical diffuse plaque burden. In the
test cohort, the concordance between quantitative and visual read categorization 
ranged from 97.1% to 99.4% depending on the selection of reference and composite 
regions. The threshold derived from the healthy group was close to the
histopathology-derived threshold.
CONCLUSION: Categorization of (18)F-flutemetamol amyloid imaging data using an
automated PET-only quantification method showed good agreement with
histopathologic classification of neuritic plaque density and a strong
concordance with visual read results.

Historically, the human brain has been conceptually segregated from the periphery
and further dichotomized into gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) based on the
whitish appearance of the exceptionally high lipid content of the myelin sheaths 
encasing neuronal axons. These simplistic dichotomies were unfortunately extended
to conceptually segregate neurons from glia, cognition from behavior, and have
been codified in the separation of clinical and scientific fields into medicine, 
psychiatry, neurology, pathology, etc. The discrete classifications have helped
obscure the importance of continual dynamic communication between all brain cell 
types (neurons, astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, and precursor (NG2)
cells) as well as between brain and periphery through multiple signaling systems.
The signaling systems range from neurotransmitters to insulin, angiotensin, and
multiple kinases such a glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK-3) that together help
integrate metabolism, inflammation, and myelination processes and orchestrate the
development, plasticity, maintenance, and repair that continually optimize
function of neural networks. A more comprehensive, evolution-based, systems
biology approach that integrates brain, body, and environmental interactions may 
ultimately prove more fruitful in elucidating the complexities of human brain
function. The historic focus on neurons/GM is rebalanced herein by highlighting
the importance of a systems-level understanding of the interdependent age-related
shifts in both central and peripheral homeostatic mechanisms that can lead to
remarkably prevalent and devastating neuropsychiatric diseases. Herein we
highlight the role of glia, especially the most recently evolved oligodendrocytes
and the myelin they produce, in achieving and maintaining optimal brain function.
The human brain undergoes exceptionally protracted and pervasive myelination
(even throughout its GM) and can thus achieve and maintain the rapid conduction
and synchronous timing of neural networks on which optimal function depends. The 
continuum of increasing myelin vulnerability resulting from the human brain's
protracted myelination underlies underappreciated communalities between different
disease phenotypes ranging from developmental ones such as schizophrenia (SZ) and
bipolar disorder (BD) to degenerative ones such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).
These shared vulnerabilities also expose significant yet underexplored
opportunities for novel treatment and prevention approaches that have the
potential to considerably reduce the tremendous burden of neuropsychiatric
disease.

An optimal decisional space for the classification of Alzheimer's disease and
mild cognitive impairment.

Zhou Q, Goryawala M, Cabrerizo M, Wang J, Barker W, Loewenstein DA, Duara R,
Adjouadi M.

This paper proposes to combine MRI data with a neuropsychological test,
mini-mental state examination (MMSE), as input to a multi-dimensional space for
the classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and it's prodromal stages-mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) including amnestic MCI (aMCI) and nonamnestic MCI
(naMCI). The decisional space is constructed using those features deemed
statistically significant through an elaborate feature selection and ranking
mechanism. FreeSurfer was used to calculate 55 volumetric variables, which were
then adjusted for intracranial volume, age and education. The classification
results obtained using support vector machines are based on twofold cross
validation of 50 independent and randomized runs. The study included 59 AD, 67
aMCI, 56 naMCI, and 127 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. The study shows that
MMSE scores contain the most discriminative power of AD, aMCI, and naMCI. For AD 
versus CN, the two most discriminative volumetric variables (right hippocampus
and left inferior lateral ventricle), when combined with MMSE scores, provided an
average accuracy of 92.4% (sensitivity: 84.0%; specificity: 96.1%). MMSE scores
are found to improve all classifications with accuracy increments of 8.2% and 12%
for aMCI versus CN and naMCI versus CN, respectively. Results also show that
brain atrophy is almost evenly seen on both sides of the brain for AD subjects,
which is different from right-side dominance for aMCI and left-side dominance for
naMCI. Furthermore, hippocampal atrophy is seen to be the most significant for
aMCI, while Accumbens area and ventricle are most significant for naMCI.

For the last decade, it has been shown that neuroimaging can be a potential tool 
for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, Mild
Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and also fusion of different modalities can further
provide the complementary information to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Here, we
focus on the problems of both feature representation and fusion of multimodal
information from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission
Tomography (PET). To our best knowledge, the previous methods in the literature
mostly used hand-crafted features such as cortical thickness, gray matter
densities from MRI, or voxel intensities from PET, and then combined these
multimodal features by simply concatenating into a long vector or transforming
into a higher-dimensional kernel space. In this paper, we propose a novel method 
for a high-level latent and shared feature representation from neuroimaging
modalities via deep learning. Specifically, we use Deep Boltzmann Machine
(DBM)(2), a deep network with a restricted Boltzmann machine as a building block,
to find a latent hierarchical feature representation from a 3D patch, and then
devise a systematic method for a joint feature representation from the paired
patches of MRI and PET with a multimodal DBM. To validate the effectiveness of
the proposed method, we performed experiments on ADNI dataset and compared with
the state-of-the-art methods. In three binary classification problems of AD vs.
healthy Normal Control (NC), MCI vs. NC, and MCI converter vs. MCI non-converter,
we obtained the maximal accuracies of 95.35%, 85.67%, and 74.58%, respectively,
outperforming the competing methods. By visual inspection of the trained model,
we observed that the proposed method could hierarchically discover the complex
latent patterns inherent in both MRI and PET.

BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic autopsy studies show mixed Alzheimer's disease
(AD)/vascular pathology in many patients. Moreover, clinical research shows that 
it is not uncommon for AD and vascular dementia (VaD) patients to be equally
impaired on memory, executive, or other neurocognitive tests. However, this
clinical heterogeneity has not been incorporated into the new diagnostic criteria
for AD (Dubois et al., 2010; McKhann et al., 2011).
OBJECTIVE: The current research applied Latent Class Analysis (LCA) to a protocol
of six neuropsychological parameters to identify phenotypic subtypes from a large
group of AD/VaD participants. Follow-up analyses examined difference between
groups on neuroradiological parameters and neuropsychological measures of process
and errors.
METHODS: 223 AD/VaD patients were administered a comprehensive neuropsychological
protocol. Measures of whole brain and hippocampal volume were available for a
portion of the sample (n = 76).
RESULTS: LCA identified four distinct groups: moderate/mixed dementia (n = 54;
24.21%), mild/mixed dementia (n = 91; 40.80%); dysexecutive (n = 49, 21.97%), and
amnestic (n = 29, 13.00%). Follow-up analyses comparing the groups on
neuropsychological process and error scores showed that the dysexecutive group
exhibited difficulty sustaining mental set. The moderate/mixed group evidenced
pronounced impairment on tests of lexical retrieval/naming along with significant
amnesia. Amnestic patients also presented with gross amnesia, but showed relative
sparing on other neuropsychological measures. Mild/mixed patients exhibited
milder memory deficits that were intermediary between the amnestic and
moderate/mixed groups.
CONCLUSIONS: There are distinct neuropsychological profiles in patients
independent of clinical diagnosis, suggesting that the two are not wholly
separate and that this information should be integrated into new AD diagnostic
paradigms.

Early detection of dementia can be useful to delay progression of the disease and
to raise awareness of the condition. Alterations in temporal and spatial EEG
markers have been found in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild
cognitive impairment (MCI). Herein, we propose an automatic recognition method of
cognitive impairment evaluation based on EEG analysis using an artificial neural 
network (ANN) combined with a genetic algorithm (GA). The EEGs of 43 AD and MCI
patients (aged between 62 and 88 years) were recorded, analyzed and correlated
with their MMSE scores. Quantitative EEGs were calculated using discrete wavelet 
transform. The data obtained were analyzed by the means of the combined use of
ANN and GA to determine the degree of cognitive impairment. The good recognition 
rate of ANN fed with these inputs suggests that the combined GA/ANN approach may 
be useful for early detection of AD and could be a valuable tool to support
physicians in clinical practice.

Frontoparietal cognitive control of verbal memory recall in Alzheimer's disease.

Dhanjal NS(1), Wise RJ.

Author information:

Centre, Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom.

OBJECTIVE: Episodic memory retrieval is reliant upon cognitive control systems,
of which 2 have been identified with functional neuroimaging: a cingulo-opercular
salience network (SN) and a frontoparietal executive network (EN). In Alzheimer's
disease (AD), pathology is distributed throughout higher-order cortices. The
hypotheses were that this frontoparietal pathology would impair activity
associated with verbal memory recall; and that central cholinesterase inhibition 
(ChI) would modulate this, improving memory recall.
METHODS: Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to study normal
participants and 2 patient groups: mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD.
Activity within the EN and SN was observed during free recall of previously heard
sentences, and related to measures of recall accuracy.
RESULTS: In normal subjects, trials with reduced recall were associated with
greater activity in both the SN and EN. Better recall was associated with greater
activity in medial regions of the default mode network. By comparison, AD
patients showed attenuated responses in both the SN and EN compared with either
controls or MCI patients, even after recall performance was matched between
groups. Following ChI, AD patients showed no modulation of activity within the
SN, but increased activity within the EN. There was also enhanced activity within
regions associated with episodic and semantic memory during less successful
recall, requiring greater cognitive control.
INTERPRETATION: The results indicate that in AD, impaired responses of cognitive 
control networks during verbal memory recall are partly responsible for reduced
recall performance. One action of symptom-modifying treatment is partially to
reverse the abnormal function of frontoparietal cognitive control and temporal
lobe memory networks.

Developments in tasks and imaging techniques applied over the last decades have
yielded substantial support for the hypothesized role of the hippocampus in
mnemonic processes. Human imaging research has now moved on to disentangle the
contributions of the different hippocampal subregions and adjacent cortices, so
as to bridge the gap between rodent and human data. Besides the importance of
such studies for basic research, the investigation of hippocampal (dys)function
has clinical relevance for diseases ranging from neurological disorders such as
Alzheimer's disease or epilepsy to mental disorders such as schizophrenia or
anxiety disorders. So far, most of the present review articles and books about
the hippocampus and its functions focus on traditional declarative memory
paradigms and 'encoding versus retrieval'. In this chapter we concentrate on a
less travelled, but not less important, route concerning the role of the
hippocampus in a well-established associative learning (encoding) paradigm:
pavlovian fear conditioning. Fear conditioning is hypothesized to model aversive 
associative learning on a nonpathological level and is further assumed to recruit
the same networks that are relevant for anxiety disorders, with the hippocampus
being specific for contextual fear conditioning. We highlight the findings in
humans by addressing its role in mediating spatial and temporal aspects of a
context, involving different kinds of a fear-conditioning procedure (delay vs.
trace conditioning), and its role in extinction, both from a theoretical and
clinical perspective.

Behavioral evidence indicates that working memory (WM) in schizophrenia is
already impaired at the encoding stage. However, the neurophysiological basis of 
this primary deficit remains poorly understood. Using event-related fMRI, we
assessed differences in brain activation and functional connectivity during the
encoding, maintenance and retrieval stages of a visual WM task with 3 levels of
memory load in 17 adolescents with early-onset schizophrenia (EOS) and 17 matched
controls. The amount of information patients could store in WM was reduced at all
memory load levels. During encoding, activation in left ventrolateral prefrontal 
cortex (VLPFC) and extrastriate visual cortex, which in controls positively
correlated with the amount of stored information, was reduced in patients.
Additionally, patients showed disturbed functional connectivity between
prefrontal and visual areas. During retrieval, right inferior VLPFC
hyperactivation was correlated with hypoactivation of left VLPFC in patients
during encoding. Visual WM encoding is disturbed by a failure to adequately
engage a visual-prefrontal network critical for the transfer of perceptual
information into WM. Prefrontal hyperactivation appears to be a secondary
consequence of this primary deficit. Isolating the component processes of WM can 
lead to more specific neurophysiological markers for translational efforts
seeking to improve the treatment of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is believed to represent a transitional
stage between normal healthy ageing and the development of dementia. In
particular, aMCI patients have been shown to have higher annual transition rates 
to Alzheimer's Disease (AD) than individuals without cognitive impairment.
Despite intensifying interest investigating the neuroanatomical basis of this
transition, there remain a number of questions regarding the pathophysiological
process underlying aMCI itself. A number of recent studies in aMCI have shown
specific impairments in connectivity within the default mode network (DMN), which
is a group of regions strongly related to episodic memory capacities. However to 
date, no study has investigated the integrity of the DMN between patients with
aMCI and those with a non-amnestic pattern of MCI (naMCI), who have cognitive
impairment, but intact memory storage systems. In this study, we contrasted the
DMN connectivity in 24 aMCI and 33 naMCI patients using seed-based resting state 
fMRI. The two groups showed no statistical difference in their DMN
intra-connectivity. However when connectivity was analysed according to
performance on measures of episodic memory retrieval, the two groups were
separable, with aMCI patients demonstrating impaired functional connectivity
between the hippocampal formation and the posterior cingulate cortex. We provide 
evidence that this lack of connectivity is driven by impaired communication from 
the posterior cingulate hub and does not simply represent hippocampal atrophy,
suggesting that posterior cingulate degeneration is the driving force behind
impaired DMN connectivity in aMCI.

Episodic memory is typically affected during the course of Alzheimer's disease
(AD). Due to the pronounced heterogeneity of functional neuroimaging studies on
episodic memory impairments in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD regarding
their methodology and findings, we aimed to delineate consistent episodic
memory-related brain activation patterns. We performed a systematic,
quantitative, coordinate-based whole-brain activation likelihood estimation
meta-analysis of 28 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies
comprising 292 MCI and 102 AD patients contrasted to 409 age-matched control
subjects. We included episodic encoding and/or retrieval phases, investigated the
effects of group, verbal or image stimuli and correlated mean
Mini-Mental-Status-Examination (MMSE) scores with the modelled activation
estimates. MCI patients presented increased right hippocampal activation during
memory encoding, decreased activation in the left hippocampus and fusiform gyrus 
during retrieval tasks, as well as attenuated activation in the right anterior
insula/inferior frontal gyrus during verbal retrieval. In AD patients, however,
stronger activation within the precuneus during encoding tasks was accompanied by
attenuated right hippocampal activation during retrieval tasks. Low cognitive
performance (MMSE scores) was associated with stronger activation of the
precuneus and reduced activation of the right (para)hippocampus and anterior
insula/inferior frontal gyrus. This meta-analysis provides evidence for a
specific and probably disease stage-dependent brain activation pattern related to
the pathognomonic AD characteristic of episodic memory loss.

Random forests on Hadoop for genome-wide association studies of multivariate
neuroimaging phenotypes.

Wang Y, Goh W, Wong L, Montana G; Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative.

MOTIVATION: Multivariate quantitative traits arise naturally in recent
neuroimaging genetics studies, in which both structural and functional
variability of the human brain is measured non-invasively through techniques such
as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There is growing interest in detecting
genetic variants associated with such multivariate traits, especially in
genome-wide studies. Random forests (RFs) classifiers, which are ensembles of
decision trees, are amongst the best performing machine learning algorithms and
have been successfully employed for the prioritisation of genetic variants in
case-control studies. RFs can also be applied to produce gene rankings in
association studies with multivariate quantitative traits, and to estimate
genetic similarities measures that are predictive of the trait. However, in
studies involving hundreds of thousands of SNPs and high-dimensional traits, a
very large ensemble of trees must be inferred from the data in order to obtain
reliable rankings, which makes the application of these algorithms
computationally prohibitive.
RESULTS: We have developed a parallel version of the RF algorithm for regression 
and genetic similarity learning tasks in large-scale population genetic
association studies involving multivariate traits, called PaRFR (Parallel Random 
Forest Regression). Our implementation takes advantage of the MapReduce
programming model and is deployed on Hadoop, an open-source software framework
that supports data-intensive distributed applications. Notable speed-ups are
obtained by introducing a distance-based criterion for node splitting in the tree
estimation process. PaRFR has been applied to a genome-wide association study on 
Alzheimer's disease (AD) in which the quantitative trait consists of a
high-dimensional neuroimaging phenotype describing longitudinal changes in the
human brain structure. PaRFR provides a ranking of SNPs associated to this trait,
and produces pair-wise measures of genetic proximity that can be directly
compared to pair-wise measures of phenotypic proximity. Several known AD-related 
variants have been identified, including APOE4 and TOMM40. We also present
experimental evidence supporting the hypothesis of a linear relationship between 
the number of top-ranked mutated states, or frequent mutation patterns, and an
indicator of disease severity.

BACKGROUND: Autobiographical memory (ABM) refers to the recollection of
individual experiences, while personal semantic memory (PSM) refers to personally
relevant, but shared, facts. Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is routinely
diagnosed with the aid of neuropsychological tests, which do not tap the ABM and 
PSM domains.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to characterize the nature of ABM and PSM retrieval in
cognitively healthy (HC) memory complainers, non-memory complainers, and MCI
participants, and to investigate the relationship between neuropsychological
tests and personal memory.
METHODS: Gender- and education-matched participants (HC = 80 and MCI = 43)
completed the Episodic ABM Interview (EAMI) and a battery of neuropsychological
tests.
RESULTS: ABM and PSM did not differ between complainers and non-complainers, but 
were poorer in MCI participants, after accounting for age and depressive
symptomatology. There were significant associations between personal memory and
objective memory measures were found in MCI participants, but standard cognitive 
measures were more sensitive to MCI.
CONCLUSION: Personal memory was compromised in MCI, reflected by lower scores on 
the EAMI. Memory complaining, assessed by current approaches, did not have an
impact on personal memory. Standard subjective questionnaires might not reflect
the sorts of concerns that bring individuals to clinical attention. Understanding
personal memory function in the elderly may aid in the development of a more
sensitive measure of subjective memory concerns.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The progression pattern of brain structural changes in
patients with isolated cerebrovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. To
investigate the role of isolated CVD in cognitive impairment patients, patterns
of cortical thinning and hippocampal atrophy in pure subcortical vascular mild
cognitive impairment (svMCI) and pure subcortical vascular dementia (SVaD)
patients were characterized.
METHODS: Forty-five patients with svMCI and 46 patients with SVaD who were
negative on Pittsburgh compound B (PiB) positron emission tomography imaging and 
75 individuals with normal cognition (NC) were recruited.
RESULTS: Compared with NC, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited frontal, language
and retrieval type memory dysfunctions, which in patients with PiB(-) SVaD were
further impaired and accompanied by visuospatial and recognition memory
dysfunctions. Compared with NC, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited cortical
thinning in the frontal, perisylvian, basal temporal and posterior cingulate
regions. This atrophy was more prominent and extended further toward the lateral 
parietal and medial temporal regions in patients with PiB(-) SVaD. Compared with 
NC subjects, patients with PiB(-) svMCI exhibited hippocampal shape deformities
in the lateral body, whilst patients with PiB(-) SVaD exhibited additional
deformities within the lateral head and inferior body.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that patients with CVD in the absence of
Alzheimer's disease pathology can be demented, showing cognitive impairment in
multiple domains, which is consistent with the topography of cortical thinning
and hippocampal shape deformity.

In recent years, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) has attracted significant
attention as an indicator of high risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), and the
diagnosis of MCI can alert patient to carry out appropriate strategies to prevent
AD. To avoid subjectivity in diagnosis, we propose an ontology driven decision
support method which is an automated procedure for diagnosing MCI through
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In this approach, we encode specialized MRI
knowledge into an ontology and construct a rule set using machine learning
algorithms. Then we apply these two parts in conjunction with reasoning engine to
automatically distinguish MCI patients from normal controls (NC). The rule set is
trained by MRI data of 187 MCI patients and 177 normal controls selected from
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) using C4.5 algorithm. By using
a 10-fold cross validation, we prove that the performance of C4.5 with 80.2%
sensitivity is better than other algorithms, such as support vector machine
(SVM), Bayesian network (BN) and back propagation (BP) neural networks, and C4.5 
is suitable for the construction of reasoning rules. Meanwhile, the evaluation
results suggest that our approach would be useful to assist physicians
efficiently in real clinical diagnosis for the disease of MCI.

We hypothesized that semantic memory for object concepts involves both
representations of visual feature knowledge in modality-specific association
cortex and heteromodal regions that are important for integrating and organizing 
this semantic knowledge so that it can be used in a flexible, contextually
appropriate manner. We examined this hypothesis in an fMRI study of mild
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Participants were presented with pairs of printed words
and asked whether the words matched on a given visual-perceptual feature (e.g.,
guitar, violin: SHAPE). The stimuli probed natural kinds and manufactured
objects, and the judgments involved shape or color. We found activation of
bilateral ventral temporal cortex and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during 
semantic judgments, with AD patients showing less activation of these regions
than healthy seniors. Moreover, AD patients showed less ventral temporal
activation than did healthy seniors for manufactured objects, but not for natural
kinds. We also used diffusion-weighted MRI of white matter to examine fractional 
anisotropy (FA). Patients with AD showed significantly reduced FA in the superior
longitudinal fasciculus and inferior frontal-occipital fasciculus, which carry
projections linking temporal and frontal regions of this semantic network. Our
results are consistent with the hypothesis that semantic memory is supported in
part by a large-scale neural network involving modality-specific association
cortex, heteromodal association cortex, and projections between these regions.
The semantic deficit in AD thus arises from gray matter disease that affects the 
representation of feature knowledge and processing its content, as well as white 
matter disease that interrupts the integrated functioning of this large-scale
network.

Recently, there have been great interests for computer-aided diagnosis of
Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage, mild cognitive impairment
(MCI). Unlike the previous methods that considered simple low-level features such
as gray matter tissue volumes from MRI, and mean signal intensities from PET, in 
this paper, we propose a deep learning-based latent feature representation with a
stacked auto-encoder (SAE). We believe that there exist latent non-linear
complicated patterns inherent in the low-level features such as relations among
features. Combining the latent information with the original features helps build
a robust model in AD/MCI classification, with high diagnostic accuracy.
Furthermore, thanks to the unsupervised characteristic of the pre-training in
deep learning, we can benefit from the target-unrelated samples to initialize
parameters of SAE, thus finding optimal parameters in fine-tuning with the
target-related samples, and further enhancing the classification performances
across four binary classification problems: AD vs. healthy normal control (HC),
MCI vs. HC, AD vs. MCI, and MCI converter (MCI-C) vs. MCI non-converter (MCI-NC).
In our experiments on ADNI dataset, we validated the effectiveness of the
proposed method, showing the accuracies of 98.8, 90.7, 83.7, and 83.3 % for
AD/HC, MCI/HC, AD/MCI, and MCI-C/MCI-NC classification, respectively. We believe 
that deep learning can shed new light on the neuroimaging data analysis, and our 
work presented the applicability of this method to brain disease diagnosis.

The apolipoprotein E ε4 allele is a well established genetic risk factor for
sporadic Alzheimer's disease. It is associated with structural and functional
brain changes in healthy young, middle-aged and elderly subjects. In the current 
study, we assessed the impact of the ApoE genotype on brain macro- and
microstructure, cognitive functioning and brain activity in fifty healthy young
subjects (25 ApoE ε4 (ε4+) carriers and 25 non-carriers (ε4-), mean age
26.4±4.6years). We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and voxel based
morphometry (VBM) to assess brain structure, an extensive neuropsychological
battery to test cognitive functioning and event-related functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) to capture brain activity during episodic memory
encoding and retrieval. ApoE ε4 carriers differed from non-carriers in fMRI
activations but not in cognitive performance nor in brain micro- and
macrostructure. These results suggest functional alterations in the episodic
memory network that are modulated by the ε4 allele and might precede clinical or 
structural neurodegeneration.

We evaluated the brain metabolic correlates of main indexes of a widely used word
list learning test, the Rey Auditory Verbal Memory Test (RAVLT), in a group of
elderly subjects with memory complaints. Fifty-four subjects (age: 72.02 ± 7.45; 
Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score: 28.9 ± 1.24) presenting at a memory
clinic complaining of memory deficit, but not demented, and thirty controls (age:
71.87 ± 7.08; MMSE score: 29.1 ± 1.1) were included. Subjects with memory
complaints included both patients with (amnestic mild cognitive impairment, aMCI)
and without (subjective memory complaints, SMC) impairment on memory tests. All
subjects underwent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET),
analyzed with statistical parametric. Patients with aMCI but not those with SMC
showed the expected posterior cingulate-precuneus and parietal hypometabolism as 
compared to controls. Correlation was determined for between four indexes of the 
RAVLT and brain metabolism. The results show a significant correlation between
the delayed recall score and metabolism in posterior cingulate gyrus of both
hemispheres and in left precuneus, as well as between a score of long-term
percent retention and metabolism in left posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus,
and orbitofrontal areas. These correlations survived correction for age,
education, and MMSE score. No correlation was found between immediate or total
recall scores and glucose metabolism. These data show the relevant role of
posterior cingulate-precuneus and orbitofrontal cortices in retention and
retrieval of de-contextualized verbal memory material in a group of elderly
subjects with memory complaints and shed light on the topography of synaptic
dysfunction in these subjects, overlapping that found in the earliest stages of
Alzheimer-type neurodegeneration.

At a similar stage, patients with early onset Alzheimer's disease (EOAD) have
greater neocortical but less medial temporal lobe dysfunction and atrophy than
the late-onset form of the disease (LOAD). Whether the organization of neural
networks also differs has never been investigated. This study aims at
characterizing basal functional connectivity (FC) patterns of EOAD and LOAD in
two groups of 14 patients matched for disease duration and severity, relative to 
age-matched controls. All subjects underwent an extensive neuropsychological
assessment. Magnetic resonance imaging was used to quantify atrophy and
resting-state FC focusing on : the default mode network (DMN), found impaired in 
earlier studies on AD, and the anterior temporal network (ATN) and dorso-lateral 
prefrontal network (DLPFN), respectively involved in declarative memory and
executive functions. Patterns of atrophy and cognitive impairment in EOAD and
LOAD were in accordance with previous reports. FC within the DMN was similarly
decreased in both EOAD and LOAD relative to controls. However, a
double-dissociated pattern of FC changes in ATN and DLPFN was found. EOAD
exhibited decreased FC in the DLPFN and increased FC in the ATN relative to
controls, while the reverse pattern was found in LOAD. In addition, ATN and DLPFN
connectivity correlated respectively with memory and executive performances,
suggesting that increased FC is here likely to reflect compensatory mechanisms.
Thus, large-scale neural network changes in EOAD and LOAD endorse both common
features and differences, probably related to a distinct distribution of
pathological changes.

Neuroimaging research has substantiated the functional and structural
abnormalities underlying psychiatric disorders but has, thus far, failed to have 
a significant impact on clinical practice. Recently, neuroimaging-based diagnoses
and clinical predictions derived from machine learning analysis have shown
significant potential for clinical translation. This review introduces the key
concepts of this approach, including how the multivariate integration of patterns
of brain abnormalities is a crucial component. We survey recent findings that
have potential application for diagnosis, in particular early and differential
diagnoses in Alzheimer disease and schizophrenia, and the prediction of clinical 
response to treatment in depression. We discuss the specific clinical
opportunities and the challenges for developing biomarkers for psychiatry in the 
absence of a diagnostic gold standard. We propose that longitudinal outcomes,
such as early diagnosis and prediction of treatment response, offer definite
opportunities for progress. We propose that efforts should be directed toward
clinically challenging predictions in which neuroimaging may have added value,
compared with the existing standard assessment. We conclude that diagnostic and
prognostic biomarkers will be developed through the joint application of expert
psychiatric knowledge in addition to advanced methods of analysis.

In human cognition, self and memory processes strongly interact, as evidenced by 
the memory advantage for self-referential materials [Self-Reference Effect (SRE) 
and Self-Reference Recollection Effect (SRRE)]. The current study examined this
interaction at the behavioural level and its neural correlates in patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Healthy older controls (HC) and AD patients performed
trait-adjectives judgements either for self-relevance or for other-relevance
(encoding phase). In a first experiment, the encoding and subsequent yes-no
recognition phases were administrated in a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
scanner. Brain activation as measured by functional MRI (fMRI) was examined
during self-relevance judgements and anatomical images were used to search for
correlation between the memory advantage for self-related items and grey matter
density (GMD). In a second experiment, participants described the retrieval
experience that had driven their recognition decisions (familiarity vs
recollective experience). The behavioural results revealed that the SRE and SRRE 
were impaired in AD patients compared to HC participants. Furthermore, verbal
reports revealed that the retrieval of self-related information was
preferentially associated with the retrieval of contextual details, such as
source memory in the HC participants, but less so in the AD patients. Our imaging
findings revealed that both groups activated the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) 
at encoding during self-relevance judgements. However, the variable and limited
memory advantage for self-related information was associated with GMD in the
lateral prefrontal cortex in the AD patients, a region supporting high-order
processes linking self and memory. These findings suggest that even if AD
patients engage MPFC during self-referential judgements, the retrieval of
self-related memories is qualitatively and quantitatively impaired in relation
with altered high-order processes in the lateral PFC.

impairment using both cognitive and neuroimaging predictors.

The objective of this work was to assess the predictive accuracy of targeted
neuroimaging and neuropsychological measures for the detection of incipient
dementia in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and to examine the 
potential benefit of combining both classes of measures. Baseline MRI measures
included hippocampal volume, cortical thickness, and white matter
hyperintensities. Neuropsychological assessment focused on different aspects of
episodic memory (i.e., familiarity, free recall, and associative memory) and
executive control functions (i.e., working memory, switching, and planning).
Global and regional cortical thinning was observed in MCI patients who progressed
to dementia compared to those who remained stable, whereas no differences were
found between groups for baseline hippocampal volume and white matter
hyperintensities. The strongest neuroimaging predictors were baseline cortical
thickness in the right anterior cingulate and middle frontal gyri. For cognitive 
predictors, we found that deficits in both free recall and recognition episodic
memory tasks were highly suggestive of progression to dementia. Cortical thinning
in the right anterior cingulate gyrus, combined to controlled and
familiarity-based retrieval deficits, achieved a classification accuracy of
87.5%, a specificity of 90.9%, and a sensitivity of 83.3%. This predictive model 
including both classes of measures provided more accurate predictions than those 
based on neuroimaging or cognitive measures alone. Overall, our findings suggest 
that detecting preclinical Alzheimer's disease is probably best accomplished by
combining complementary information from targeted neuroimaging and cognitive
classifiers, and highlight the importance of taking into account both structural 
and functional changes associated with the disease.

OBJECTIVES: This study examines the anatomical correlates of naming vs
recognizing faces using a novel measure that utilizes culturally relevant and
age-appropriate items, the Northwestern University Famous Faces (NUFFACE) Test,
in primary progressive aphasia (PPA), a syndrome characterized by progressive
language deficits and associated with cortical atrophy in areas important for
word and object representations.
METHODS: NUFFACE Test performance of 27 controls (mean age 62.3 years) was
compared with that of 30 patients with PPA (mean age 62 years). Associations
between NUFFACE Test performance and cortical thickness measures were quantified 
within the PPA group.
RESULTS: Patients with PPA displayed significant impairment on the NUFFACE Test, 
demonstrating that it is a useful measure of famous-face identification for
individuals with relatively young-onset dementias. Despite widespread
distribution of atrophy in the PPA group, face naming impairments were correlated
with atrophy of the left anterior temporal lobe while face recognition
impairments were correlated with bitemporal atrophy.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to their clinical relevance for highlighting the
distinction between face naming and recognition impairments in individuals with
young-onset dementia, these findings add new insights into the dissociable
clinico-anatomical substrates of lexical retrieval and object knowledge.

Resting state functional connectivity (rs-fc) using fMRI has become an important 
tool in examining differences in brain activity between patient and healthy
populations. Studies employing rs-fc have successfully identified altered
intrinsic neural networks in many neurological and psychiatric disorders,
including Alzheimer's disease, schizophrenia, and more recently, tinnitus. The
neural mechanisms of subjective tinnitus, defined as the perception of sound
without an external source, are not well understood. Several inherent networks
have been implicated in tinnitus; these include default mode, auditory, dorsal
attention, and visual resting-state networks. Evidence from several studies has
begun to suggest that tinnitus causes consistent modifications to these networks,
including greater connectivity between limbic areas and cortical networks not
traditionally involved with emotion processing, and increased connectivity
between attention and auditory processing brain regions. Such consistent changes 
to these networks may allow for the identification of objective brain imaging
measures of tinnitus, leading to a better understanding of the neural basis of
the disorder. Further, examination of rs-fc allows us to correlate behavioral
measures, such as tinnitus severity and comorbid factors including hearing loss, 
with specific intrinsic networks. This article is part of a Special Issue
entitled Human Auditory Neuroimaging.

Identification and mapping of linear antibody epitopes in human serum albumin
using high-density Peptide arrays.

We have recently developed a high-density photolithographic, peptide array
technology with a theoretical upper limit of 2 million different peptides per
array of 2 cm(2). Here, we have used this to perform complete and exhaustive
analyses of linear B cell epitopes of a medium sized protein target using human
serum albumin (HSA) as an example. All possible overlapping 15-mers from HSA were
synthesized and probed with a commercially available polyclonal rabbit anti-HSA
antibody preparation. To allow for identification of even the weakest epitopes
and at the same time perform a detailed characterization of key residues involved
in antibody binding, the array also included complete single substitution scans
(i.e. including each of the 20 common amino acids) at each position of each
15-mer peptide. As specificity controls, all possible 15-mer peptides from bovine
serum albumin (BSA) and from rabbit serum albumin (RSA) were included as well.
The resulting layout contained more than 200.000 peptide fields and could be
synthesized in a single array on a microscope slide. More than 20 linear epitope 
candidates were identified and characterized at high resolution i.e. identifying 
which amino acids in which positions were needed, or not needed, for antibody
interaction. As expected, moderate cross-reaction with some peptides in BSA was
identified whereas no cross-reaction was observed with peptides from RSA. We
conclude that high-density peptide microarrays are a very powerful methodology to
identify and characterize linear antibody epitopes, and should advance detailed
description of individual specificities at the single antibody level as well as
serologic analysis at the proteome-wide level.

Glucose metabolism during resting state reveals abnormal brain networks
organization in the Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment.

This paper aims to study the abnormal patterns of brain glucose metabolism
co-variations in Alzheimer disease (AD) and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
patients compared to Normal healthy controls (NC) using the Alzheimer Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. The local cerebral metabolic rate for
glucose (CMRgl) in a set of 90 structures belonging to the AAL atlas was obtained
from Fluro-Deoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography data in resting state. It is
assumed that brain regions whose CMRgl values are significantly correlated are
functionally associated; therefore, when metabolism is altered in a single
region, the alteration will affect the metabolism of other brain areas with which
it interrelates. The glucose metabolism network (represented by the matrix of the
CMRgl co-variations among all pairs of structures) was studied using the graph
theory framework. The highest concurrent fluctuations in CMRgl were basically
identified between homologous cortical regions in all groups. Significant
differences in CMRgl co-variations in AD and MCI groups as compared to NC were
found. The AD and MCI patients showed aberrant patterns in comparison to NC
subjects, as detected by global and local network properties (global and local
efficiency, clustering index, and others). MCI network's attributes showed an
intermediate position between NC and AD, corroborating it as a transitional stage
from normal aging to Alzheimer disease. Our study is an attempt at exploring the 
complex association between glucose metabolism, CMRgl covariations and the
attributes of the brain network organization in AD and MCI.

Neurons are anatomically and physiologically connected to each other, and these
connections are involved in various neuronal functions. Multiple important neural
networks involved in neurodegenerative diseases can be detected using network
analyses in functional neuroimaging. First, the basic methods and theories of
voxel-based network analyses, such as principal component analysis, independent
component analysis, and seed-based analysis, are described. Disease- and
symptom-specific brain networks have been identified using glucose metabolism
images in patients with Parkinson's disease. These networks enable us to
objectively evaluate individual patients and serve as diagnostic tools as well as
biomarkers for therapeutic interventions. Many functional MRI studies have shown 
that "hub" brain regions, such as the posterior cingulate cortex and medial
prefrontal cortex, are deactivated by externally driven cognitive tasks; such
brain regions form the "default mode network." Recent studies have shown that
this default mode network is disrupted from the preclinical phase of Alzheimer's 
disease and is associated with amyloid deposition in the brain. Some recent
studies have shown that the default mode network is also impaired in Parkinson's 
disease, whereas other studies have shown inconsistent results. These incongruent
results could be due to the heterogeneous pharmacological status, differences in 
mesocortical dopaminergic impairment status, and concomitant amyloid deposition. 
Future neuroimaging network analysis studies will reveal novel and interesting
findings that will uncover the pathomechanisms of neurological and psychiatric
disorders.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 5.4 million Americans. Evidence suggests that
individuals who are positive for the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) ε4 allele are at
higher risk for developing the disease. Studies have also shown that the ε4
allele is linked to olfactory decline. Olfactory functioning may be investigated 
using olfactory event-related potentials (OERPs). The high temporal resolution of
OERPs enables an understanding of the neural correlates of olfactory processing
and functioning. This study investigated the effects of age, ApoE ε4 status,
response type, and electrode site on OERP latency and amplitude during encoding
and retrieval in an odor recognition memory task. The 60 participants were
equally divided into 3 age groups matched on ε4 status: younger, middle, and
older. Odors were presented using a computer-controlled olfactometer.
Participants were notified during encoding that this was a task of odor memory.
Results indicated differences in OERP activity as a function of age, ApoE ε4
status, response type, and electrode site. These findings highlight the potential
of OERPs to distinguish ε4- and ε4+ individuals and to contribute to an earlier
diagnosis of AD.

Emotional changes are common in mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's
disease (AD). Intrinsic connectivity imaging studies suggest that default mode
network degradation in AD is accompanied by the release of an emotion-relevant
salience network. We investigated whether emotional contagion, an evolutionarily 
conserved affect-sharing mechanism, is higher in MCI and AD secondary to
biological alterations in neural networks that support emotion. We measured
emotional contagion in 237 participants (111 healthy controls, 62 patients with
MCI, and 64 patients with AD) with the Interpersonal Reactivity Index Personal
Distress subscale. Depressive symptoms were evaluated with the Geriatric
Depression Scale. Participants underwent structural MRI, and voxel-based
morphometry was used to relate whole-brain maps to emotional contagion. Analyses 
of covariance found significantly higher emotional contagion at each stage of
disease progression [controls < MCI (P < 0.01) and MCI < AD (P < 0.001)].
Depressive symptoms were also higher in patients compared with controls [controls
< MCI (P < 0.01) and controls < AD (P < 0.0001)]. Higher emotional contagion (but
not depressive symptoms) was associated with smaller volume in right inferior,
middle, and superior temporal gyri (PFWE < 0.05); right temporal pole, anterior
hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus; and left middle temporal gyrus (all P <
0.001, uncorrected). These findings suggest that in MCI and AD, neurodegeneration
of temporal lobe structures important for affective signal detection and emotion 
inhibition are associated with up-regulation of emotion-generating mechanisms.
Emotional contagion, a quantifiable index of empathic reactivity that is present 
in other species, may be a useful tool with which to study emotional alterations 
in animal models of AD.

Conflicting evidence exists regarding the integrity of episodic memory in the
behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). Recent converging evidence
suggests that episodic memory in progressive cases of bvFTD is compromised to the
same extent as in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The underlying neural substrates of
these episodic memory deficits, however, likely differ contingent on dementia
type. In this study we sought to elucidate the neural substrates of episodic
memory performance, across recall and recognition tasks, in both patient groups
using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analyses. We predicted that episodic memory
dysfunction would be apparent in both patient groups but would relate to
divergent patterns of neural atrophy specific to each dementia type. We assessed 
episodic memory, across verbal and visual domains, in 19 bvFTD, 18 AD patients,
and 19 age- and education-matched controls. Behaviorally, patient groups were
indistinguishable for immediate and delayed recall, across verbal and visual
domains. Whole-brain VBM analyses revealed regions commonly implicated in
episodic retrieval across groups, namely the right temporal pole, right frontal
lobe, left paracingulate gyrus, and right anterior hippocampus. Divergent neural 
networks specific to each group were also identified. Whereas a widespread
network including posterior regions such as the posterior cingulate cortex,
parietal and occipital cortices was exclusively implicated in AD, the frontal and
anterior temporal lobes underpinned the episodic memory deficits in bvFTD. Our
results point to distinct neural changes underlying episodic memory decline
specific to each dementia syndrome.

Deficits in memory for everyday activities are common complaints among healthy
and demented older adults. The medial temporal lobes and dorsolateral prefrontal 
cortex are both affected by aging and early-stage Alzheimer's disease, and are
known to influence performance on laboratory memory tasks. We investigated
whether the volume of these structures predicts everyday memory. Cognitively
healthy older adults and older adults with mild Alzheimer's-type dementia watched
movies of everyday activities and completed memory tests on the activities.
Structural MRI was used to measure brain volume. Medial temporal but not
prefrontal volume strongly predicted subsequent memory. Everyday memory depends
on segmenting activity into discrete events during perception, and medial
temporal volume partially accounted for the relationship between performance on
the memory tests and performance on an event-segmentation task. The
everyday-memory measures used in this study involve retrieval of episodic and
semantic information as well as working memory updating. Thus, the current
findings suggest that during perception, the medial temporal lobes support the
construction of event representations that determine subsequent memory.

This project aimed to investigate the metabolic basis for resilience to
neurodegeneration (cognitive reserve) in highly educated patients with prodromal 
Alzheimer disease (AD).METHODS: Sixty-four patients with amnestic mild cognitive 
impairment who later converted to AD dementia during follow-up, and 90 controls, 
underwent brain (18)F-FDG PET. Both groups were divided into a poorly educated
subgroup (42 controls and 36 prodromal AD patients) and a highly educated
subgroup (48 controls and 28 prodromal AD patients). Brain metabolism was first
compared between education-matched groups of patients and controls. Then,
metabolism was compared between highly and poorly educated prodromal AD patients 
in both directions to identify regions of high education-related metabolic
depression and compensation. The clusters of significant depression and
compensation were further used as volumetric regions of interest (ROIs) in a
brain interregional correlation analysis in each prodromal AD subgroup to explore
metabolic connectivity. All analyses were performed by means of SPM8 (P < 0.001
uncorrected at peak level, P < 0.05 false discovery rate-corrected at cluster
level; age, sex, Mini-Mental State Examination score, and center as nuisance).
RESULTS: Highly educated prodromal AD patients showed more severe hypometabolism 
than poorly educated prodromal AD patients in the left inferior and middle
temporal gyri and the left middle occipital gyrus (ROI depression). Conversely,
they showed relative hypermetabolism in the right inferior, middle, and superior 
frontal gyri (ROI compensation). The sites of compensation, mainly corresponding 
to the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFC), showed wide metabolic
correlations with several cortical areas in both hemispheres (frontotemporal
cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, and precuneus) in highly educated prodromal AD
patients but not in poorly educated prodromal AD patients. To provide evidence on
whether these metabolic correlations represent preservation of the physiologic
networks of highly educated control subjects (neural reserve) or rather the
recruitment of alternative networks (neural compensation), or a combination of
the two, we performed metabolic connectivity analysis of the DLFC in highly
educated controls as well. The correlation sites of right DLFC partly overlapped 
those of highly educated prodromal AD patients but were less extended.
CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that highly educated prodromal AD
patients can cope better with the disease thanks to neural reserve but also to
the recruitment of compensatory neural networks in which the right DLFC plays a
key role.

Automated structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) processing pipelines and
different multivariate techniques are gaining popularity for Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) research. We used four supervised learning methods to classify AD patients
and controls (CTL) and to prospectively predict the conversion of mild cognitive 
impairment (MCI) to AD from baseline MRI data. A total of 345 participants from
the AddNeuroMed cohort were included in this study; 116 AD patients, 119 MCI
patients and 110 CTL individuals. High resolution sagittal 3D MP-RAGE datasets
were acquired and MRI data were processed using FreeSurfer. We explored the
classification ability of orthogonal projections to latent structures (OPLS),
decision trees (Trees), artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector
machines (SVM). Applying 10-fold cross-validation demonstrated that SVM and OPLS 
were slightly superior to Trees and ANN, although not statistically significant
for distinguishing between AD and CTL. The classification experiments resulted in
up to 83% sensitivity and 87% specificity for the best techniques. For the
prediction of conversion of MCI patients at baseline to AD at 1-year follow-up,
we obtained an accuracy of up to 86%. The value of the multivariate models
derived from the classification of AD vs. CTL was shown to be robust and
efficient in the identification of MCI converters.

Amyloid imaging studies of presymptomatic familial Alzheimer's disease have
revealed the striatum and thalamus to be the earliest sites of amyloid
deposition. This study aimed to investigate whether there are associated volume
and diffusivity changes in these subcortical structures during the presymptomatic
and symptomatic stages of familial Alzheimer's disease. As the thalamus and
striatum are involved in neural networks subserving complex cognitive and
behavioural functions, we also examined the diffusion characteristics in
connecting white matter tracts. A cohort of 20 presenilin 1 mutation carriers
underwent volumetric and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging,
neuropsychological and clinical assessments; 10 were symptomatic, 10 were
presymptomatic and on average 5.6 years younger than their expected age at onset;
20 healthy control subjects were also studied. We conducted region of interest
analyses of volume and diffusivity changes in the thalamus, caudate, putamen and 
hippocampus and examined diffusion behaviour in the white matter tracts of
interest (fornix, cingulum and corpus callosum). Voxel-based morphometry and
tract-based spatial statistics were also used to provide unbiased whole-brain
analyses of group differences in volume and diffusion indices, respectively. We
found that reduced volumes of the left thalamus and bilateral caudate were
evident at a presymptomatic stage, together with increased fractional anisotropy 
of bilateral thalamus and left caudate. Although no significant hippocampal
volume loss was evident presymptomatically, reduced mean diffusivity was observed
in the right hippocampus and reduced mean and axial diffusivity in the right
cingulum. In contrast, symptomatic mutation carriers showed increased mean, axial
and in particular radial diffusivity, with reduced fractional anisotropy, in all 
of the white matter tracts of interest. The symptomatic group also showed atrophy
and increased mean diffusivity in all of the subcortical grey matter regions of
interest, with increased fractional anisotropy in bilateral putamen. We propose
that axonal injury may be an early event in presymptomatic Alzheimer's disease,
causing an initial fall in axial and mean diffusivity, which then increases with 
loss of axonal density. The selective degeneration of long-coursing white matter 
tracts, with relative preservation of short interneurons, may account for the
increase in fractional anisotropy that is seen in the thalamus and caudate
presymptomatically. It may be owing to their dense connectivity that imaging
changes are seen first in the thalamus and striatum, which then progress to
involve other regions in a vulnerable neuronal network.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroimaging and lesion studies indicate a left hemisphere network 
for verb and verb argument structure processing, involving both frontal and
temporoparietal brain regions. Although their verb comprehension is generally
unimpaired, it is well known that individuals with agrammatic aphasia often
present with verb production deficits, characterized by an argument structure
complexity hierarchy, indicating faulty access to argument structure
representations for production and integration into syntactic contexts. Recovery 
of verb processing in agrammatism, however, has received little attention and no 
studies have examined the neural mechanisms associated with improved verb and
argument structure processing. In the present study we trained agrammatic
individuals on verbs with complex argument structure in sentence contexts and
examined generalization to verbs with less complex argument structure. The neural
substrates of improved verb production were examined using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI).
METHODS: Eight individuals with chronic agrammatic aphasia participated in the
study (four experimental and four control participants). Production of
three-argument verbs in active sentences was trained using a sentence generation 
task emphasizing the verb's argument structure and the thematic roles of
sentential noun phrases. Before and after training, production of trained and
untrained verbs was tested in naming and sentence production and fMRI scans were 
obtained, using an action naming task.
RESULTS: Significant pre- to post-training improvement in trained and untrained
(one- and two-argument) verbs was found for treated, but not control,
participants, with between-group differences found for verb naming, production of
verbs in sentences, and production of argument structure. fMRI activation derived
from post-treatment compared to pre-treatment scans revealed upregulation in
cortical regions implicated for verb and argument structure processing in healthy
controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Training verb deficits emphasizing argument structure and thematic
role mapping is effective for improving verb and sentence production and results 
in recruitment of neural networks engaged for verb and argument structure
processing in healthy individuals.

Anatomical segmentation of structures of interest is critical to quantitative
analysis in medical imaging. Several automated multi-atlas based segmentation
propagation methods that utilise manual delineations from multiple templates
appear promising. However, high levels of accuracy and reliability are needed for
use in diagnosis or in clinical trials. We propose a new local ranking strategy
for template selection based on the locally normalised cross correlation (LNCC)
and an extension to the classical STAPLE algorithm by Warfield et al. (2004),
which we refer to as STEPS for Similarity and Truth Estimation for Propagated
Segmentations. It addresses the well-known problems of local vs. global image
matching and the bias introduced in the performance estimation due to structure
size. We assessed the method on hippocampal segmentation using a leave-one-out
cross validation with optimised model parameters; STEPS achieved a mean Dice
score of 0.925 when compared with manual segmentation. This was significantly
better in terms of segmentation accuracy when compared to other state-of-the-art 
fusion techniques. Furthermore, due to the finer anatomical scale, STEPS also
obtains more accurate segmentations even when using only a third of the
templates, reducing the dependence on large template databases. Using a subset of
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) scans from different MRI
imaging systems and protocols, STEPS yielded similarly accurate segmentations
(Dice=0.903). A cross-sectional and longitudinal hippocampal volumetric study was
performed on the ADNI database. Mean±SD hippocampal volume (mm(3)) was 5195 ± 656
for controls; 4786 ± 781 for MCI; and 4427 ± 903 for Alzheimer's disease patients
and hippocampal atrophy rates (%/year) of 1.09 ± 3.0, 2.74 ± 3.5 and 4.04 ± 3.6
respectively. Statistically significant (p<10(-3)) differences were found between
disease groups for both hippocampal volume and volume change rates. Finally,
STEPS was also applied in a multi-label segmentation propagation scenario using a
leave-one-out cross validation, in order to parcellate 83 separate structures of 
the brain. Comparisons of STEPS with state-of-the-art multi-label fusion
algorithms showed statistically significant segmentation accuracy improvements
(p<10(-4)) in several key structures.

The logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is characterised by
impaired sentence repetition and word retrieval difficulties. Post mortem
studies, amyloid imaging and CSF tau/Aβ measurements suggest Alzheimer's disease 
(AD) pathology as the underlying cause. Relatively little is known about patterns
of progression in patients with the logopenic variant of PPA. 21 patients (3 with
post mortem confirmation of AD and 5 with positive amyloid PIB-PET scans) were
studied with longitudinal T1-weighted MR imaging (mean interscan interval
1.2years) using volumetric analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Baseline
imaging showed asymmetrical (left greater than right) involvement of the
posterior superior temporal and inferior parietal lobes as well as posterior
cingulate and medial temporal lobes. The whole brain rate of volume loss was 2.0%
per year with a greater rate of left hemisphere atrophy (2.3%/year) than right
hemisphere (1.6%/year). Longitudinal VBM analysis showed increasing involvement
of other areas in the left hemisphere (temporal, parietal, frontal and caudate)
and atrophy of areas in the right hemisphere that had been involved earlier in
the disease in the left hemisphere, particularly posterior cingulate/precuneus.
With disease progression there was worsening of anomia, sentence repetition and
sentence comprehension but consistent with the spread of imaging changes also
deficits in single word comprehension, single word repetition and verbal memory. 
This study shows that the logopenic variant of PPA remains an asymmetrical
disease, with spread through the left hemisphere language network but also
involvement to a lesser degree of regions in the right hemisphere that mirror the
earlier left hemisphere changes.

Typical Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by an impaired form of
associative memory, recollection, that includes the controlled retrieval of
associations. In contrast, familiarity-based memory for individual items may
sometimes be preserved in the early stages of the disease. This is the first
study that directly examines whole-brain regional activity during one core aspect
of the recollection function: associative controlled episodic retrieval (CER),
contrasted to item familiarity in AD patients. Cerebral activity related to
associative CER and item familiarity in AD patients and healthy controls (HCs)
was measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging during a word-pair
recognition task to which the process dissociation procedure was applied. Some
patients had null CER estimates (AD-), whereas others did show some CER abilities
(AD+), although significantly less than HC. In contrast, familiarity estimates
were equivalent in the three groups. In AD+, as in controls, associative CER
activated the inferior precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). When
performing group comparisons, no region was found to be significantly more
activated during CER in HC than AD+ and vice versa. However, during associative
CER, functional connectivity between this region and the hippocampus, the
inferior parietal and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) was significantly
higher in HC than in AD+. In all three groups, item familiarity was related to
activation along the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). In conclusion, whereas the
preserved automatic detection of an old item (without retrieval of accurate word 
association) is related to parietal activation centred on the IPS, the inferior
precuneus/PCC supports associative CER ability in AD patients, as in HC. However,
AD patients have deficient functional connectivity during associative CER,
suggesting that the residual recollection function in these patients might be
impoverished by the lack of some recollection-related aspects such as autonoetic 
quality, episodic details and verification.

Abnormal functional connectivity of the default mode network in remitted
late-onset depression.

BACKGROUND: The functional neural network model has been a major method used to
investigate mechanisms of neuropsychopathy. There is considerable evidence that
late-onset depression (LOD) is the prodrome, or the early clinical manifestation,
of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The default mode network (DMN) is one of the neural 
networks that can be used to explore the complex relationships between depressive
symptoms, episodic memory deficits and other cognitive impairments. To date, no
study has directly linked the DMN to LOD while focusing on episodic memory and
the influence of apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor for AD in
LOD patients.
METHODS: In total, 33 remitted LOD (rLOD) patients and 33 elderly controls
underwent fMRI scanning using low-frequency BOLD signal imaging during the
resting state and during an episodic memory task. Furthermore, function-based
functional connectivities (FCs) in the region of interesting (ROI) (posterior
cingulate cortex (PCC) of the DMN) were analysed to explore interactions between 
disease states, task states and genetic risk factors (APOE4).
RESULTS: Compared to healthy control subjects (HC), the FCs between the PCC and
the right medial temporal lobe of the rLOD patients were significantly stronger
during rest (p<0.005) and significantly weaker (p<0.05) during performance of the
task. The mode of change from rest to task performance in the HC was in contrast 
to the mode of change in the rLOD patients. The FCs of the rLOD patients without 
APOE4 were significantly increased (p<0.05) in the resting state, but the rLOD
patients who carried APOE4 showed a trend toward decreased FCs.
LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small. While the study was cross-sectional, we
did not differentiate between the various types of antidepressants the patients
used, which may have had different effects on cognitive function, especially on
episodic memory.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggested that rLOD might be the prodrome, or the early
clinical manifestation, of AD and that rLOD patients with APOE4 showed an
increased risk for episodic memory decline and AD.

BACKGROUND: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) is typically considered to be a
visual syndrome, primarily characterised by progressive impairment of
visuoperceptual and visuospatial skills. However, patients commonly describe
early difficulties with word retrieval. This paper details the first systematic
analysis of linguistic function in PCA. Characterising and quantifying the
aphasia associated with PCA is important for clarifying diagnostic and selection 
criteria for clinical and research studies.
METHODS: 15 patients with PCA, seven patients with logopenic/phonological aphasia
(LPA) and 18 age matched healthy participants completed a detailed battery of
linguistic tests evaluating auditory input processing, repetition and working
memory, lexical and grammatical comprehension, single word retrieval and fluency,
and spontaneous speech.
RESULTS: Relative to healthy controls, PCA patients exhibited language
impairments across all of the domains examined, but with anomia, reduced phonemic
fluency and slowed speech rate the most prominent deficits. PCA performance most 
closely resembled that of LPA patients on tests of auditory input processing,
repetition and digit span, but was relatively stronger on tasks of comprehension 
and spontaneous speech.
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrates that in addition to the well reported
degradation of vision, literacy and numeracy, PCA is characterised by progressive
oral language dysfunction with prominent word retrieval difficulties. Overlap in 
the linguistic profiles of PCA and LPA, which are both most commonly caused by
Alzheimer's disease, further emphasises the notion of a phenotypic continuum
between typical and atypical manifestations of the disease. Clarifying the
boundaries between Alzheimer's disease phenotypes has important implications for 
diagnosis, clinical trial recruitment and investigations into biological factors 
driving phenotypic heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease. Rehabilitation
strategies to ameliorate the phonological deficit in PCA are required.

Functional brain imaging is a common tool in monitoring the progression of
neurodegenerative and neurological disorders. Identifying functional brain
imaging derived features that can accurately detect neurological disease is of
primary importance to the medical community. Research in computer vision
techniques to identify objects in photographs have reported high accuracies in
that domain, but their direct applicability to identifying disease in functional 
imaging is still under investigation in the medical community. In particular,
Serre et al. (: In: IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition
(CVPR-05). pp 994-1000) introduced a biophysically inspired filtering method
emulating visual processing in striate cortex which they applied to perform
object recognition in photographs. In this work, the model described by Serre et 
al. [2005] is extended to three-dimensional volumetric images to perform signal
detection in functional brain imaging (PET, SPECT). The filter outputs are used
to train both neural network and logistic regression classifiers and tested on
two distinct datasets: ADNI Alzheimer's disease 2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) PET and
National Football League players Tc99m HMPAO SPECT. The filtering pipeline is
analyzed to identify which steps are most important for classification accuracy. 
Our results compare favorably with other published classification results and
outperform those of a blinded expert human rater, suggesting the utility of this 
approach.

Rare autosomal dominant mutations result in familial Alzheimer's disease (FAD)
with a relatively consistent age of onset within families. This provides an
estimate of years until disease onset (relative age) in mutation carriers.
Increased AD risk has been associated with differences in functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during memory tasks, but most of these studies 
have focused on possession of apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE4), a risk factor,
but not causative variant, of late-onset AD. Evaluation of fMRI activity in
presymptomatic FAD mutation carriers versus noncarriers provides insight into
preclinical changes in those who will certainly develop AD in a prescribed period
of time. Adults from FAD mutation-carrying families (nine mutation carriers,
eight noncarriers) underwent fMRI scanning while performing a memory task. We
examined fMRI signal differences between carriers and noncarriers, and how signal
related to fMRI task performance within mutation status group, controlling for
relative age and education. Mutation noncarriers had greater retrieval period
activity than carriers in several AD-relevant regions, including the left
hippocampus. Better performing noncarriers showed greater encoding period
activity including in the parahippocampal gyrus. Poorer performing carriers
showed greater retrieval period signal, including in the frontal and temporal
lobes, suggesting underlying pathological processes.

Neural networks supporting memory function decline with increasing age.
Accumulation of amyloid-β, a histopathological finding in Alzheimer's disease, is
a likely contributor. Posteromedial cortices (PMCs) are particularly vulnerable
to early amyloid pathology and play a role in both encoding and retrieval
processes. The extent to which aging and amyloid influence the ability to
modulate activity between these processes within the PMC was investigated by
combining positron emission tomography-amyloid imaging with functional magnetic
resonance imaging in cognitively normal older and young adults. Young subjects
exhibited a marked decrease in activity during encoding and an increase during
retrieval (also known as encoding/retrieval "flip"). Impaired ability to modulate
activity was associated with increasing age, greater amyloid burden, and worse
memory performance. In contrast, the hippocampus showed increased activity during
both encoding and retrieval, which was not related to these variables. These
findings support a specific link between amyloid pathology and neural dysfunction
in PMC and elucidate the underpinnings of age-related memory dysfunction.

Recent reports of functional and anatomical studies have provided evidence that
aberrant neural connectivity lies at the heart of many mental disorders.
Information related to neural networks has elucidated the nonlinear dynamical
complexity in brain signals over a range of temporal scales. The recent advent of
nonlinear analytic methods, which have served for the quantitative description of
the brain signal complexity, has provided new insights into aberrant neural
connectivity in many mental disorders. Although many studies have underpinned
aberrant neural connectivity, findings related to complexity behavior are still
inconsistent. This inconsistency might result from (i) heterogeneity in mental
disorders, (ii) analytical issues, (iii) interference of typical development and 
aging. First, most mental disorders are heterogeneous in their clinical feature
or intrinsic pathological mechanisms. Second, neurophysiologic output signals
from complex brain connectivity might be characterized with multiple time scales 
or frequencies. Finally, age-related brain complexity changes must be considered 
when investigating pathological brain because typical brain complexity is not
constant across generations. Future systematic studies addressing these issues
will greatly expand our knowledge of neural connections and dynamics related to
mental disorders.
